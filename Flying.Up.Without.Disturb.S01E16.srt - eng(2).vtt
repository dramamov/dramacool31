00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.479
Bei Jun, you do it.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.360
Your Highness,

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.039
seriously?

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:45.679
Do it.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.039
Your Highness.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.279
Just faking it?

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.960
No.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.679
Lady, did you summon me?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.439
It's noisy outside,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.480
what's happening?

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.040
The Second Prince

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.520
is asking the bodyguards to hit him.

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:17.719
What?

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.080
Who is he?

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.719
It's the Second Prince himself.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.439
Just faking it.

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.599
But the bodyguards said so.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.320
They wouldn't lie.

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.960
Well...

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:32.520
Impossible.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.920
If he truly

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.279
feels sorry,

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.320
he'd never torment himself.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040
Stop it!

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.839
This...

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.719
This is my apology.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.119
Satisfied?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.399
Are you crazy?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.480
Do you plan to

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.599
lock yourself

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.520
in the icehouse too?

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.439
If you want it...

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.920
You...

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.839
Stop it.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.480
I keep my promises.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.240
Alright.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760
You've severely injured,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.640
we're even now.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.559
I accept your apology,

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:19.719
but stop tormenting

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:20.679
yourself.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.920
We're even now?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.080
Yes, we're even.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.839
Do you have medicine?

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:35.040
What's wrong?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.520
Seems you're satisfied,

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.599
since you're willing to tend my wounds.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.520
Let the palace maids do it then.

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.719
My injury hasn't healed yet.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.159
You'd do it.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.520
Bear with it.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.960
This reminds me

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.520
of last time when I treated you

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.960
for your itching.

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.320
My itching?

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.799
Yes.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.799
To shield me

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.120
from poisonous thorns,

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.719
you got severe wounds.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.399
Though terribly itchy,

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.120
you feigned indifference.

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:33.560
Pity

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.640
you remember nothing.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.000
That

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.760
version of you

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.159
was aloof,

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.399
yet unexpected adorable.

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.359
Adorable?

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.239
Yes.

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:47.279
But this version of you

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.599
is not adorable at all.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.599
Be gentle.

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.359
Be gentle.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.000
Can't even endure this?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.880
You'd serve me

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.960
from tomorrow.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.680
No more stable duties.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.520
Here, Your Majesty.

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:21.440
Your Majesty.

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:25.120
Press harder.

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:26.399
Okay.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.960
Right.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.039
A few days ago,

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.080
the Crown Prince

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.159
fell from the horse.

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:32.399
How's he now?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.799
I heard he's awake.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.960
But no others details.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.799
The Second Prince's men

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.599
didn't tell a thing.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.320
At least, he's awake.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.799
An incident now

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.399
is ill-timed indeed.

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.000
Your Majesty,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.200
the Second Prince's bodyguard
requests audience.

00:05:57.799 --> 00:05:58.399
Granted.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.120
Yes.

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.719
Your Majesty, I pay my respects.

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:11.239
Your Majesty.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.279
Please uphold justice for me.

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.039
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:16.799
What does this mean?

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.279
The Second Prince ordered me

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:19.680
to present this person to you.

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:20.520
Among the steeds

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.919
he gifted to the Second Prince,

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.080
one got poisoned,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.320
so it went wild

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:26.039
and endangered the Crown Prince's life.

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:28.320
Your Majesty, please punish this person

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:29.279
for the Crown Prince.

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:30.560
Your Majesty.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.520
I am innocent.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.120
Your Majesty.

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:33.560
I am innocent.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.039
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:35.919
Your Majesty.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.919
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.719
I didn't do it.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:40.560
Your Majesty.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.880
The Emperor arrives.

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:45.799
Your Majesty.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.159
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.320
You fool!

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.120
Your Majesty.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.520
In that case,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.880
you told your brother to gift

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.120
the steeds to Huan Zong?

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:59.919
Yes, I did it.

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:01.039
The Second Prince

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.159
always troubles you.

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:03.359
I thought a simple prank

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:04.960
would teach him a lesson.

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.760
I never expected
it would end up like this

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.039
and harmed the Crown Prince.

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:10.919
I just wanted to make a simple prank.

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.080
What?

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.799
Think you're clever?

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.039
Your Majesty.

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.279
Your Majesty.

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:20.000
I wanted to

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:21.399
make him lose vigilance

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.680
then make the fatal blow.

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:24.320
Now,

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:27.560
you've alerted him.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.520
He'll surely...

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.839
W-What will he do?

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.080
You know it.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.120
Like his mother,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.399
he's a patient predator.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.200
Now he must be waiting

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.239
for his chance.

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.440
Your alert

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.200
forces him to take the initiative.

00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:45.839
What?

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:52.960
Kong Hou.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.399
Kong Hou.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.839
Where are you?

00:07:58.599 --> 00:07:59.520
Kong Hou.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.719
I'll find you.

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:03.479
Here.

00:08:16.039 --> 00:08:17.320
Your Highness.

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:19.239
Your Highness.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.039
What's wrong? Where does it hurt?

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:22.839
Found you, Kong Hou.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.680
Well played.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.320
You've been tricking me here.

00:08:26.159 --> 00:08:29.000
Second Brother said this is a tactic.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.200
You clever imp!

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.080
You clever imp!

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.239
I'll catch you.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.200
Stop it.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.040
Stay still.

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:51.119
Why is this person so tall?

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.160
My apologies.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.400
Are you done groping?

00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:58.680
Sorry.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.759
I didn't know it's you.

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:01.519
Are your back injuries healed?

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.848
Why are you running around?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.479
I told you

00:09:04.479 --> 00:09:05.479
my injuries healed.

00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:06.239
Stop nagging.

00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:06.920
Alright.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.320
You are quite eloquent.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.040
What's so funny?

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160
Let me ask you.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.440
Finished your studies?

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:20.639
Brother,

00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:23.320
grant me a day off.

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.800
You've promised me

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.119
to fly kites with me,

00:09:28.599 --> 00:09:30.519
yet always break your word.

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:32.759
Just fly kites with me,

00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:33.719
okay?

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.200
Please.

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:37.080
Exactly.

00:09:37.239 --> 00:09:38.160
My master said

00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:38.999
those who

00:09:38.999 --> 00:09:40.440
stay in the study

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:41.359
with books

00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:42.560
all day

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:44.639
will become dull scholars.

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:45.519
So,

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:46.639
let's go

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.960
fly kites.

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:50.239
Please.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.119
Please.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.080
Please.

00:09:52.119 --> 00:09:53.400
Please.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.560
Wait.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.160
Why are you coming along?

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.759
Aren't we going to fly kites?

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:02.999
No one invited you.

00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:11.400
Brother,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.560
I want her to go with us.

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:36.119
Why can't I fly it?

00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:37.759
Cheer up.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.839
Let me show you.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.440
See?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.719
So you can't do it either.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.680
I haven't flown

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.639
kites in ages.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.400
Here, I got this.

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:07.680
What?

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:08.879
To fly the kite.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.759
At your pace,

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:10.639
we won't fly a kite

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.479
by sunset.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.560
You understand nothing.

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:14.519
The weather is not suitable

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.599
for flying kites now.

00:11:15.719 --> 00:11:16.320
Got it?

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.440
It's soaring!

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:33.960
Kong Hou is amazing!

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.879
Your Highness,

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:35.879
look, is it

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:36.599
high enough?

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:37.479
Yes.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.719
I told you

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:40.440
the weather is not suitable today.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.239
Besides,

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.320
this kite suits you two.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.639
Too light for me.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.440
I see.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.519
So it's the kite's fault.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.599
Exactly.

00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:51.320
Your Highness,

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:52.879
let's challenge him.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.420
Shall we?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.280
Yes!

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.759
Brother, come on.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.359
No way.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:58.839
What if I won?

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:01.599
Your brother

00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:04.280
must be scared.

00:12:04.359 --> 00:12:05.320
Presumptuous!

00:12:05.719 --> 00:12:07.119
Just flying a kite.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:07.960
Come on.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.999
Ready?

00:12:15.119 --> 00:12:16.280
Go!

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.119
Kong Hou, go!

00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:34.479
Kong Hou, go!

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:35.839
Your Highness,

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:37.200
you're not doing it well.

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:38.560
Don't gloat yet.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.479
Now,

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.400
the real show begins.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.200
What did I say?

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.040
Don't gloat.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.680
Flying a kite

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.999
can't defeat me.

00:13:00.119 --> 00:13:01.040
Be careful!

00:13:12.239 --> 00:13:13.040
Kong Hou.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.999
The kite is heading for the tree.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:18.599
Bei Jun.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.560
It's okay, I can handle this.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.879
Look,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.400
you got the kite

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.040
stuck in the tree.

00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:43.440
Are you really

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.759
that clumsy?

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:45.759
Presumptuous!

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.759
Your Highness, look.

00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:48.800
He's bullying me.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.200
Stand up for me.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.160
Brother,

00:13:52.359 --> 00:13:53.519
you're wrong.

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:54.359
Kong Hou

00:13:54.359 --> 00:13:55.960
retrieved your kite.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.519
Moreover,

00:13:57.599 --> 00:13:59.479
she's so brilliant,

00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:01.280
adorable, and beautiful.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.800
You can't bully her.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.759
Clever you,

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:05.440
complaining me to the Crown Prince?

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.999
Look.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.119
Your brother

00:14:08.119 --> 00:14:09.639
always treats me this way.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.879
Brother,

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:12.200
could you

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.719
treat her better?

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:15.200
She is so kind.

00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:16.519
I want...

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.680
I want her

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.160
to stay by my side forever.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.320
But I'm too young

00:14:22.719 --> 00:14:24.400
to marry her.

00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:26.359
But Brother, you could marry her.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.160
Then she would

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.639
stay with me forever.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.999
Perfect!

00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:38.239
Perfect!

00:14:38.359 --> 00:14:39.960
Brother will marry Kong Hou!

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:42.599
Brother will marry Kong Hou!

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:56.960
Wake up.

00:15:57.479 --> 00:15:58.639
Go back to your room.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.040
You claimed to like me before,

00:16:10.359 --> 00:16:12.080
yet forgot me in an instant.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.920
Huan Zong,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.920
do you truly like me?

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.680
Well...

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:29.519
Wait.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.800
What are you doing?

00:16:32.999 --> 00:16:33.599
Have something

00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:34.119
to tell me?

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.160
Nothing.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.479
I just want to ask,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.320
when I hugged you,

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.119
why didn't you push me away?

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.080
I feared it'd wake my brother.

00:16:49.599 --> 00:16:50.680
That's it?

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.879
What else?

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:52.719
What do you think?

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.639
Nothing.

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:56.999
I just want to say,

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.560
I've caused you

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.680
a lot of trouble recently.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.800
Glad that you know it.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.559
Go ask others.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.600
I've never treated

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.559
anyone like this.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.999
You mean,

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.440
I'm the first

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.840
you've treated this way?

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.160
I'm so fortunate.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.239
What's on your mind?

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.719
I mean,

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.400
as a palace maid,

00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:18.880
overstepping your place

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.920
is treasonous.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.440
If you dare do it again,

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.600
you might get beheaded.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.479
You always warn me

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:25.400
that I might get beheaded.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.519
Huan Zong.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.999
You don't need to act

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:31.319
so fierce before me.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.640
I understand

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:34.319
you don't want

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:35.200
to behead anyone.

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:36.880
You're kind.

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:38.880
Think you know me well?

00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:40.400
You know nothing.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.559
Fine, I'll stop.

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:44.799
But

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.600
still,

00:17:47.519 --> 00:17:48.319
thank you.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.120
Wait.

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:55.360
Answer me some questions.

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:57.319
Fine.

00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:59.559
I'll be truthful where possible.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.600
The Crown Prince's incident
wasn't an accident,

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.279
right?

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.519
Right.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.719
The Emperor ordered it.

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:10.719
Right?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.039
Actually, he targeted

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:13.680
me.

00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:17.840
But my brother got caught in it.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.319
When I first entered the palace,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.960
I heard

00:18:21.999 --> 00:18:22.600
stories

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.519
of you two.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.319
But I didn't expect

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.400
there

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.079
would be someone so cruel

00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:30.400
to his own wife

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.160
and children

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:33.759
in this world.

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:37.200
Perhaps

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.640
the power struggles

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.239
will change anyone

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.680
into someone unrecognizable.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.719
I've actually forgotten

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.559
who I used to be.

00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:52.160
No, Huan Zong.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.519
You haven't changed.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.479
You're still yourself.

00:18:54.719 --> 00:18:56.360
You've never been

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.680
corrupted by power.

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:01.319
You only wanted
to protect the Crown Prince

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:03.559
and those around you.

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.799
What will you do next?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.840
Whatever you decide to do,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.920
I'll support you.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.840
How's the situation?

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.880
Rest assured.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.160
I've informed everyone.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.999
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.279
My elder brother entrusted

00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:23.239
you to my care,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.960
I will never

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.440
let you take risks.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.360
Now we must wait.

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:31.680
When the temple's completed,

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:33.920
he'll surely immerse
himself in cultivation.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.039
Then

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.239
it'll be our best chance

00:19:36.239 --> 00:19:37.440
to take actions.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.680
Yes.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.600
We'll wait for your command.

00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:50.880
Kong Hou has gone in for five days,

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:52.479
yet nothing happened at all.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.279
We might force our way in.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.279
Seriously?

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.279
We have inner demons.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:56.920
What if

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.799
our intrusion

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:58.759
affects the Young Master

00:19:58.759 --> 00:19:59.440
and Kong Hou?

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.799
I understand.

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.840
We can only wait idly here?

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.160
Don't worry.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.160
Kong Hou is smart.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.120
She's the only one

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:06.999
without inner demons.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.039
Just be patient.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.519
Moreover, Wu Xi mentioned

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.279
time in there

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:11.319
flows differently.

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:12.039
One day here,

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.079
ten days in there.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.719
The Concealment Pill will expire soon.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.440
Well...

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:17.559
If Kong Hou gets caught,

00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:18.360
or anything happens,

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.440
we'll force our way in.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:19.999
Okay?

00:20:36.479 --> 00:20:38.840
Every part of the temple

00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:40.279
will be constructed

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:42.400
with premium century-old timber.

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:43.719
All craftsmanship

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.960
will adhere

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.600
to the imperial highest standards.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.360
When Master Jin Yue arrives,

00:20:48.479 --> 00:20:50.079
he'll surely be pleased.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.319
Tell the Second Prince to handle

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:53.039
this properly.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.319
Understood.

00:20:55.479 --> 00:20:57.880
Your Majesty,
Master Jin Yue has replied.

00:21:07.616 --> 00:21:10.976
(Letter of Rejection
from Master Jin Yue)

00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:17.440
Your Majesty, calm down.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.680
Your Majesty, calm down.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:20.200
That old fool Jin Yue!

00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:22.319
I've shown utmost sincerity

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:24.120
to become his disciple.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.640
Yet he keeps rejecting me.

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:27.200
How ungrateful!

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.360
Never mind.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.440
In a few days,

00:21:32.999 --> 00:21:34.799
I'll invite him personally.

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:39.799
What's wrong?

00:21:44.239 --> 00:21:45.719
Why are you following me?

00:21:48.079 --> 00:21:49.200
Because

00:21:49.259 --> 00:21:49.759
I don't know

00:21:49.759 --> 00:21:50.880
what you're going to do.

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:51.960
What I am going to do

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:53.200
is none of your concern.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.799
Look,

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.640
if you don't tell me,

00:21:56.719 --> 00:21:58.039
how can I protect you

00:21:58.079 --> 00:21:58.640
well?

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.680
Just protect yourself.

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:02.600
Besides, it's improper if others see us.

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:03.999
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:05.600
People from your palace

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.239
all stroll around

00:22:07.239 --> 00:22:08.079
with a bunch

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.920
of eunuchs and palace maids.

00:22:10.039 --> 00:22:11.400
There's nothing special.

00:22:11.479 --> 00:22:12.239
Besides,

00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:13.680
bringing just me

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.920
is already discreet.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.840
I never take any palace maids.

00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:17.559
Besides,

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:19.160
no one would take you for a palace maid.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.319
Weird.

00:22:21.479 --> 00:22:22.600
If not a palace maid,

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.640
then what?

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:25.999
What do you think?

00:22:27.719 --> 00:22:29.719
Wonderful!

00:22:29.759 --> 00:22:31.519
Brother will marry Kong Hou!

00:22:32.479 --> 00:22:34.680
Brother will marry Kong Hou!

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:37.559
Thinking of something?

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.440
Nothing.

00:22:38.719 --> 00:22:39.640
Nothing special.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.600
My mind remains blank.

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.079
Then

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:42.999
why are you blushing?

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:45.880
Not at all.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.759
I was

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.999
just focusing

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.640
on recalling.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.880
Exactly, I thought the same.

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.360
It'd be improper to follow you

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.039
all along.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.120
So,

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:01.719
you should follow me instead.

00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:04.319
Why would I follow you?

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.120
You'll tell me

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.120
where you want to go,

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.999
and I'll lead the way.

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:09.120
Just give me directions.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.319
Fine.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.200
I'll go to the Crown Prince.

00:23:13.479 --> 00:23:14.360
Just ahead.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.239
Lead the way.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.519
I see.

00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:19.600
Come, follow me.

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:26.400
Your Highness.

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:27.840
What's happened? Why the panic?

00:23:27.904 --> 00:23:30.112
Consort Qi sent someone
to take the Crown Prince away.

00:23:30.112 --> 00:23:30.600
What?

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.559
Here, try this.

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.120
I made it for you.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.960
I'm full now.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.559
I won't eat.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.960
This carries my sincere thoughts.

00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:50.039
Here, Your Highness.

00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:52.960
Open your mouth and eat!

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.400
Your Highness,

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.719
can you feel anything

00:24:01.719 --> 00:24:03.039
here?

00:24:04.719 --> 00:24:05.719
Here

00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:07.880
lies a prince just like you.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.719
But here's the difference.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.039
He will become your Father's

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.479
most cherished son.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.640
And you

00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:15.559
will be the most pitiful child

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:17.759
in the palace.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.600
Think your Second Brother

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.519
cares for you most?

00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:23.680
Let me tell you,

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:25.479
it's all fake.

00:24:25.479 --> 00:24:26.600
That's not true.

00:24:27.479 --> 00:24:29.759
He cares for you most.

00:24:30.999 --> 00:24:31.759
Do you know

00:24:31.759 --> 00:24:32.759
your Eldest Brother

00:24:32.759 --> 00:24:34.120
got killed by him?

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.920
One day,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.680
he'll kill you too.

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:39.360
I don't believe you!

00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:41.120
You will die more tragically than him.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.319
Beheading is mercy.

00:24:42.319 --> 00:24:43.840
Know the Lingchi execution?

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.680
No! I won't listen.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.519
They'd wrap a fishnet

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.360
around your body,

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.319
the slice your meat

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.400
through the net holes

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.880
piece by piece

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.960
for three days.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.880
You might survive,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.440
but then

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.519
you'd only be a bloody skeleton.

00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:57.319
Stop it!

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.239
Your Majesty.

00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:04.559
What exactly happened?

00:25:05.479 --> 00:25:06.640
I made

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.120
a bowl of fish soup

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.640
for the Crown Prince.

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:11.920
And I

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.239
unintentionally revealed

00:25:13.239 --> 00:25:14.640
my pregnancy.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.440
But he

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.319
attacked me...

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.640
My belly!

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.440
It aches terribly!

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.640
My belly!

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.079
Your Majesty, uphold justice for me!

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:29.039
You!

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.960
Father, no!

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:38.960
You!

00:26:00.239 --> 00:26:01.440
Brother.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.719
I didn't mean to.

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:08.719
I really didn't.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.400
I know it.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.559
I trust you.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.079
Don't be afraid.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.559
No one can harm you.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:20.880
Tell me

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.200
what happened today

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.279
in detail.

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:26.440
I always believe you.

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:29.719
She said...

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.079
She said...

00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:47.880
Bei Jun.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.920
What happened?

00:26:49.952 --> 00:26:51.488
Her Highness had a miscarriage risk.

00:26:51.488 --> 00:26:52.640
And His Majesty is furious.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.999
Can you get us in?

00:26:53.999 --> 00:26:56.352
We're worried about
the Second Prince and the Crown Prince.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.479
Bei Jun,

00:26:57.759 --> 00:26:58.880
young lady,

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:00.759
I want to help.

00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:01.600
But

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.880
if I take you both in

00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:04.680
and we get caught,

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.079
we'll all be beheaded.

00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:08.600
The Second Prince is His Majesty's son.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.799
He should be fine.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.279
You may leave. Thank you.

00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:16.759
Seems we can't get in.

00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:17.920
We'll have to wait.

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:21.319
Your Majesty,

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:23.079
Her Highness is blessed.

00:27:23.079 --> 00:27:25.400
The pregnancy remains stable.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.239
She merely suffered a fright

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.479
and needs calming herbs

00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:31.160
to recover fully.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.400
Very well.

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:33.559
You may leave.

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:34.640
Yes.

00:27:39.999 --> 00:27:41.279
Your Majesty,

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.079
the Second Prince is kneeling outside

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.079
and claiming

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:45.920
to discuss something with you alone.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:46.840
I won't see him.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.200
The Crown Prince claims

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.920
there might be a hidden secret

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.799
in this incident.

00:27:54.759 --> 00:27:56.279
I said no.

00:27:56.479 --> 00:27:57.559
You may leave.

00:27:57.559 --> 00:27:58.400
Yes.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.039
All of you, leave.

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:04.200
Yes.

00:28:06.759 --> 00:28:08.160
Your Majesty!

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.440
Shut up.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.279
The imperial physician said

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:12.840
you had no miscarriage risk.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.600
Drop the act.

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:16.479
But I acted so

00:28:16.479 --> 00:28:18.600
just for you.

00:28:30.759 --> 00:28:31.999
Are you tired?

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.440
Take a nap.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.559
Brother.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.200
I'm fine.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.960
Your Highness,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.519
His Majesty said Consort Qi

00:28:45.519 --> 00:28:47.039
needs rest for days.

00:28:47.239 --> 00:28:48.600
Just put

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.920
today's incident aside.

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:52.840
The Crown Prince

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:54.279
has to be confined

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:55.559
to quarters

00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:56.840
until Consort Qi recovers.

00:28:56.999 --> 00:28:59.160
I demand to see Father now!

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.920
Take care, Your Highnesses.

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:08.120
Brother.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.160
Fear not.

00:29:10.479 --> 00:29:11.680
I'm here.

00:29:13.479 --> 00:29:14.479
Father!

00:29:15.079 --> 00:29:16.239
My brother is young

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.640
and kind.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.999
He'd never harm
Consort Qi intentionally.

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:23.079
There must be a misunderstanding.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.200
Since Consort Qi got a scare today,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.559
I'll kneel at the ancestral temple

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.960
to pray for

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.840
the unborn child.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.120
I'll take my leave.

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:47.519
Let's go.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.920
Brother.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.120
My legs are numb.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.160
I'll carry you.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.600
Your Majesty.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.999
Your Majesty.

00:30:19.999 --> 00:30:21.400
What does

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.759
the Second Prince mean?

00:30:22.759 --> 00:30:23.799
Misunderstanding?

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.519
Does he mean

00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:26.160
I'd slander

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.719
the Crown Prince?

00:30:27.719 --> 00:30:29.999
Stand up for me.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.920
You understand nothing.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.400
He's giving me a warning.

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:36.719
If I severely punish

00:30:36.999 --> 00:30:38.759
the Crown Prince

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:39.759
based on what you said,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.960
he won't

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.079
let this off.

00:30:42.279 --> 00:30:43.559
What does he want?

00:30:43.719 --> 00:30:45.799
Does he intend to rebel?

00:30:49.479 --> 00:30:50.880
Given his temperament,

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.400
it's not the right timing

00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:56.120
to rebel now.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.079
Hasty actions

00:30:57.079 --> 00:30:58.479
will only harm us.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.440
Then

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.600
are we letting this go?

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.360
Our priority now

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:05.239
is to convince

00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:06.640
that Jin Yue

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.640
to assist my cultivation.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.360
No further trouble allowed.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.920
We can always find opportunities

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.799
in the future.

00:31:15.759 --> 00:31:17.039
As for you,

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.239
behave yourself recently.

00:31:19.239 --> 00:31:20.440
Don't cause me trouble.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.200
Understood.

00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:33.999
Your Highness.

00:31:34.479 --> 00:31:35.920
Kong Hou.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.120
Kong Hou.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.920
There, there.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.559
When we return,

00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:40.319
you can have treats

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:41.799
and play whatever you want.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.120
What's so funny?

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.719
You and Lady Kong Hou

00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:47.719
along with His Highness,

00:31:47.719 --> 00:31:48.999
are like a family.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.759
You know Brother will marry Kong Hou?

00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:56.519
Y-Your Highness.

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:57.279
Enough.

00:31:57.719 --> 00:31:59.360
Escort the Crown Prince back.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.400
Your Highness.

00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:05.799
Your Highness.

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:06.400
We are here

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.319
to escort His Highness
back to the palace.

00:32:08.479 --> 00:32:09.360
No need.

00:32:09.559 --> 00:32:10.920
I'll personally attend to him.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.239
But...

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.880
Your Highness,

00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:15.640
per His Majesty's decree,

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.519
we must escort His Highness back

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:18.759
to his confinement.

00:32:18.759 --> 00:32:19.840
Brother.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.799
I don't want it.

00:32:22.999 --> 00:32:23.880
Don't worry.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.479
During your confinement,

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.360
Bei Jun will guard you.

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:34.160
Your Highness.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.880
Rest assured.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.719
I will defend the Crown Prince
with my life.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880
Where are you going?

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:54.160
Starting today,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.039
no need to follow me.

00:32:57.559 --> 00:32:58.319
Huan Zong.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.160
He...

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:28.576
(Memorial Tablet of the Late Empress)

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.960
I told you not to follow me.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.719
Why are you following me?

00:33:51.479 --> 00:33:52.799
I can't figure out

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.960
why you're

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.999
kneeling here.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.239
I kneel

00:33:56.239 --> 00:33:57.880
before memorial tablets of our ancestors

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.719
and my mother

00:33:59.719 --> 00:34:01.200
to keep him in check.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.079
Otherwise, he'll do more harm

00:34:03.079 --> 00:34:04.120
toward my brother.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.719
Do you intend

00:34:05.719 --> 00:34:06.840
to keep kneeling like this?

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.440
I'll kneel until he comes.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.720
Let me ask you,

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.599
when will you make your move?

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.840
What do you mean?

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.760
I know everything.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.519
The Emperor is ruthless,

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.880
and you seek vengeance.

00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:23.840
This doesn't concern you. Leave.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.400
I told you

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:27.199
I came here for you.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.320
No matter what happens

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.360
or what challenges arise,

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.800
I'll be with you.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.240
(The Concealment Pill's effect)

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.400
(is about to expire.)

00:35:02.272 --> 00:35:03.904
(Memorial Tablet of the Late Empress)

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:07.079
How's it going?

00:35:07.999 --> 00:35:09.240
The Second Prince is still

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.079
kneeling at the ancestral temple.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.920
Just let him

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.320
kneel.

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:19.479
Your Majesty!

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:20.440
Your Majesty!

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.400
Why the panic?

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.559
Your Majesty,
Master Jin Yue has responded.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.119
Has he changed his mind?

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.440
(To Emperor Jing Hong,)

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.159
(I previously received word
from Master Hong Yan,)

00:35:37.159 --> 00:35:38.960
(Yuexing Sect's leader,)

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.360
(that in the imperial family
of Lingyou Realm,)

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.880
(there exists an extraordinary)

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.320
(cultivation prodigy.)

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.559
(After analyzing
every imperial family member's)

00:35:46.559 --> 00:35:48.760
(birth charts,)

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.920
(I confirm this person
to be Second Prince Huan Zong.)

00:35:52.679 --> 00:35:53.999
(Liuguang Sect)

00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:55.240
(is the foremost sect)

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.559
(in the Lingyou Realm.)

00:35:56.559 --> 00:35:58.999
(I wish to accept
the Second Prince as my disciple.)

00:35:58.999 --> 00:36:00.800
(I will nurture him diligently.)

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.840
(When he achieves mastery,)

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.400
(he'll bring glory
to the imperial family)

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.159
(and fortune to you.)

00:36:07.159 --> 00:36:09.880
(I humbly request your approval.)

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:15.760
That old fool Jin Yue!

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.119
He refused me

00:36:18.639 --> 00:36:19.639
and set his sights on

00:36:19.639 --> 00:36:20.920
Huan Zong?

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.400
His ambitions are vicious.

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:25.280
If he achieves mastery,

00:36:25.479 --> 00:36:27.360
this nation would be his.

00:36:27.559 --> 00:36:28.800
I'll never permit

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.119
him to join Liuguang Sect.

00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:31.400
Guards!

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.800
Pass on my decree.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.559
Huan Zong, what's happening?

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.840
Someone's here.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.639
They're finally making their move.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.400
What?

00:36:54.039 --> 00:36:54.720
Wait.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.679
This day is inevitable.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.599
Huan Zong.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.240
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:03.679
Who exactly are you?

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.999
Why do I feel I've seen you before?

00:37:05.999 --> 00:37:07.400
Who am I? You...

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.720
You'll find out later.

00:37:19.456 --> 00:37:20.832
(Show No Mercy)

00:37:25.344 --> 00:37:27.136
(Ancestral Temple)

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.199
Your Highness,

00:37:30.199 --> 00:37:31.360
we'll escort you.

00:37:49.159 --> 00:37:49.880
Huan Zong.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.960
What's your plan?

00:37:52.519 --> 00:37:53.679
Close your eyes.

00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:55.079
What do you want?

00:37:55.079 --> 00:37:55.920
Don't ask.

00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:02.840
At least you'll survive.

00:38:03.479 --> 00:38:05.119
Take her somewhere safe.

00:38:05.479 --> 00:38:07.079
(I can't abandon my brother.)

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.599
Brother, where are you?

00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:22.112
His Majesty summons the Crown Prince.

00:38:22.112 --> 00:38:22.840
Resist,

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.440
and we'll show no mercy.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.039
Brother, I'm scared.

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:30.960
Brother, where are you?

00:38:41.559 --> 00:38:42.559
How's it going?

00:38:42.559 --> 00:38:44.599
The Second Prince and his faction
are coming.

00:38:47.039 --> 00:38:48.160
Pass on my decree.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.496
The Second Prince shows no loyalty
and schemes rebellion.

00:38:50.496 --> 00:38:51.360
Catch him.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.119
If he resists, kill him.

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:53.760
Understood!

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.920
Bei Jun.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.440
I don't want to go.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.639
Crown Prince, don't fear.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.720
The Second Prince

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.679
will come to save us.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.199
I'm here, Father.

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:33.840
Brother, I'm scared.

00:39:36.039 --> 00:39:37.519
Bring it on at me.

00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:38.320
Let my brother go.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.199
Huan Zong.

00:39:41.199 --> 00:39:42.599
You defy kinship.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.119
I must uphold justice and kill you.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.999
You want to give in

00:39:46.999 --> 00:39:47.960
and accept punishment,

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.880
or watch your brother

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.360
get killed?

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.159
Harm my brother,

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.159
and I'll take your life now!

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.039
Seize him!

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.240
The arrows are poisoned.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.320
Protect the Crown Prince.

00:40:44.199 --> 00:40:45.760
Stop the carriage!

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.920
What's going on?

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.720
Lady,

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.479
I was ordered to send you away.

00:40:49.999 --> 00:40:50.679
Huan Zong.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.440
Let me go.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.679
Huan Zong is in danger.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.119
Sorry I can't.

00:40:55.479 --> 00:40:57.079
Huan Zong is in danger.

00:40:57.079 --> 00:40:58.159
Let me go!

00:40:58.159 --> 00:40:59.440
Let me return.

00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:02.559
Kong Hou.

00:41:02.559 --> 00:41:03.559
Calm down.

00:41:03.559 --> 00:41:04.960
Think it over.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.440
This illusion is bizarre.

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:09.599
If Huan Zong dies in here,

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:10.440
his physical body

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.720
may never awaken.

00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:12.880
All our efforts

00:41:13.199 --> 00:41:14.960
will be wasted

00:41:15.159 --> 00:41:16.720
and Huan Zong will be in great danger.

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:26.159
Don't let them leave alive.

00:41:41.559 --> 00:41:42.559
Your Highness.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.800
Leave!

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.599
Bei Jun.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.320
Brother.

00:42:00.039 --> 00:42:00.720
Brother.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.599
Stop.

00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:05.800
I'll deal

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.639
with them myself.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.999
Brother, it hurts.

00:42:10.999 --> 00:42:11.840
It's okay.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.720
It's okay.

00:42:15.079 --> 00:42:15.999
I'm here.

00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:17.519
I'm here.

00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:25.039
It's okay.

00:42:25.479 --> 00:42:28.440
Brother, I'm tired.

00:42:29.999 --> 00:42:32.519
Please stay here

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.440
with me.
