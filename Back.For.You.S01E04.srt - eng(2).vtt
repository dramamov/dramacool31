kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.440
It's you.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.040
Don't run.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.600
You get in the car first.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.040
Okay.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.640
Did you get the message I sent you?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.200
Why didn't you answer my call?

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.520
Didn't I already tell you?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.000
Su Ruo's death was just an accident.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.400
Stop getting involved for no reason.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.680
If he has nothing to hide,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.640
why would he run?

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.280
If it's late at night

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.800
and a stranger comes at you,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.840
you'd run too.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.240
But you saw the footage, right?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.520
The night Su Ruo had her accident,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.720
he stayed in that building

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.800
and didn't come out all night.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.240
He showed up again last night.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.640
That's quite a coincidence.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.600
It is a coincidence.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.320
That's why we're investigating.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.760
So, how's it going?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.360
Did you check last night's footage?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440
Is it the same person as the night Su Ruo died?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.400
It's the same person.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.320
Did you catch him?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.720
Do you know where he lives?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.360
Even if you can't arrest him,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.920
you could at least keep him under surveillance.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920
Let me tell you again:

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.040
The cause of the accident still needs investigation.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.160
Alright.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.560
Then I'll give you another clue.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.480
I don't know where he lives now,

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.160
but fifteen years ago

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.360
he lived in Jianghong Community, Area 3,
Building 3, Unit 2, Room 201.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.320
Where did he live fifteen years ago?

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.480
How do you know that?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.800
Fifteen years ago, I...

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.920
I lived close to Su Ruo.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.000
I've seen that person before.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.320
You remember things from fifteen years ago so clearly?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.640
Your classmate is quite interesting.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.160
The clues you have

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.840
match our investigation perfectly.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.080
That person showing up at the scene might be a coincidence,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.320
but he lived below Su Ruo fifteen years ago.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.360
That's definitely true.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.520
Why would such a coincidence happen?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.440
He must have some connection to Su Ruo.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.000
At the very least, they know each other.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.600
If only I could go back and check again,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.640
that would be great.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.520
As a researcher,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.480
I know how dangerous this is.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.520
But

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.000
I want to do something for her.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.120
Give up.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.960
Ability.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.080
It's really back again.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Banana.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.600
Banana.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.080
We're cleaning the designated area together today.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.520
The top priority

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.120
is to find the person in the footage quickly.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.120
Su Ruo.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.800
I need to leave campus for a bit.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.120
Can you cover for me?

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.280
If the teacher asks later,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.040
just say

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.160
If the teacher asks,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.960
Say what?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.200
Director.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.760
You look so young, Director.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.000
Let me ask you:

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.880
Do you realize your mistake?

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160
What mistake?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.320
Playing dumb.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.360
Teacher, I really don't know what happened before.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.880
Why did you throw trash

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.520
in your own designated cleaning area?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.600
Throwing trash in your own cleaning area...

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.360
So I've come back to this moment.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.040
Feels like before.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.840
What do you mean, before?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.760
It's right now.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.320
I just saw it five minutes ago.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.080
The leaves you swept up here,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.360
you dumped them right here.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760
How could you do something

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.200
so outrageous and crazy?

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.600
Director, I...

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.160
What do you mean, "I"?

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.000
Don't explain to me.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.640
I know your little tricks.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.760
I've been Director for so many years,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.040
I can see through things like this.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.520
You should focus your mind on studying,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.040
not on all that nonsense.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.640
You're wasting your youth.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.960
Doing this

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.520
is just because your class

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.600
has a test early in the morning.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.880
You don't want to take the test,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.000
so you're wasting time here.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.760
Slacking off.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.760
Lazy cleaning.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.840
You really have sharp eyes.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.880
No wonder you'll be the next principal.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.840
What did you say?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.880
I mean,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.520
you have sharp eyes.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.600
And a broad vision.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.760
You'll definitely be the next principal.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.600
You're too young to talk nonsense.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.320
That's not your concern.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.880
You're in your final year now.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.040
You need to focus on studying in senior year, understand?

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.480
Okay, Director.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.080
I'll go back to class after cleaning.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.040
Mm.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.840
Su Ruo.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.680
Su Ruo.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.480
You're a good student.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.000
Don't let

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.320
someone lead you astray.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.040
Director.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.800
I didn't throw trash in the cleaning area.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.160
You didn't throw trash in the cleaning area,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.800
but you're in the same group as him.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.080
He threw trash everywhere.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.840
Why didn't you stop him?

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.600
I...

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.720
Yu Xingchen.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.160
Wait for me in the classroom after cleaning.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.760
Don't go anywhere, got it?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.920
You're looking for me?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.120
Yu Xingchen

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.880
Your clothes

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.320
Thanks

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.240
Where's the shirt I gave you?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.000
The one you gave me?

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.960
Let me check if he brought it.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.560
I'll take a look first.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.000
Don't you know if you brought it?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.920
I really don't know.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.240
Looks like you didn't bring it.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.520
What are you whispering about?

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.720
Come on

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.680
Want some? I'll share half.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.560
No, thanks.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.240
Something's up.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.920
Su Ruo helped Yu Xingchen with laundry!

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.120
Big news!

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.400
Su Ruo did Yu Xingchen's laundry.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.320
Don't take it to heart.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.000
They'll forget about it soon.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.040
It's fine with me.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.480
It's not a big deal anyway.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.240
What's going on?

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.520
My clothes got wet.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.680
Su Ruo, top student, always helps others.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.640
She washed my clothes for me.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.840
Is there a problem?

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.800
I think there is.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.520
What's the problem?

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.080
You think Su Ruo isn't

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.760
a good, helpful, top student?

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.760
What's up with Yu Xingchen?

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.240
Did he lose his memory?

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.680
Come in

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240
Teacher Jiang

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.440
I'd like to take a few days off.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.000
There's something going on at home.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.560
I understand.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.720
Of course you can.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.840
Do you need any help from me?

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.400
Teacher Jiang

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.480
About my family issue,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.120
Did Yu Xingchen tell you?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.360
Where did Su Ruo go?

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.760
Her backpack's gone too.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.760
She probably went home.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.280
She left after the first class.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.720
No way, I have to go too.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.200
Let's go

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.760
Come back, sit down.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.000
Sit properly.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.800
I have an announcement.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.560
The National Olympic Chemistry Competition
is about to begin.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.760
Winning means bonus points for college entrance.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.840
Each class gets two spots.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.760
For our class,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.560
besides Xie Haohui,

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.640
who else wants to sign up?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.320
If not, I'll pick someone.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.280
Then

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.920
Su Ruo, it is.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.880
Su Ruo's been on leave for days.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.000
She's home alone.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.640
Isn't she close to the person on camera?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.520
Tomorrow afternoon,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.000
there's a special lecture for the competition.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.520
This lecture is very important.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.200
Su Ruo's been absent lately.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.640
Who wants to go

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.560
and let her know?

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.800
Teacher

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.760
I'll go tell Su Ruo.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.080
Why are you going?

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.880
I live nearby.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.760
And I run fast.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.400
Of course I'll go.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.160
Teacher, I'll go.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.720
Teacher, let me go.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.520
Aren't you going?

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.920
Chance to be alone, you know.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.240
Anyone can go, doesn't matter.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.760
First, make sure she gets the message.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.760
Second,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.080
don't tell me tomorrow

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.520
you didn't do your homework
because you went to find Su Ruo.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.600
So you skipped the assignment.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.680
Class rep, hand them out.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.760
On the night of the incident,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.880
that guy in the hoodie

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.200
also showed up at Su Ruo's neighborhood.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.240
He stayed in that building all night.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.160
And he was there again last night.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.400
Su Ruo

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.080
Su Ruo, are you home?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.680
Su Ruo, where are you?

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.320
Su Ruo

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.600
Su Ruo

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.360
It's me, Zhang Xun. Are you home?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.000
Why are you here?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.120
Just passing by.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.960
Why did you come?

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.200
I...

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.080
I was warming up running.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.320
Ran and ended up here.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.160
Just so you know,

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.760
I'm not lending you my homework today.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.160
She's actually not home.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.480
Where do you think she went?

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.920
Maybe she's on a date?

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.760
That's all you ever think about.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.680
Looks like I gave too little homework.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.120
Oh right

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.120
Did you hear something happened at Su Ruo's home?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.440
Bro, you already know?

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.600
How could I not know?

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.280
Honestly, whether you know or not

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.760
doesn't really matter.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.200
True.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.680
Yu Xingchen, why are you here?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.160
Go back, Su Ruo isn't home.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.880
Honestly, it doesn't matter if you're here or not.
