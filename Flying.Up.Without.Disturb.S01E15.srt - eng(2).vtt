00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.079
Your Highness,

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.079
you look full of vitality.

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:53.719
Did you sleep well last night?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.919
Well enough.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.520
Huan Zong.

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:01.120
Last night...

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:03.240
Last night, you didn't serve me well.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.520
Starting today,

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:05.760
you'll become a palace maid.

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.840
This uniform looks hideous.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.759
Stay close.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.279
Must you be so talkative?

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.640
No, brother...

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:20.599
What did you call me?

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.080
No, sir.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.240
Think about it.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.640
The color of this uniform

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.039
is truly tacky.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.680
If I dressed better,

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:30.680
wouldn't I work

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.800
with more enthusiasm?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.599
What?

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.439
You want to wear

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.159
royal attendant's garments?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.999
No. I wouldn't dare.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.319
Remember.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.960
Serving the Second Prince

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.759
is a great honor for you.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:43.680
Yes.

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:45.039
Then could you tell me

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.800
what the Second Prince normally likes

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.680
to eat

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.479
or to do for fun?

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.640
You dare investigate the Second Prince?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.039
(Huan Zong already suspects me)

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.360
(of being the Emperor's spy.)

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.520
(If rumors spread about me)

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.159
(inquiring about him,
it'd be disastrous.)

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.360
No, not really.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.759
I simply wanted

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:02.680
to better understand

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.999
how to serve him.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.719
Memorize the palace rules

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:06.840
and avoid trouble.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.080
Remember.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.159
Starting today,

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.200
this uniform

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.120
is your access token.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.640
You can only serve the Second Prince.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.520
If you disturb His Majesty

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.159
or nobles from other palaces,

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.200
it might cost your life.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.640
Yes.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.080
(How can I kill the Emperor if I can't)

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.200
(reach his chambers?)

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:27.999
(I can't)

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.279
(use my spiritual energy here.)

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.920
(If I actually get beheaded...)

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.680
(Forget it.)

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.240
(I'd better find another way first.)

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.640
Your Highness.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:58.599
What happened?

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.279
No. Nothing.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.719
Since you're awake,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.439
let me attend to your washing, okay?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.840
The cloth.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.560
Clumsy.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.239
What's that smell?

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.919
The sandalwood scent from the table.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.279
You're using a table-cleaning rag

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.080
to wipe my hands?

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:37.000
Let me wipe your hands.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.960
Stay back.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.359
Your clothes are dirtier than rags.

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:40.239
Go away!

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.880
Your Highness,

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:46.880
grant me a chance

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.440
to redeem myself, please?

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:49.719
No need.

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.000
Why so polite with me?

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:54.479
Come on. Sit properly.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.400
Gently!

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.880
Sorry. My mistake.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.599
It hurts!

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:13.799
Alight.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.520
I'm skilled at hairstyling.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.039
I told you it hurts. How dare you!

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.279
With your handling,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.320
I'll go bald.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.400
But tight styling

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.239
makes you look dashing,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.000
right?

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.239
In all my years,

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:42.760
I've never dressed in this way before.

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:45.520
Your skill is impressive.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.520
You flatter me.

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:48.760
You flatter me.

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:06.279
What's this?

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:17.039
If I'm not mistaken,

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.560
these should be porcelain shards
from a vase.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.760
But I really didn't mean to.

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:23.919
I just

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.320
broke this vase by accident.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.080
Besides,

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:27.080
these tiny fragments

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:28.440
can't possibly hurt anyone.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.960
Yes, they can't cause harm,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.159
but they reveal your carelessness.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.359
Clean this up.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.679
Got it.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.640
Stop grabbing.

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:54.479
I brought plenty.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.239
Enough for all.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.560
Look.

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:01.200
The spy the Emperor sent this time

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.520
acts utterly bizarre.

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:03.760
Why hasn't she asked us

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.799
where the Second Prince is

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.080
but just feeding fish here?

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:07.440
Keep your voice down.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.840
Let her do

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.599
whatever she wants.

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.799
We'll simply report everything
to His Highness.

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:14.080
You've

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:15.520
eaten my fish food.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.440
Now, help me analyze this situation.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.560
It seems

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:19.279
I won't be able

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:20.719
to kill the Emperor for now.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.320
But I can't just randomly make

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.039
Huan Zong kill his own father either.

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:27.359
That's beyond unreasonable.

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:29.840
He still doesn't trust me now.

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:31.640
If I act recklessly,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.719
might I end up harming him?

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.080
No.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.279
I have to find another way.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.640
I must make Huan Zong remember me.

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:45.640
If he could remember me,

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:47.479
he'd realize

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:48.799
everything here

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:50.279
is completely fake.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.159
He's so smart.

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:52.760
He will surely break his inner demon.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.080
But

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.880
how can I make him remember me?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.599
Thanks, Fish.

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:25.560
When this is over,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.560
food will be endless.

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:37.119
That spy

00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:39.160
fed fish all morning?

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:40.359
Yes.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.759
Also,

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:44.479
after His Highness attended court,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.239
she claimed

00:08:45.239 --> 00:08:46.239
she was still hungry

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:48.519
and ate a lot of food in the kitchen.

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:49.879
She even ate all your pastries

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:50.920
meant for today.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.999
Since you said

00:08:52.119 --> 00:08:53.639
she could do whatever she wants,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.479
we didn't dare stop her.

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:01.320
What

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:03.960
a novel tactic.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.040
What are you doing here alone?

00:09:19.239 --> 00:09:20.320
Your Highness,

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.399
come look.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.160
All the koi fish are belly-up.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.280
They're all dead.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.280
You poisoned these fish.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.399
No.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.320
I didn't poison them.

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:32.960
I don't know what happened.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.239
What scheme...

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.160
What scheme are you brewing?

00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:12.560
How could you think

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.119
of ambushing me in a way like that?

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.040
Choose a deeper pond next time.

00:10:16.119 --> 00:10:17.999
This one's too shallow to drown in.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.200
I truly never intended to harm you.

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.280
I just

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.200
wanted

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.320
to help you recall

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.999
what happened in the past.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.119
You mentioned earlier

00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:36.840
wanting to help me recall the past.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.759
What is it?

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:39.639
I'm warning you.

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:40.759
You should make the story

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:41.999
more convincing this time.

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:43.639
I'm telling the truth.

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:44.599
Back then,

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:46.800
I was chasing a scavenger

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.479
when I accidentally tumbled

00:10:48.479 --> 00:10:49.599
down a hillside.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:50.359
Then

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.399
you appeared by the riverside

00:10:52.479 --> 00:10:54.759
with your attendant named Lin Hu.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.040
I haven't heard
of the name Lin Hu before.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.040
No.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.080
Back then, I was

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.440
focused on catching the scavenger.

00:11:00.479 --> 00:11:01.639
I fell into the water

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:02.999
and dragged you in with me.

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:04.519
Then accidentally...

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.879
Accidentally, I pulled your clothes

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.239
right off.

00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:09.800
Y-You don't remember now.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.160
Alright, enough.

00:11:12.479 --> 00:11:13.359
Stop talking.

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:15.080
Wait, there's more...

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.040
That was our

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.440
first encounter.

00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:18.960
You were on that street.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.320
Because of your handsome looks,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.119
the Nascent Soul Elder

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.800
tried to harass you publicly.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.840
If you can't recall, let it be.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.560
No need to be so harsh.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.960
Nonsense.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.080
I...

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.080
I was telling the truth.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.359
It seems my falling in water

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.800
still can't make Huan Zong

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.840
remember me.

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:56.359
I need another plan.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:58.320
Something bolder and grander,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.840
which will force Huan Zong

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:01.160
to remember me.

00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:05.119
Guess the palace

00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:06.639
doesn't have those things.

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.080
To make you feel

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.759
the same stab in the back

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:30.680
you did at Yuanji Sect,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.680
I have to do this.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.840
Blame imperial palace

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.359
for lacking real toxins.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.320
What're you doing here?

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.239
Nothing.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.359
I did nothing.

00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:45.759
Nothing.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.239
Nothing?

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.719
I really don't understand

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:06.399
what Father was thinking.

00:13:06.599 --> 00:13:08.359
Why did he send you here?

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.920
Even if you wanted to harm me,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.719
couldn't you use some brains?

00:13:12.119 --> 00:13:13.119
A foot-dead goldfish pond

00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:14.160
to drown me?

00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:15.479
Fingernail-sized

00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:16.160
rose thorns

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.080
to stab me?

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.119
I've never seen

00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:19.840
a spy as inept as you.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.879
Right?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.160
I told you

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.560
I'm not a spy.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:24.800
I said you're inept,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.200
not that you're not a spy.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.560
Had you trusted me,

00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:28.359
I wouldn't need

00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:29.479
to make all these messes.

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:31.280
That wooden head of yours

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:33.040
never gains wisdom.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.680
Now it's my fault?

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.920
Of course!

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.920
It's all your fault.

00:13:38.119 --> 00:13:38.879
But

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:40.399
you did protect me

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:41.440
and got injured.

00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:43.560
So I'll

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.920
let it slide.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.960
Alright.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.320
I'm swamped with duties.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.840
I have no time for your games.

00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:52.479
Keep quiet

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.800
and work in the stables.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.879
You don't trust me anyway.

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:57.200
Anywhere is the same.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.119
The stables...

00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:01.800
What? Stables?

00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:11.519
From now on,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.080
you'll manage this place alone.

00:14:14.239 --> 00:14:15.440
By myself?

00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:17.639
S-Such a...

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.879
From now on,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.200
let's get along well.

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:33.359
Tell me.

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:36.560
Huan Zong's too cruel to me.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.920
He abandoned me alone

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.680
in this filthy stable.

00:14:41.239 --> 00:14:42.759
Oh, horse.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.639
Tell me.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.960
How on earth

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:47.080
can I make him remember me?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.320
Now, he doesn't

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:50.599
show me any kindness.

00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:52.440
I can't

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.119
let this continue.

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.239
Why won't even you talk to me?

00:14:58.359 --> 00:14:59.080
You

00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:00.879
are just like Huan Zong.

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:02.160
You are heartless

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.239
and have a poor memory.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.920
Stable hand.

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:16.599
Go feed my horse.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.680
When it clears up,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.920
give it proper grooming.

00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:21.280
This horse is magnificently sturdy.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.399
It looks extraordinary.

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:23.599
Where did Huan Zong get it?

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:24.280
It's a gift

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.599
from his colleague.

00:15:25.719 --> 00:15:26.519
But why

00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:27.239
would they

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:28.399
gift the Second Prince?

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.879
Don't meddle in his affairs.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.999
Just tend to this horse properly.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.800
Here.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.999
Besides basic care,

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:44.359
she sometimes argues with horses,

00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:45.119
and even

00:15:45.239 --> 00:15:46.800
decorated your favorite horse

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.040
with ornaments.

00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:55.519
Tell me.

00:15:55.599 --> 00:15:57.160
Why is she doing

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.719
all these absurd things?

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.479
Your Highness, please enlighten me.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.359
I can't figure it out.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.320
The crucial point is
her nonsensical claims

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.280
sound oddly plausible.

00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:10.800
Your Highness,

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.560
having served you for years,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.399
I've never seen

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:14.280
someone so bizarre.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.440
Could her words be true?

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.560
Tell me.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.359
Since awakening from my coma,

00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:26.639
have I ever experienced

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.680
memory lapses

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.080
regarding past events?

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.119
Your Highness,

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:34.080
I've been by your side since childhood.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.800
If you truly couldn't remember

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.440
past occurrences,

00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:39.200
how would you still recognize me?

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.359
You're the new maid

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.720
managing stables

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.480
for my brother?

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.560
Your brother?

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.439
Who are you?

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.240
Presumptuous!

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.320
You dare not bow to the Crown Prince?

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.599
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.159
I heard my brother

00:17:29.159 --> 00:17:30.760
acquired a fine horse.

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:31.520
Where is it?

00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:32.959
I want to ride it.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.359
Make it gallop.

00:17:36.879 --> 00:17:38.280
Make it gallop.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.000
Faster! Faster!

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:41.280
Faster!

00:17:41.599 --> 00:17:42.480
Your Highness,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.439
this horse is new here

00:17:43.439 --> 00:17:44.879
and unaccustomed to this place.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.320
Faster! Faster!

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.199
Your Highness,

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:48.560
the horse remains untamed.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.879
Ride with caution.

00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:53.560
I dropped something.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:54.800
Help me dismount.

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:57.840
Slow down, Your Highness.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.439
My brother give it to me before.

00:18:06.199 --> 00:18:07.520
Please stop crying.

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:08.359
Such distress

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:09.560
harms your health.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.000
My brother give it to me before.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.639
It's merely a dough figurine.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.760
Stop crying.

00:18:16.879 --> 00:18:17.679
Alright. It's okay.

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.040
No more tears!

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.720
(Would Huan Zong be as lively)

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:39.840
(and adorable as him)

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.000
(when he was a kid?)

00:18:41.639 --> 00:18:43.119
(But why has he)

00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:43.919
(become so...)

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.520
Tell me

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.480
your other desires.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.720
I can craft anything for you.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.959
If you can imagine it,

00:18:52.959 --> 00:18:54.439
I can shape it.

00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:56.959
Really?

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:57.919
Yes.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.199
Then I want...

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.760
I...

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.840
Whatever I want,

00:19:07.959 --> 00:19:09.760
it won't be the same one anymore.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.080
That's easy.

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:11.879
You can ask Huan...

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.599
You can ask the Second Prince

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.919
to shape you a new one,

00:19:14.919 --> 00:19:15.480
right?

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.040
After Mother passed away,

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.320
my brother became well-occupied.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.040
No one ever plays with me normally.

00:19:25.119 --> 00:19:27.919
The eunuchs and bodyguards around me

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:30.359
only repeat these phrases.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.040
Be careful, Your Highness.

00:19:32.159 --> 00:19:33.480
Don't cry, Your Highness.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.199
How utterly tedious.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:41.879
How about this?

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:43.119
Just tell me

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.959
what you want to eat

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:46.359
and what you want to play.

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:46.919
I

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:49.159
will make sure to fulfill them all.

00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:50.240
Really?

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:51.080
Yes.

00:19:58.959 --> 00:20:00.399
What happened next?

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.040
Did Master Zhong Xi catch that beast?

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.280
Of course, he did.

00:20:04.439 --> 00:20:05.560
Master Zhong Xi

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.679
thrust his sword at the beast.

00:20:16.919 --> 00:20:18.000
What's going on?

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.159
Let me down!

00:20:19.159 --> 00:20:20.520
Your Highness, stay calm.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.199
Brother! Brother!

00:20:21.199 --> 00:20:22.439
I won't let you get hurt.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.639
Brother! Brother!

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.520
Your Highness! Someone!

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.439
Is the Crown Prince injured?

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.080
Your Highness, please rest assured.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.520
His Highness merely suffered shock.

00:20:49.679 --> 00:20:51.199
No physical harm done.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.919
He'll awaken after some rest.

00:20:54.199 --> 00:20:54.919
You may leave.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:55.679
Understood.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.240
Your Highness,

00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:20.199
the spy has been awake.

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:48.760
Huan Zong.

00:21:49.399 --> 00:21:50.959
What is this place?

00:21:51.199 --> 00:21:52.439
Do you know

00:21:52.639 --> 00:21:54.080
why you're here?

00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:55.320
I...

00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:57.199
I seemed

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.560
to take your brother horseback riding.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.679
Then the horse got spooked

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.800
and went wild suddenly,

00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:06.560
throwing us both off.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.359
Your brother, the Crown Prince...

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.879
Is he alright?

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.080
Was he injured?

00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:12.800
You tell me.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.480
Do you wish him injured or not?

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.639
I don't understand.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.639
What are you implying?

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:30.000
You don't understand?

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.760
Did my father send you here?

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.560
After merely

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.520
ignoring you for a few days,

00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:44.560
you couldn't wait anymore?

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.639
Huan Zong, please listen.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.639
There must be

00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:49.159
some misunderstanding here.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.399
Misunderstanding?

00:22:52.879 --> 00:22:54.240
If you have schemes,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.879
direct them at me.

00:22:56.399 --> 00:22:58.439
Why are you targeting a child?

00:22:58.959 --> 00:23:00.240
He's only six.

00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:03.000
He needs coaxing to finish meals,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.639
and cries from nightmares.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.760
How could you hurt him?

00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:08.679
How could I do that?

00:23:09.199 --> 00:23:10.080
I didn't.

00:23:10.199 --> 00:23:11.480
How could I harm him?

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.879
I-I'm truly didn't.

00:23:12.919 --> 00:23:14.399
Stop pretending.

00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:16.399
I'll say it one last time.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.199
If you have schemes in the future,

00:23:19.199 --> 00:23:20.280
direct them at me.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.720
Touch my brother again,

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.840
and I'll make sure you leave no remains.

00:23:23.959 --> 00:23:24.840
Huan Zong,

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.639
I meant no harm.

00:23:28.679 --> 00:23:29.919
Trust me.

00:23:29.959 --> 00:23:30.679
Not talking?

00:23:35.959 --> 00:23:37.720
You do have some backbone.

00:23:38.679 --> 00:23:39.480
Fine.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.480
Bei Jun.

00:23:51.959 --> 00:23:52.720
Huan Zong,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.320
what're you doing?

00:23:57.439 --> 00:23:59.439
What are you doing? Let me go.

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:02.520
I never harm women.

00:24:02.639 --> 00:24:03.359
But first,

00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:04.919
she can't harm my family.

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:06.599
I didn't.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.119
I swear it wasn't me.

00:24:08.199 --> 00:24:10.240
Growing up in the imperial palace,

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.800
I learned one fundamental truth.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.359
Words spoken too easily

00:24:15.199 --> 00:24:16.199
should never be trusted.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.399
I'm truly not a spy.

00:24:18.399 --> 00:24:19.359
Trust me.

00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:20.119
Bei Jun,

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.040
choose something you can wield.

00:24:25.199 --> 00:24:26.240
What are you trying to do?

00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:27.359
Huan Zong,

00:24:27.439 --> 00:24:29.080
I would never harm your brother.

00:24:34.879 --> 00:24:37.000
I'd advise you to stop holding out.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.599
Since you've already decided

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.040
I'm a spy sent by your father,

00:24:41.199 --> 00:24:43.399
why bother interrogating me?

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.599
Don't worry.

00:24:44.919 --> 00:24:46.320
I won't kill you now.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.639
It's not the time yet.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.879
But I can make you suffer.

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:52.639
Let him watch helplessly.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.080
That would be great.

00:24:55.639 --> 00:24:57.159
Instead of wasting time,

00:24:57.639 --> 00:24:58.760
you should

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.359
investigate

00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.320
why that horse

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.480
suddenly went mad.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.560
Take her elsewhere to cool off.

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:09.639
When the time comes, think carefully

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.159
before speaking to me.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.080
If I'm feeling generous,

00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:15.560
I might grant you an intact corpse.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.119
What will make you believe me?

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:28.919
If my father asks

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:30.879
how you met your end,

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.919
I'll first feign grief.

00:25:32.959 --> 00:25:34.480
I learned it from you.

00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:36.599
Then I'll tell him you stumbled
into the dungeon.

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:38.159
Servants tried to find you but failed.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.560
When they found you,

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:41.320
you were already lifeless.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.520
Stay here.

00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:46.159
Huan Zong.

00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:48.000
Huan Zong.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:16.840
Bei Jun,

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.760
kill that maddened horse.

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:21.639
Have a coroner examine it thoroughly.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.399
Understood.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.439
So cold.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.879
Huan Zong.

00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:51.599
It's freezing here.

00:26:52.439 --> 00:26:54.080
It's truly freezing here.

00:26:55.199 --> 00:26:56.879
Let me out.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.119
No.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.679
If I use my spiritual energy now,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.560
all previous efforts will be wasted.

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:47.560
I can't do this.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.439
No.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.240
I need to find another way.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.919
I need to calm down.

00:27:55.119 --> 00:27:56.480
I need to calm down.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.760
Think of a way.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.320
Huan Zong,

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.080
I will get you out of here.

00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:05.080
Think again.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.119
Find another way.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Huan Zong.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.399
Brother.

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:04.040
Brother.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.399
The Crown Prince is awake!

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.879
Truly Heaven's blessing.

00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:08.119
Heaven's blessing.

00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:09.040
Brother.

00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:09.879
Get the physician.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:10.720
Yes.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:12.919
How do you feel?

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.720
Brother.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.040
The Crown Prince is out of danger.

00:29:20.119 --> 00:29:21.119
I will prescribe

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.240
some calming herbs

00:29:22.399 --> 00:29:23.679
for His Highness.

00:29:27.439 --> 00:29:29.520
Hush. You've just awakened.

00:29:30.919 --> 00:29:32.280
Any other instructions?

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.399
His Highness is young
and impressionable.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.280
But his constitution
ensures swift recovery.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.919
I take my leave.

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.320
Brother,

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.399
the physician said I'm fine.

00:29:49.399 --> 00:29:50.800
I'm truly fine.

00:29:50.879 --> 00:29:51.639
Alright.

00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:53.480
Rest a while longer.

00:30:00.199 --> 00:30:01.240
Do you remember

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.560
what happened back then?

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.520
Everything was normal at first.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.520
Then the horse suddenly went mad.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.439
Oh, right.

00:30:12.639 --> 00:30:13.800
How is that

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.919
palace maid now?

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.320
The palace maid?

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:17.959
Yes.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.199
The horse suddenly went mad

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.000
and tried to throw us off.

00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:23.480
It couldn't be stopped at all.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.000
When we fell down,

00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:27.840
it was that palace maid

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:29.679
who shielded me with her body.

00:30:30.199 --> 00:30:31.639
She saved me.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.879
If not for her,

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.159
I might have been injured.

00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:37.560
That palace maid saved you?

00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:40.439
Brother,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.599
where is that palace maid

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:42.639
right now?

00:30:42.679 --> 00:30:43.679
How is she?

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.280
Is she injured?

00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:49.720
Your Highness,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.679
the coroner is here.

00:30:51.439 --> 00:30:52.199
Got it.

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:54.800
Your Highness,

00:30:55.199 --> 00:30:56.040
this is what I found

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.320
in the stomach of that spooked

00:30:57.399 --> 00:30:57.899
horse.

00:30:58.199 --> 00:30:59.199
Any abnormalities?

00:30:59.240 --> 00:30:59.840
Yes.

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:01.560
This is a poisonous herb

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.599
called Bell Grass.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.879
When animals consume it,

00:31:03.879 --> 00:31:04.760
they go mad.

00:31:10.359 --> 00:31:12.199
But this grass has a peculiar trait.

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:13.760
Horses don't show symptoms

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.159
right after eating it.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.000
It won't act

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.199
until seven to ten days later,

00:31:17.199 --> 00:31:19.080
after it's fully absorbed

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:19.879
by the body.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.480
Seven to ten days?

00:31:21.639 --> 00:31:22.320
Are you sure?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.439
Yes, I am.

00:31:23.879 --> 00:31:24.760
Based on the state

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.199
of this grass in the horse stomach,

00:31:26.439 --> 00:31:27.720
it had been present

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.959
about seven to ten days.

00:31:29.599 --> 00:31:30.240
Your Highness,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.240
you scheduled

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.240
to ride it tomorrow

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:33.280
to meet Duke Ning

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.439
and other officials.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:37.959
You may leave.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.399
Bei Jun,

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.040
how long has Kong Hou
been at the stables?

00:31:48.199 --> 00:31:49.439
You only sent her there

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.720
two days ago.

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:52.639
That decision

00:31:52.639 --> 00:31:53.959
was impulsive.

00:31:54.599 --> 00:31:56.320
Only two days have passed,

00:31:58.599 --> 00:32:00.119
yet the poison grass...

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.439
It seems I've wronged her.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.720
Once I get him out of here,

00:32:10.879 --> 00:32:11.760
everything

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:14.119
will be alright.

00:32:22.599 --> 00:32:23.320
Wake up.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.679
Huan Zong.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.879
Huan Zong,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.560
trust me.

00:32:34.199 --> 00:32:36.480
I truly never intended to harm you

00:32:37.199 --> 00:32:39.679
or your brother.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.720
I know.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.359
Truly.

00:32:43.359 --> 00:32:44.599
I wrongfully accused you.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.359
Trust me.

00:33:01.199 --> 00:33:02.280
What's going on?

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.320
Huan Zong.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.000
Huan Zong, what's wrong?

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.399
What is this?

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.879
What's happening, Huan Zong?

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:33.199
Huan Zong.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.119
Let's get out first.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.159
Leave this place.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.040
What are you doing?

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.000
Digging a tunnel.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.280
Why dig a tunnel?

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.320
To escape, obviously.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:58.840
You fool.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.040
You think locking me up...

00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:11.800
Never again.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.879
Trying to imprison me?

00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:24.720
Haven't measured your own worth?

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.919
Running quite fast.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.039
Care for another round?

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.479
Be careful.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.999
Wait, hold on.

00:34:40.999 --> 00:34:42.559
W-What are you doing?

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:43.079
Look.

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:44.479
Sending you on your final journey.

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.320
Final journey?

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.999
Where to?

00:34:46.999 --> 00:34:49.160
To lush pastures

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.359
where you'll surely become

00:34:50.439 --> 00:34:51.800
enlightened souls

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.959
free from wicked desires.

00:34:55.439 --> 00:34:56.359
Isn't that

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:58.240
sending us to the underworld?

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.079
I don't want to die.

00:34:59.079 --> 00:34:59.840
Brother,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.879
I don't want to die!

00:35:01.039 --> 00:35:02.399
Shut up! Stop crying!

00:35:02.479 --> 00:35:04.079
We both serve the Lord.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.439
If he dares hurt us,

00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:06.959
the Lord will never spare him.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.079
I don't care who that Lord is

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.959
or whether he will spare me.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.680
You won't live to see it anyway.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.600
I can redeem myself right now.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.399
Shut your mouth!

00:35:16.399 --> 00:35:17.280
I can still contribute

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.439
a lot to Lingyou Realm.

00:35:18.439 --> 00:35:19.479
Don't kill me!

00:35:19.479 --> 00:35:20.399
That was quick.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.720
Listen well.

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:24.600
Take these two back.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.840
If they cause any trouble on the way,

00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:28.559
execute them on the spot.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:29.999
Let's go.

00:35:29.999 --> 00:35:30.959
As long as you spare us,

00:35:30.959 --> 00:35:31.720
we'll do anything.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.840
Of course. Anything.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.320
Huan Zong.

00:35:45.879 --> 00:35:46.600
Huan Zong.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.640
Huan Zong.

00:35:50.359 --> 00:35:51.039
Huan Zong.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:56.999
Huan Zong.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.160
Huan Zong.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720
Huan Zong.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.720
Huan Zong.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.120
It's really you.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.519
So

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.519
you've been by my side all along.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.039
Am I dreaming?

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.720
Huan Zong.

00:36:28.928 --> 00:36:32.255
♪Dreams are fleeting and brief♪

00:36:33.344 --> 00:36:36.347
♪Fade like a poem♪

00:36:38.919 --> 00:36:40.320
Your Highness, medicine is ready.

00:36:40.919 --> 00:36:41.999
Leave it. I'll handle it.

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:42.680
Yes.

My lady, you're awake.

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:37.640
Come on. Take it slowly.

00:37:43.479 --> 00:37:45.999
How long was I asleep?

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.320
Three days already.

00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:48.320
We all thought you'd

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:48.879
never wake up.

00:37:48.879 --> 00:37:49.800
Three days?

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:53.399
Huan Zong.

00:37:53.919 --> 00:37:55.079
Trust me.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.999
I-I truly never intended to harm you

00:37:58.879 --> 00:38:00.840
or your brother.

00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:01.879
I know.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.600
I wrongfully accused you.

00:38:06.399 --> 00:38:08.399
The Second Prince
asks about you every day.

00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:11.160
Thankfully...

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.720
He comes every day to ask about me?

00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:18.959
Could it be

00:38:19.479 --> 00:38:21.120
he's remembering me?

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.280
My lady, you still have a fever.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:25.879
- I'm fine.
- You still...

00:38:25.879 --> 00:38:26.600
I'm fine.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.320
Huan Zong,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.999
I was just about to look for you.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.079
Three days of fever.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.559
I thought you might never wake up.

00:38:43.039 --> 00:38:44.519
Yet here you walk barefoot.

00:38:44.959 --> 00:38:45.959
You've fully recovered?

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.720
Huan Zong,

00:38:46.959 --> 00:38:48.479
did you come to see me

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.959
because you have remembered me?

00:38:50.039 --> 00:38:50.919
Right?

00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:54.359
No.

00:38:55.959 --> 00:38:56.919
But I'm certain now

00:38:56.919 --> 00:38:57.919
that the incident had

00:38:57.919 --> 00:38:58.840
nothing to do with you.

00:39:03.079 --> 00:39:04.120
True enough.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.240
If you had remembered me,

00:39:06.919 --> 00:39:08.919
you wouldn't have locked me
in the ice cave

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.320
and treated me so cruelly.

00:39:11.879 --> 00:39:13.359
Do your injuries still pain you?

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.079
It hurts. How could it not?

00:39:16.879 --> 00:39:19.120
Though this is the inner demon realm,

00:39:19.479 --> 00:39:20.479
it still

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.840
hurts badly.

00:39:22.919 --> 00:39:24.240
Every part of me aches.

00:39:26.359 --> 00:39:27.720
I misunderstood you.

00:39:27.959 --> 00:39:28.760
I'm sorry.

00:39:29.439 --> 00:39:30.999
Is that all?

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.120
I

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.999
can make amends.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.879
My lady,

00:39:38.039 --> 00:39:39.519
His Highness had the imperial kitchen

00:39:39.519 --> 00:39:40.640
prepare this tonic meal.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.640
Please dine.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.160
Come on.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.399
Take your time.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.160
He didn't investigate properly

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.280
before resorting to torture.

00:40:21.559 --> 00:40:22.439
He thinks he can

00:40:22.439 --> 00:40:23.879
dismiss me with a single meal?

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.640
Does he look down on me so easily?

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.240
Utterly ungrateful.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.640
Your Highness,

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.439
you barged into a lady's chamber
so casually.

00:40:51.479 --> 00:40:52.600
Don't you know the propriety

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.399
between genders?

00:40:54.559 --> 00:40:55.919
I'm here

00:40:56.399 --> 00:40:57.439
to find out how this

00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.919
can be settled?

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.280
Your Highness,

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.399
you speak too lightly.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.919
You slap someone,

00:41:02.999 --> 00:41:04.280
and then offer a sweet favor.

00:41:04.519 --> 00:41:06.039
Do you expect them

00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:08.079
to eagerly present their cheek again

00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:09.120
for another slap?

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.800
Don't be so ungrateful.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.999
I've always believed

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.519
that sincerity and understanding

00:41:19.559 --> 00:41:20.760
must be mutual.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.479
If Your Highness

00:41:22.479 --> 00:41:23.640
truly carries remorse,

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.160
I would have sensed it already.

00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:27.760
Yet now, I feel nothing.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.399
Your Highness,

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:30.720
please take your leave.

00:41:35.999 --> 00:41:37.079
What are you doing?

00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:39.280
Then just wait and see

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.479
my sincerity.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.359
Let it begin.

00:41:53.399 --> 00:41:54.320
You do it.

00:41:54.439 --> 00:41:55.800
No, you do it.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.280
- No.
- You do it.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.359
- You can do it.
- You do it.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.720
Why the hesitation?

00:42:04.439 --> 00:42:05.479
Bei Jun, you'd do it.

00:42:07.079 --> 00:42:07.840
Your Highness,

00:42:08.479 --> 00:42:09.359
should I truly strike?

00:42:09.959 --> 00:42:11.079
Do it.
