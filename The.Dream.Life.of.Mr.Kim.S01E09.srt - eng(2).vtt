THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:49.488
Sir, everything's fine.

00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:52.866
Slowly, take a deep breath.

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:53.992
What are you talking about?

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:56.912
The subway construction
has been postponed for ages.

00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:59.164
I heard they flipped 300-million-won units

00:00:59.247 --> 00:01:00.582
for over a billion won.

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.460
Not sure how to say this.
I don't think I can open the shop.

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.545
Right. You don't need to
return the deposit.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:06.922
Goodbye then.

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:10.258
Don't you dare touch
your severance pay. Just leave it be.

00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:12.886
If you do something
you're not cut out for,

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.680
it'll only come back to bite you.

00:01:22.437 --> 00:01:24.106
-Make way!
-Everyone, please move!

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.024
What's going on?

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:30.779
How are you feeling?

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:33.824
-Better than before.
-When is your family coming?

00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:36.118
I didn't contact anyone.

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.578
Shouldn't you?
Can you get home by yourself?

00:01:38.662 --> 00:01:40.080
Yes, I'll be fine,

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:43.417
but my heart suddenly started racing,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.045
and it felt like something
was pressing down on my chest.

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:49.881
Do I have arrhythmia or something?

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:52.175
No, all your test results look normal.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.762
Your blood work and scans
show no physical issues.

00:01:58.223 --> 00:01:59.808
These appear to be panic symptoms.

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:01.893
Have you been under stress lately?

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:02.936
Excuse me?

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:04.438
Was it the first time?

00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:07.441
Or have you experienced
similar symptoms before?

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:11.903
Have a great life, Nak-su!

00:02:11.987 --> 00:02:13.739
Then why did they do that to him?

00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:14.906
Nak-su!

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:17.123
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:18.910
-I'm sorry.
-You might as well be the errand boy.

00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:20.787
What else would you do?

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:28.170
You should see a psychiatrist tomorrow.

00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:33.258
-A psychiatrist?
-Should I set up an appointment for you?

00:02:35.594 --> 00:02:36.470
With a psychiatrist?

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:12.172
God, are you joking?

00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:15.091
I said I was having trouble breathing,

00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:17.552
and now you're treating me like a lunatic.

00:03:18.094 --> 00:03:19.888
Are you even a real doctor?

00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:21.056
Please lower your voice.

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:22.808
I can't believe this.

00:03:23.683 --> 00:03:25.894
Seriously, you're treating me
like I'm crazy.

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:27.312
Damn it.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:54.506
Loafer.

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.216
-You idiot!
-Gosh!

00:04:00.512 --> 00:04:01.429
Loafer.

00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:04.558
How much was it again?

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:06.184
It was 1.05 billion won.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.603
How much is the loan?

00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:09.563
It's 550 million won.

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:11.898
-You moron!
-Don't. You hit me earlier.

00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:15.735
Does your wife know?

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:16.903
Not yet.

00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:20.407
Who makes a decision like this
without talking to their wife?

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.577
I wanted to give her a big surprise
once a franchise moved in.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.913
That's crazy.
Why would anyone move in here?

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.166
I told you not to touch
the severance pay!

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.585
Damn it.

00:04:31.668 --> 00:04:33.795
You think it's easy to profit
from commercial buildings?

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.339
"To crush an enemy,
have them buy commercial property."

00:04:36.423 --> 00:04:38.216
There's a reason why people say that.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.219
If you had a bad feeling about it,
you should've tried harder to stop me.

00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:43.096
Want me to hit you "harder"?

00:04:43.972 --> 00:04:45.765
So no one will move in?

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.475
Oh my God.

00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:50.854
Just hold on. I'll look into it.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.774
Don't try to solve this on your own.

00:04:54.858 --> 00:04:55.942
Tell your wife ASAP.

00:04:57.152 --> 00:04:58.445
No way.

00:04:58.528 --> 00:05:01.740
-You have to. Or you're done for.
-No. Damn it.

00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:03.825
-I can't.
-Jeez.

00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:11.750
EPISODE 9
WORST ENEMY

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:23.887
What the heck?

00:05:26.348 --> 00:05:27.474
Honey.

00:05:28.892 --> 00:05:29.809
Hi.

00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:31.603
You forgot the code?

00:05:31.686 --> 00:05:32.854
No, that's not it.

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.273
Have you been drinking?

00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:37.192
Drinking? No, I just…

00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:40.487
Then what is it?
Is your memory getting worse?

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.197
I'm just getting old. That's all.

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:49.496
-Honey.
-Yes?

00:05:52.874 --> 00:05:54.334
I landed my first contract today.

00:05:55.794 --> 00:05:57.337
-You did?
-Isn't that amazing?

00:05:59.047 --> 00:06:01.049
Gosh. Really?

00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:02.092
That's great.

00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:04.094
-Come sit down.
-Okay.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.304
So,

00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:08.181
I made 60,000 won.

00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:11.267
Sixty thousand won?

00:06:11.351 --> 00:06:13.311
It was a studio with a low deposit.

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:15.689
The company took 60 percent, and I got 40.

00:06:16.982 --> 00:06:17.857
It's not much.

00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:21.611
What do you mean, it's not much?

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:23.738
You worked hard for that money.

00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:26.574
-Do you mean it?
-Of course.

00:06:26.658 --> 00:06:29.369
Should we frame it
and hang it up on the wall?

00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:32.497
Don't be so dramatic.

00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:35.792
Let's order fried chicken.

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:36.835
My treat.

00:06:38.253 --> 00:06:40.296
No, I'll pay.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.215
So what about you?

00:06:42.298 --> 00:06:43.174
What about me?

00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:45.760
You said you had something
to tell me this morning.

00:06:49.556 --> 00:06:51.016
It's just…

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:53.226
This is a big day.
You signed your first contract.

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:55.687
I'll tell you later.

00:06:56.688 --> 00:06:57.897
What should we get?

00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:01.359
The freshly-fried chicken.
That one's delicious.

00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:03.361
That was good. Okay.

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:05.864
Here, let me.

00:07:06.865 --> 00:07:10.201
Let's get the fried chicken,
add extra fries,

00:07:10.827 --> 00:07:13.038
and cheese. We have to add cheese too.

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:40.523
Jeez, where's Building 103…

00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:42.358
Excuse me, sir. Where is Building 103?

00:07:43.193 --> 00:07:45.070
Go that way and take a left.

00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:46.571
Okay. Thank you.

00:07:49.324 --> 00:07:51.284
Hi, I'm so sorry. I'm right out front.

00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:52.827
I'll be right there. Sorry.

00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:06.633
Honey, can you take out
the recycling later?

00:08:06.716 --> 00:08:09.385
I already sorted it,
so you just need to take it out, okay?

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:10.845
All right.

00:08:10.929 --> 00:08:12.180
-I'm leaving now.
-Okay.

00:08:12.263 --> 00:08:13.306
I'm off too.

00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:15.873
INCOMING CALL

00:08:16.184 --> 00:08:17.227
Hello?

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.854
This is the admin office
at Seonghyeon General Hospital.

00:08:19.938 --> 00:08:22.649
Is this Mr. Kim Nak-su,
who visited the ER yesterday afternoon?

00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:23.733
Yes, that's me.

00:08:23.817 --> 00:08:25.860
You left without paying your bill.

00:08:25.944 --> 00:08:28.071
Would you be able to come in
and pay it today?

00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:29.781
Yes, of course. Gosh.

00:08:32.826 --> 00:08:34.410
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:08:34.494 --> 00:08:37.163
That will be 218,000 won.
I can take your payment now.

00:08:39.249 --> 00:08:40.750
-Insert your card there.
-Okay.

00:08:42.544 --> 00:08:45.338
Will "emergency room"
appear on my statement?

00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:48.716
Yes, as "Seonghyeon General Hospital
Emergency Center."

00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:50.885
In that case,

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:52.804
I'll pay in cash.

00:09:07.277 --> 00:09:08.486
SAY BANK
DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:13.783
Monthly savings account
with only one deposit, 2.2 million.

00:09:13.867 --> 00:09:15.743
Salary account, 900,000.

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:20.790
High-interest account, 1.8 million.
And in my payment app,

00:09:20.874 --> 00:09:24.085
the money I have to pay right away…

00:09:27.964 --> 00:09:28.840
UPCOMING CARD PAYMENT

00:09:28.923 --> 00:09:31.134
HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS
WILL BE CHARGED…

00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:33.219
"Six hundred and thirty thousand…"

00:09:34.637 --> 00:09:36.347
HEALTH INSURANCE 630,600
TOTAL 299,930

00:09:40.602 --> 00:09:41.561
My

00:09:42.478 --> 00:09:44.314
entire life savings

00:09:44.939 --> 00:09:47.108
amounts to just 290,000 won.

00:09:49.569 --> 00:09:52.322
I can't even pay
the first month's interest on the loan.

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:56.201
Man.

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:07.587
Wait.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.546
STOCKS
20,035,800 WON

00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:10.465
Right.

00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:12.467
What about the deposit?

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.676
Twenty million.

00:10:14.302 --> 00:10:17.222
Why would they invent a lease
for a nonexistent toast shop

00:10:17.722 --> 00:10:20.183
just to give me 20 million won?

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:23.895
Maybe they needed to buy some time.

00:10:24.395 --> 00:10:26.147
Time to lower my guard,

00:10:26.231 --> 00:10:28.858
clear out the sales office,
and disappear.

00:10:28.942 --> 00:10:30.610
I'm making a call. Quiet down.

00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:34.781
-Hello?
-Hello, sir.

00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:36.157
I hope you've been well.

00:10:36.658 --> 00:10:38.993
I called because someone inquired
about signing a lease.

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:41.955
And they would have needed
a legal loophole too.

00:10:42.038 --> 00:10:45.333
Thank you so much. We'll do our very best.

00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.210
Not at all. I'm happy to have you.

00:10:47.293 --> 00:10:48.461
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

00:10:49.671 --> 00:10:51.297
-Looking forward to it.
-I am too.

00:10:51.381 --> 00:10:52.966
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:10:55.677 --> 00:10:57.637
Pleasure doing business with you.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.680
Thank you.

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:01.933
Damn it. This is all I get?
He gave you 1.05 billion.

00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:04.811
I'll buy you premium beef later, okay?

00:11:04.894 --> 00:11:07.939
What are you talking about?
We already signed the contract.

00:11:08.022 --> 00:11:11.567
Yes, I'm afraid I can't do it.
I'm very sorry.

00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:13.361
You can't just back out now--

00:11:13.444 --> 00:11:15.738
-He's being so annoying.
-Just hang up already.

00:11:15.822 --> 00:11:17.907
What about the deposit?

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.327
Right. You don't need
to return the deposit.

00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:23.079
Goodbye then.

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:26.624
If they forfeit the deposit,
it's not considered fraud.

00:11:26.708 --> 00:11:29.335
It just becomes a simple case
of the tenant changing their mind.

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:32.922
All right, everyone.
Give me your SIM cards.

00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:34.799
Give them to him.

00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:40.054
To the bastards who took
700 to 800 million won,

00:11:40.138 --> 00:11:41.848
the 20 million won they gave me…

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.768
Let's party!

00:11:48.104 --> 00:11:49.939
…was just
a cost-effective investment

00:11:50.023 --> 00:11:52.108
for the perfect crime.

00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:02.285
TOTAL 299,930 WON

00:12:20.303 --> 00:12:21.971
Damn it.

00:12:26.184 --> 00:12:27.226
Damn it!

00:12:28.728 --> 00:12:30.480
I think we're almost there.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.149
Are you sure you didn't take a wrong turn?

00:12:33.858 --> 00:12:36.277
-Let me see.
-I'll make this work to pay off my loan

00:12:36.361 --> 00:12:38.863
and pay back my dad as soon as possible.

00:12:41.324 --> 00:12:42.241
NO MORE BORING T-SHIRTS

00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:43.826
DESIGN YOUR OWN UNIQUE T-SHIRT

00:12:48.664 --> 00:12:51.000
-Welcome. We're having a sale.
-Hello.

00:12:51.084 --> 00:12:52.418
-Really?
-Take a look.

00:12:52.502 --> 00:12:53.669
Excuse us.

00:12:53.753 --> 00:12:55.338
-Han-na, let's go.
-What? Okay.

00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:56.672
-Feel free to come back.
-Okay.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.677
Wait. Can't we get the samples delivered

00:13:01.761 --> 00:13:03.763
and place the order by phone?

00:13:04.305 --> 00:13:07.183
I want to compare
different fabrics in person.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.395
And if we can,
we should negotiate the price.

00:13:10.478 --> 00:13:12.021
You know how to do that?

00:13:12.647 --> 00:13:15.066
Of course.
We have to save every penny we can.

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:16.943
After all, my dad helped us out.

00:13:17.026 --> 00:13:18.986
We have to be careful, no matter what.

00:13:21.989 --> 00:13:23.032
This is the place.

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:27.286
This fabric is incredible, isn't it?

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.287
It is.

00:13:29.414 --> 00:13:32.333
I still don't see
what's so incredible about it.

00:13:33.501 --> 00:13:36.921
Since the fabric is excellent,
and the printing came out really well,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.006
I'd like to place an order.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.091
What?

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:43.177
Was it 18,000 won per piece?

00:13:48.808 --> 00:13:51.686
We'll order 100 of each color,
for a total of 300 pieces.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.604
How does 16,000 won sound?

00:13:55.148 --> 00:13:57.650
If you order a thousand,
I can go as low as 10,000 won.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.404
-Did you say 10,000 won?
-That's right.

00:14:05.074 --> 00:14:07.660
Get a grip. Just order 300.

00:14:10.746 --> 00:14:12.832
If we buy a thousand at 10,000 won

00:14:12.915 --> 00:14:14.834
and sell them for just 30,000 won each,

00:14:16.002 --> 00:14:17.378
that's 30 million won.

00:14:17.462 --> 00:14:19.464
Then I can pay my dad back right away.

00:14:19.547 --> 00:14:22.300
That's true,
but that's only if these sell out.

00:14:27.138 --> 00:14:29.390
Han-na, let's just
bet on the holiday rush.

00:14:32.852 --> 00:14:34.604
See? It says, "Love lives here."

00:14:37.148 --> 00:14:40.276
I'm supposed to pack these with you
till the end of the year?

00:14:41.944 --> 00:14:43.279
If you don't want that,

00:14:43.863 --> 00:14:45.615
then we should sell them fast.

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:48.826
All right, sir.

00:14:49.827 --> 00:14:52.455
Four hundred of each color.
A total of 1,200.

00:14:53.414 --> 00:14:54.415
It's a deal.

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.043
Thank you.

00:14:57.126 --> 00:15:00.004
What a good son. You get a five percent
discount with a bank transfer.

00:15:00.087 --> 00:15:02.173
-Did you tell her?
-No.

00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:03.716
Want me to tell her?

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:06.928
"Ha-jin, your husband is a landlord now."

00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:09.222
"But you know that building is--"

00:15:09.305 --> 00:15:12.391
Gosh, I said I would talk
to her today.

00:15:13.893 --> 00:15:14.977
I have to go.

00:15:22.693 --> 00:15:24.695
-Mr. Kim Nak-su.
-Hey.

00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:27.657
When someone comes home,
at least say hello.

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:30.826
Hello.

00:15:36.082 --> 00:15:39.710
Putting these in the washing machine
must be so hard, right?

00:15:40.753 --> 00:15:41.629
Sorry.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.841
Just kidding.

00:15:47.218 --> 00:15:48.386
I landed two contracts today.

00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:50.930
So, 120,000 won?

00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:52.598
It's 90,000 won.

00:15:54.517 --> 00:15:56.477
Then let's get pizza.

00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:58.187
You order tonight.

00:15:59.647 --> 00:16:00.648
What's gotten into you?

00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:01.607
What do you mean?

00:16:02.942 --> 00:16:04.569
I mean…

00:16:04.652 --> 00:16:07.196
You've been acting so weird
since yesterday.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.699
-How?
-Normally, you would say,

00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:11.659
"Sweating all day for just 90,000 won?"

00:16:11.742 --> 00:16:13.953
"That doesn't even cover the bus fare!"

00:16:14.787 --> 00:16:16.122
Are you sick?

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:20.209
My stomach hurts.

00:16:20.293 --> 00:16:22.003
What if you earn more than I do?

00:16:22.086 --> 00:16:23.921
I'm so jealous it hurts.

00:16:25.047 --> 00:16:26.048
My stomach.

00:16:26.132 --> 00:16:28.509
Don't try to change the subject.

00:16:28.593 --> 00:16:29.677
What is it?

00:16:35.057 --> 00:16:35.933
Well, it's just…

00:16:44.108 --> 00:16:45.651
What is it?

00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:49.614
Gosh, I can never fool you.

00:16:57.872 --> 00:17:00.499
I was thinking of meeting Sang-cheol.

00:17:02.293 --> 00:17:04.879
Why? I thought you didn't want

00:17:04.962 --> 00:17:06.380
to join his company.

00:17:06.464 --> 00:17:08.841
No, I've been thinking about it.

00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:12.261
With sales,
you're bound to struggle at first.

00:17:12.345 --> 00:17:14.555
So I figured I'd join
when they're starting out

00:17:14.639 --> 00:17:17.475
and help give him some direction.

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:24.106
-Are you sure you'll be okay?
-Why wouldn't I be okay? We're family.

00:17:36.494 --> 00:17:37.828
ENERGY DRINK

00:17:37.912 --> 00:17:39.580
Why is this so expensive?

00:17:52.551 --> 00:17:54.345
-That'll be 8,800 won.
-Okay.

00:17:54.428 --> 00:17:56.055
Do you have a mobile carrier discount?

00:17:57.139 --> 00:17:59.016
Sorry, ACT doesn't get a discount.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.685
-Sorry about that.
-I see.

00:18:01.936 --> 00:18:03.396
Do you need a plastic bag?

00:18:03.479 --> 00:18:04.355
100 WON A BAG

00:18:05.356 --> 00:18:07.316
Oh, there's a charge for it? No, thanks.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.275
-Okay.
-Here.

00:18:32.007 --> 00:18:35.344
This is… It's very responsive.

00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:39.515
You're a bit too late, Nak-su.

00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:41.392
I probably am.

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:43.436
It keeps disconnecting.

00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:44.603
I'll look into it further.

00:18:44.687 --> 00:18:45.813
-Take it.
-Yes, sir.

00:18:48.899 --> 00:18:51.110
I've mentioned before.

00:18:51.193 --> 00:18:52.111
Look over there.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.741
We already have a sales director.

00:18:56.824 --> 00:18:59.076
-I see.
-We've also hired staff under them.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.538
We don't have any more openings
in the sales department.

00:19:02.621 --> 00:19:03.664
Hey.

00:19:03.748 --> 00:19:05.666
-Hi, Ha-yeong.
-Nak-su, you're here.

00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:09.003
Mr. Han, Director Moon
from Nemo Telecom is almost here.

00:19:10.129 --> 00:19:11.338
Really? What should I do?

00:19:12.006 --> 00:19:14.383
Ms. Park, could you take care of him

00:19:14.467 --> 00:19:15.968
for a moment?

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.888
Nak-su, I'll be right back.

00:19:18.971 --> 00:19:20.806
-Take one with you.
-No, I'm fine.

00:19:37.114 --> 00:19:39.074
It feels like I'm interviewing you.

00:19:40.451 --> 00:19:41.327
HAN SANG-CHEOL

00:19:41.452 --> 00:19:42.453
Introduce yourself.

00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:46.749
What is it that you do here?

00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:49.335
I'm a registered director at this company.

00:19:49.418 --> 00:19:52.713
I brought my enzyme group-buying
business here and made us a nice profit.

00:19:52.797 --> 00:19:54.632
I had no idea.

00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.470
You should have come sooner.

00:20:00.346 --> 00:20:01.806
I know.

00:20:03.182 --> 00:20:05.935
Nak-su, even if we wanted
to work with you,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.728
we're fully staffed.

00:20:08.395 --> 00:20:11.524
I'm not kidding.
There's literally no desk left for you.

00:20:14.109 --> 00:20:16.904
Sales is about hitting the pavement.

00:20:17.988 --> 00:20:19.865
Things like that don't really matter.

00:20:20.658 --> 00:20:22.117
A desk is just a desk.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.296
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

00:20:35.047 --> 00:20:36.924
-Just a moment.
-Sure.

00:20:38.092 --> 00:20:40.261
-Excuse me.
-Yes, of course.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.055
Sorry,
I'll send it myself now.

00:20:44.974 --> 00:20:46.934
Gosh, let me.

00:20:47.643 --> 00:20:50.354
This is really hard to watch, Nak-su.

00:20:50.437 --> 00:20:51.522
No, I'm fine.

00:20:51.605 --> 00:20:53.440
I'm getting to know how things work here.

00:20:53.524 --> 00:20:55.442
Sure. Take a few days to observe

00:20:55.526 --> 00:20:58.070
and think if there's anything
for you to do here.

00:20:58.153 --> 00:20:59.780
Okay.

00:20:59.864 --> 00:21:02.491
If you have any questions
about sales, feel free to ask.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.497
Can I help you with that?

00:21:08.581 --> 00:21:09.957
-Yes. Thank you.
-The ink--

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.543
Sorry. Can you
send this by courier for me?

00:21:12.626 --> 00:21:14.086
-By courier?
-Here's the address.

00:21:14.169 --> 00:21:15.504
-Thank you.
-I have one too.

00:21:15.588 --> 00:21:16.547
What?

00:21:17.172 --> 00:21:18.465
-A courier?
-Me too.

00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:20.175
Okay.

00:21:21.093 --> 00:21:22.678
-Thank you so much.
-Okay, then.

00:21:24.388 --> 00:21:25.264
A courier…

00:21:30.102 --> 00:21:32.521
MANGJIN PLAZA

00:21:32.605 --> 00:21:35.399
MANGJIN PLAZA SALES OFFICE

00:21:35.482 --> 00:21:37.693
JUNGYEONG REAL ESTATE

00:21:54.126 --> 00:21:55.252
Hey, who's here?

00:21:55.336 --> 00:21:56.962
Come sit down.

00:22:00.174 --> 00:22:01.926
-Hi, Dad.
-Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:03.594
What brings you two here?

00:22:03.677 --> 00:22:05.721
Go take a look at Su-gyeom's room.

00:22:05.804 --> 00:22:07.723
-Just go have a look.
-What?

00:22:08.349 --> 00:22:10.517
Oh my gosh. What is all that?

00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:12.061
Don't ask me.

00:22:12.144 --> 00:22:14.104
Why don't you ask your son?

00:22:15.689 --> 00:22:16.565
What is all that?

00:22:16.649 --> 00:22:18.567
Some clothes we had made.

00:22:18.651 --> 00:22:20.194
-Clothes?
-Yes.

00:22:20.277 --> 00:22:23.322
We're going to try
to sell these hoodies online.

00:22:23.405 --> 00:22:25.449
So how many did you get?

00:22:26.325 --> 00:22:28.118
It's 1,200 pieces total.

00:22:28.202 --> 00:22:30.454
-One thousand and two hundred?
-Yes.

00:22:30.537 --> 00:22:32.748
I tried to talk him out of it,

00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:35.918
but your son was just so determined.

00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:38.170
Wait, with what money?

00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:41.507
When we were struggling, Mr. Kim helped--

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.884
We got funding.

00:22:43.968 --> 00:22:46.887
-What?
-I helped him out a little.

00:22:46.971 --> 00:22:50.265
With the business proposal and all.
I can whip those up in a flash.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.187
-Are you feeling okay?
-What?

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.856
Or are you hiding something?

00:22:58.816 --> 00:23:01.110
You've been acting so strange lately.

00:23:01.193 --> 00:23:04.405
You're starting
to make me a little nervous.

00:23:04.488 --> 00:23:06.490
I'm not hiding anything.

00:23:06.573 --> 00:23:09.159
There's nothing to be nervous about. Jeez.

00:23:11.996 --> 00:23:14.873
So what do you plan on doing here at home?

00:23:17.668 --> 00:23:20.129
Until we can get an office,

00:23:20.212 --> 00:23:22.006
we'll work from home.

00:23:22.715 --> 00:23:24.049
Do some packaging

00:23:24.133 --> 00:23:26.760
and handle deliveries.

00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:29.013
Yes.

00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:33.851
You too, Han-na?

00:23:35.019 --> 00:23:36.311
Yes.

00:23:36.395 --> 00:23:40.149
And while we're working,
I'll help out with the housework.

00:23:40.232 --> 00:23:42.067
We'll help out together.

00:23:45.612 --> 00:23:46.488
Okay.

00:23:48.657 --> 00:23:51.744
And you knew about all this?

00:23:52.369 --> 00:23:53.912
Absolutely not.

00:23:54.997 --> 00:23:56.790
Not all of it.

00:23:57.708 --> 00:23:59.543
Just some of it.

00:24:09.511 --> 00:24:12.556
Fine. You three can figure it out.
I'm staying out of it.

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:14.058
Just handle things yourselves.

00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:17.311
Why three? It's just them. I'm not--

00:24:21.774 --> 00:24:22.691
Gosh.

00:24:23.317 --> 00:24:26.070
Dad, I've given this a lot of thought.

00:24:27.571 --> 00:24:29.281
How much will you sell them for?

00:24:29.907 --> 00:24:34.203
Around 78,000 won.

00:24:42.961 --> 00:24:44.880
FOR LEASE
THREE MILLION WON PER MONTH

00:24:57.184 --> 00:24:58.185
Jeez, you scared me.

00:24:59.019 --> 00:24:59.937
Who are you?

00:25:04.108 --> 00:25:05.859
Can I help you?

00:25:07.444 --> 00:25:10.239
-Never mind.
-Just say it. What is it?

00:25:14.827 --> 00:25:17.663
If you don't mind,
may I say just a few words?

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:19.039
Sure. Go ahead.

00:25:23.127 --> 00:25:24.378
This won't work.

00:25:24.878 --> 00:25:26.130
Who would pay three million won?

00:25:26.213 --> 00:25:29.383
If you were the tenant,
would you pay that much for this place?

00:25:32.219 --> 00:25:33.554
Then how much should it be?

00:25:33.637 --> 00:25:36.306
How can you even think
about collecting rent now?

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.225
"First Year Rent-Free."

00:25:38.934 --> 00:25:40.644
Even then, I doubt anyone would take it.

00:25:42.646 --> 00:25:45.274
Do you have any idea
what this place is worth?

00:25:45.357 --> 00:25:46.984
Between 1 and 1.1 billion won.

00:25:47.526 --> 00:25:48.902
Wait, how do you…

00:25:51.655 --> 00:25:52.990
Are you involved somehow?

00:25:53.073 --> 00:25:55.033
Well, I am…

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.912
-involved.
-What do you mean, "involved…"

00:25:59.955 --> 00:26:01.832
Involved how?

00:26:01.915 --> 00:26:04.501
Tell me. What do you mean?

00:26:04.585 --> 00:26:05.586
Don't tell me you're…

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:07.921
Wait, could you be…

00:26:14.428 --> 00:26:15.679
NA DAE-RYONG
PSYCHIATRIST

00:26:17.181 --> 00:26:19.975
You're the doctor at the clinic

00:26:20.058 --> 00:26:21.768
on the second floor.

00:26:25.022 --> 00:26:26.148
I see.

00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:29.151
If this building does well,
you'll get more patients.

00:26:29.234 --> 00:26:31.653
That's why you're ordering me around.

00:26:31.737 --> 00:26:33.822
You don't have to worry about my clinic.

00:26:33.906 --> 00:26:36.909
It's so quiet around here.
My patients actually prefer it.

00:26:36.992 --> 00:26:38.327
Really? So why do you care?

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.578
Because

00:26:40.287 --> 00:26:42.664
you still can't seem to accept it.

00:26:42.748 --> 00:26:44.374
Accept what?

00:26:44.458 --> 00:26:47.085
This property is not worth
three million won a month.

00:26:54.343 --> 00:26:55.427
Accept reality.

00:26:57.596 --> 00:26:59.514
What difference would it make
if I accept it?

00:26:59.598 --> 00:27:00.766
Things will change.

00:27:00.849 --> 00:27:03.185
Acceptance is the first step
to solving a problem.

00:27:03.852 --> 00:27:07.147
"Acceptance… is the first step…"

00:27:07.689 --> 00:27:10.901
So you just sit in your office
saying useless things like that all day.

00:27:10.984 --> 00:27:13.111
I see. Jeez.

00:27:18.283 --> 00:27:19.451
I see you've never been.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.536
Been where?

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.374
Stop by the second floor.
We can have a chat.

00:27:27.459 --> 00:27:28.669
About what?

00:27:29.294 --> 00:27:30.754
Why would I go there?

00:27:32.506 --> 00:27:33.715
Good lord.

00:27:38.345 --> 00:27:42.015
All done. Parked it safely
right by the flowerbed.

00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:44.142
Please take care of it again later.

00:27:44.226 --> 00:27:45.477
Ms. Kim Na-gyeong?

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.020
-Yes?
-Here's your mail.

00:27:47.104 --> 00:27:48.355
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:27:48.438 --> 00:27:49.773
Excuse me.

00:27:50.357 --> 00:27:52.901
A coffee run is probably
beneath you, right?

00:27:54.152 --> 00:27:56.571
Not at all. I was just about
to get some. A hot Americano?

00:27:56.655 --> 00:27:57.823
For me…

00:27:58.699 --> 00:28:00.158
You parked by the wrong flowerbed.

00:28:00.242 --> 00:28:02.911
Really? My apologies.
I'll take care of it later.

00:28:02.995 --> 00:28:04.162
-What?
-Iced Americano.

00:28:04.246 --> 00:28:06.540
The acidic blend,
an extra shot, and use my points.

00:28:06.623 --> 00:28:09.668
You definitely said
"the acidic blend" this time.

00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:10.919
You can go now.

00:28:11.712 --> 00:28:12.963
-Sorry about that.
-Okay.

00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:14.715
Why is he going--

00:28:14.798 --> 00:28:16.133
Hey, honey!

00:28:16.216 --> 00:28:18.927
I mean, Mr. Han.
Did the Nemo Telecom deal fall through?

00:28:19.011 --> 00:28:22.514
They just tested the waters
and then bailed on us.

00:28:22.597 --> 00:28:25.183
We put so much effort into it for months.

00:28:25.267 --> 00:28:26.435
What do we do now?

00:28:26.518 --> 00:28:29.896
Actually, instead of piggybacking
on a company like Nemo Telecom,

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.317
it'd be far more effective to score
a direct deal with a major corporation.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.526
You want to…

00:28:35.736 --> 00:28:39.323
integrate your in-app payment system
with their membership points, right?

00:28:49.875 --> 00:28:51.084
Well, shall I

00:28:51.668 --> 00:28:54.254
set up a meeting with ACT?

00:28:57.716 --> 00:28:58.759
Thanks.

00:28:58.842 --> 00:29:01.094
-Mine's the non-acidic one, right?
-Yes, of course.

00:29:01.178 --> 00:29:02.429
All right.

00:29:02.512 --> 00:29:05.223
I'll do all the prep

00:29:05.724 --> 00:29:07.392
and handle the presentation too.

00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:10.062
Nak-su, if you can make this happen,

00:29:10.145 --> 00:29:11.688
I'll give you

00:29:12.397 --> 00:29:13.982
a ten percent sales commission.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.654
Okay. Ten percent.

00:29:20.364 --> 00:29:21.823
How much would that be?

00:29:22.324 --> 00:29:25.494
Also, I'll let
the current sales director go

00:29:26.036 --> 00:29:27.537
and bring you on board.

00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:30.916
Apparently, he's the one who wasted
six months chasing Nemo Telecom.

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:34.544
From what I hear, the real authority
on the ACT sales team now

00:29:34.628 --> 00:29:36.463
is General Manager Do Jin-woo.

00:29:36.546 --> 00:29:38.673
What's your relationship with him?

00:29:38.757 --> 00:29:41.802
Please. He's my junior.
He's not even on my level.

00:29:41.885 --> 00:29:43.804
Is that so?

00:29:43.887 --> 00:29:45.889
I used to tear into him all the time.

00:29:47.849 --> 00:29:49.476
All right, then.

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:51.728
Can I assume it's settled

00:29:51.812 --> 00:29:53.355
and get started on the work today?

00:29:55.357 --> 00:29:56.566
-Don't stand up.
-Nak-su.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.568
-We're in your hands.
-Okay.

00:29:58.652 --> 00:30:00.404
-Gosh.
-We're counting on you.

00:30:00.946 --> 00:30:03.824
I'll need a desk so I can get to work.

00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:05.409
Yes! Get him one right away.

00:30:05.492 --> 00:30:08.370
A desk! We'll get you one right now.

00:30:08.453 --> 00:30:10.497
You can use this room.

00:30:11.665 --> 00:30:12.707
You can use…

00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:14.459
Ten percent.

00:30:15.377 --> 00:30:16.920
IN-APP PAYMENT INTEGRATION PROPOSAL

00:30:27.639 --> 00:30:29.599
Sung-gu, how did it go?

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.185
November is way too late.

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:35.063
Did Do Jin-woo say
he can't make time at all?

00:30:35.147 --> 00:30:36.731
Can't you do something about it?

00:30:36.815 --> 00:30:38.358
Please do me a favor.

00:30:38.442 --> 00:30:39.484
All right, good.

00:30:39.985 --> 00:30:41.403
Okay. Thank you.

00:30:43.113 --> 00:30:45.198
That jerk. Acting like he's too busy.

00:30:48.326 --> 00:30:49.619
DIGITAL FINANCE AND FINTECH SOFTWARE…

00:30:53.748 --> 00:30:55.333
QR-BASED PAYMENT
POINT-OF-SALE INTEGRATION

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.892
Since the pandemic,
mobile-based consumption has surged.

00:31:11.975 --> 00:31:14.936
Contactless payments
continue to be preferred.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.980
In-app payment is no longer just an option

00:31:18.148 --> 00:31:20.484
but has established itself
as the default payment method.

00:31:20.859 --> 00:31:21.902
THE FINTECH MARKET…

00:31:23.236 --> 00:31:24.404
…LEVERAGING THE USER BASE…

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.117
As converting dormant points into cash
becomes more common…

00:31:55.352 --> 00:31:57.062
Did you forget how hard it was…

00:31:59.231 --> 00:32:01.191
to get money out of people? You idiot.

00:32:03.777 --> 00:32:04.736
Let's do this.

00:32:10.992 --> 00:32:13.078
FOR LEASE
THREE MILLION WON PER MONTH

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.293
FOR LEASE
THREE MILLION PER MONTH

00:32:20.377 --> 00:32:22.921
FIRST THREE MONTHS FREE!
RESTAURANTS, CAFES, SELF-CHECKOUT STORES

00:32:41.523 --> 00:32:43.275
So there are patients after all.

00:32:43.358 --> 00:32:45.318
Hyeon-jun, your phone.

00:32:45.402 --> 00:32:47.821
-Thank you.
-Of course.

00:32:47.904 --> 00:32:49.281
-He looks fine.
-See you.

00:32:49.364 --> 00:32:50.740
-Yes, see you next time.
-Okay.

00:33:14.139 --> 00:33:16.057
You've been staring at me.

00:33:17.934 --> 00:33:19.144
What? When?

00:33:20.186 --> 00:33:21.563
Never mind, then.

00:33:24.608 --> 00:33:26.276
I'm not some weirdo.

00:33:27.402 --> 00:33:28.737
Okay.

00:33:29.696 --> 00:33:31.865
I just have trouble breathing sometimes.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.160
My chest suddenly feels tight,

00:33:36.077 --> 00:33:39.122
and I can't ride the bus.

00:33:40.582 --> 00:33:43.043
So it's like a panic disorder.

00:33:46.212 --> 00:33:48.048
What did the doctor tell you to do?

00:33:53.136 --> 00:33:54.220
Well?

00:33:54.763 --> 00:33:56.222
No wonder you were staring.

00:33:56.306 --> 00:33:57.849
What are you talking about, kid?

00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:01.978
If you need to see him, do it soon.

00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:07.359
Why would I go see him? You're ridiculous.

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:08.943
At first,

00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:13.031
my mom said
it was just my lack of willpower.

00:34:14.032 --> 00:34:15.992
Now, she says she's very sorry.

00:34:20.538 --> 00:34:23.458
You shouldn't do anything
you'll feel sorry for later.

00:34:33.635 --> 00:34:35.887
Do you not like it, or are you not hungry?

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:38.682
It's delicious. I'm eating just fine. Why?

00:34:38.765 --> 00:34:41.267
Then stop picking at your food
and eat up.

00:34:41.351 --> 00:34:43.228
Your face is looking thin.

00:34:43.978 --> 00:34:45.188
What is it?

00:34:45.897 --> 00:34:48.191
No, I'm just trying to eat more veggies.

00:34:48.274 --> 00:34:49.859
Goodness.

00:34:49.943 --> 00:34:51.736
Mr. Kim, this seaweed is so good.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.697
-Right? It's delicious.
-Have some.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.532
Thank you.

00:34:56.908 --> 00:34:59.411
-It's really good.
-I'll get you more. There's plenty.

00:35:03.123 --> 00:35:04.541
Put some over here too.

00:35:04.624 --> 00:35:05.500
Okay.

00:35:06.793 --> 00:35:07.752
Dig in.

00:35:18.096 --> 00:35:19.222
Are the clothes selling well?

00:35:20.306 --> 00:35:21.433
No.

00:35:22.308 --> 00:35:25.311
Once they go viral,
they'll sell out in no time.

00:35:26.354 --> 00:35:29.649
Mr. Kim, please teach your son
the tricks of the trade.

00:35:29.733 --> 00:35:31.943
He doesn't listen to me at all.

00:35:32.026 --> 00:35:33.528
Trust me.

00:35:33.611 --> 00:35:36.322
Once we hit our stride,
we'll sell them all.

00:35:39.284 --> 00:35:40.535
Shoot.

00:35:40.618 --> 00:35:43.079
-Hello, Sang-cheol.
-Nak-su, when are you coming in?

00:35:43.163 --> 00:35:45.957
I was planning to go straight to ACT.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.084
Come on, it's the big day.

00:35:48.168 --> 00:35:49.544
We should go together.

00:35:49.627 --> 00:35:50.795
Come by 11:00, sir.

00:35:50.879 --> 00:35:52.380
Really? Okay, I got it.

00:35:52.464 --> 00:35:54.340
Oh my, I need to get ready.

00:35:54.424 --> 00:35:56.843
-Okay, I'll get your things.
-Jeez.

00:35:56.926 --> 00:35:58.178
Eat up, you two.

00:35:59.345 --> 00:36:00.764
He barely touched his food.

00:36:11.483 --> 00:36:13.026
-Hi, honey.
-Is Ha-yeong coming with us?

00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:15.028
Yes, we usually go to meetings together.

00:36:15.111 --> 00:36:16.488
-I see.
-Why?

00:36:17.155 --> 00:36:18.406
Well…

00:36:21.493 --> 00:36:23.286
Should I sit this one out?

00:36:23.369 --> 00:36:24.579
No, of course not.

00:36:24.662 --> 00:36:26.581
I'll drive. You two get in the back.

00:36:26.664 --> 00:36:28.249
-All right.
-Come on.

00:36:40.136 --> 00:36:41.846
POINT UTILIZATION INFERIOR TO COMPETITORS

00:36:45.475 --> 00:36:46.518
-Nak-su.
-Yes?

00:36:47.185 --> 00:36:48.603
What, you don't like it?

00:36:49.729 --> 00:36:50.855
It's not that.

00:36:51.606 --> 00:36:52.649
It's perfect.

00:36:53.817 --> 00:36:55.652
The concept, design, and research

00:36:55.735 --> 00:36:57.695
really make the proposal stand out.

00:36:57.779 --> 00:36:58.905
Do you think so?

00:36:58.988 --> 00:37:02.617
I can tell you worked
at a major corporation for a long time.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.953
-You're no joke.
-Right?

00:37:05.036 --> 00:37:07.330
It's a waste to take this only to ACT.

00:37:08.331 --> 00:37:10.583
We should pitch this
to all three major telecom companies.

00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:12.210
That's a great idea.

00:37:12.293 --> 00:37:13.920
-Nice.
-Okay, it's this one.

00:37:14.003 --> 00:37:16.589
-I need you to click it. Click-click.
-Yes. I love it.

00:37:24.222 --> 00:37:25.473
Thank you.

00:37:28.768 --> 00:37:30.270
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:37:30.353 --> 00:37:31.437
Let's head in.

00:37:31.521 --> 00:37:32.480
Let's go.

00:37:49.873 --> 00:37:51.291
Nak-su, are you coming?

00:37:51.374 --> 00:37:52.625
We're late. Hurry up.

00:37:52.709 --> 00:37:54.544
Okay, I'm coming.

00:37:54.627 --> 00:37:57.630
-Think you can handle it?
-Please, this stuff is easy.

00:37:57.714 --> 00:37:59.757
-It is? To go to the next slide…
-Yes.

00:37:59.841 --> 00:38:01.467
-Click. That's it.
-Click. Okay.

00:38:01.551 --> 00:38:03.011
-Click. Snap.
-Click.

00:38:03.094 --> 00:38:03.970
-Click.
-Click.

00:38:06.014 --> 00:38:07.473
-Got it.
-Two, three.

00:38:07.557 --> 00:38:10.143
-Click.
-Okay. We cut it by 40%.

00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:11.936
-Click, okay.
-Click. That's perfect.

00:38:13.688 --> 00:38:15.440
So, once the payment goes through…

00:38:15.523 --> 00:38:17.400
-Click.
-So the direction…

00:38:17.483 --> 00:38:19.319
-Click.
-Click.

00:38:19.944 --> 00:38:21.154
-Two, three.
-Click.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.324
Let me know when to change the slide.

00:38:29.913 --> 00:38:31.915
…when you ask me, and I'll…

00:38:33.499 --> 00:38:34.751
Click.

00:38:42.258 --> 00:38:43.801
MANAGING DIRECTOR BAEK JEONG-TAE

00:38:58.858 --> 00:38:59.734
-Mr. Song.
-Yes?

00:39:02.236 --> 00:39:03.821
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

00:39:04.864 --> 00:39:06.282
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

00:39:06.366 --> 00:39:07.450
Yes, hello.

00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:09.619
Hello, sir.

00:39:10.244 --> 00:39:12.121
Hello. My goodness.

00:39:12.205 --> 00:39:13.414
Welcome.

00:39:15.083 --> 00:39:16.918
These are the people I mentioned.

00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:19.796
-I'm Han Sang-cheol.
-Hello. I'm General Manager Do Jin-woo.

00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:21.923
-I'm Director Park Ha-yeong.
-Nice to meet you.

00:39:23.216 --> 00:39:25.343
I was a little disappointed, sir.

00:39:25.426 --> 00:39:26.594
What?

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.013
How could you just leave so suddenly?

00:39:29.097 --> 00:39:31.808
I should have at least
treated you to a proper meal.

00:39:33.142 --> 00:39:35.395
Things were hectic back then.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.522
Once this project is wrapped up,

00:39:37.605 --> 00:39:40.441
we can arrange something then.

00:39:40.525 --> 00:39:42.193
I'll look forward to it, sir.

00:39:42.735 --> 00:39:44.070
Let's move to the conference room.

00:39:44.153 --> 00:39:45.488
Okay.

00:39:45.571 --> 00:39:47.824
-Jun-seop, finish up here.
-Yes, sir.

00:39:53.371 --> 00:39:55.665
Next, by integrating
our in-app payment module

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.168
within the ACT membership app…

00:40:00.545 --> 00:40:01.587
Next slide.

00:40:02.088 --> 00:40:03.464
As you can see…

00:40:03.548 --> 00:40:04.882
What's wrong?

00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:07.802
As you can see in the table
on the next slide…

00:40:07.885 --> 00:40:08.970
Just a moment.

00:40:10.013 --> 00:40:11.097
There.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.184
By offering consumers
more ways to use their membership points,

00:40:15.268 --> 00:40:17.020
providing a better user experience,

00:40:17.103 --> 00:40:19.897
and integrating telecom membership points

00:40:19.981 --> 00:40:21.816
that were previously limited in use…

00:40:22.692 --> 00:40:23.901
What the heck?

00:40:25.028 --> 00:40:27.613
-What's wrong with this?
-By integrating telecom points

00:40:28.322 --> 00:40:29.365
that were limited,

00:40:29.449 --> 00:40:31.409
we can maximize…

00:40:31.492 --> 00:40:32.493
Is it not working?

00:40:32.577 --> 00:40:34.620
-I got it.
-…their actual impact…

00:40:34.704 --> 00:40:36.205
I said it's fine.

00:40:36.914 --> 00:40:37.957
THANK YOU

00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:39.597
Jeez.

00:40:42.086 --> 00:40:43.337
Oh boy.

00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:45.840
I prepared a lot for this,
but there were some errors.

00:40:45.923 --> 00:40:46.799
I'm sorry.

00:40:48.134 --> 00:40:50.219
Let's stop here.

00:40:50.303 --> 00:40:52.597
You've already given us
such thorough materials.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.057
No need to explain any further.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:56.225
Yes. Please refer to the email I sent you.

00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:57.310
-It's okay.
-I'm so sorry.

00:40:57.393 --> 00:40:59.479
Ms. Kwon, could you turn on
the lights, please?

00:40:59.562 --> 00:41:00.438
Yes.

00:41:03.232 --> 00:41:04.442
Oh man.

00:41:15.078 --> 00:41:17.705
Mr. Baek is not in the room.
Why is everyone so tense?

00:41:18.498 --> 00:41:19.582
Relax.

00:41:23.377 --> 00:41:26.089
-You worked so hard on this, sir.
-Well…

00:41:26.172 --> 00:41:27.632
-Good work, sir.
-Good work, sir.

00:41:27.715 --> 00:41:28.966
You really came prepared.

00:41:30.802 --> 00:41:32.428
What's your title at this company?

00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:35.848
I can answer that.
We're treating him as a director.

00:41:38.434 --> 00:41:40.603
It's been tough for our team
without you around.

00:41:40.686 --> 00:41:43.439
We've really been feeling it lately.
Haven't we?

00:41:44.315 --> 00:41:45.858
No one has anything to say?

00:41:47.276 --> 00:41:49.362
What did you all think about the proposal?

00:41:51.656 --> 00:41:53.991
Well, I reviewed

00:41:54.075 --> 00:41:56.619
all the materials you sent over by email.

00:41:56.702 --> 00:42:00.832
The proposed 1.5% commission

00:42:00.915 --> 00:42:04.293
isn't exactly the industry's lowest,

00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:08.131
as it says here…

00:42:08.214 --> 00:42:09.549
-What about you, Ms. Kwon?
-Yes?

00:42:09.632 --> 00:42:13.845
Having someone who knows our situation

00:42:13.928 --> 00:42:15.680
as the point of contact

00:42:15.763 --> 00:42:18.891
will probably make
communication easier, and--

00:42:18.975 --> 00:42:21.394
We're not here
to make our lives easier, are we?

00:42:21.978 --> 00:42:24.188
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

00:42:24.272 --> 00:42:25.565
What about you, Ik-hyeon?

00:42:25.648 --> 00:42:28.192
With 5 billion won in membership points
expiring each month,

00:42:28.276 --> 00:42:29.694
using in-app payments

00:42:29.777 --> 00:42:33.156
could increase point usage and improve
customer satisfaction while cutting costs.

00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:34.866
That's very optimistic of you.

00:42:52.133 --> 00:42:54.010
All right. Let's do this.

00:42:55.511 --> 00:42:56.721
Thank you.

00:42:58.181 --> 00:43:01.559
-I look forward to working with you.
-I look forward to it as well.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:04.478
Funny how fate works, isn't it?

00:43:05.104 --> 00:43:06.647
We ended up working together again.

00:43:08.065 --> 00:43:10.234
But as you know, Mr. Kim,

00:43:10.318 --> 00:43:13.613
we're working with
quite a few startups right now.

00:43:13.696 --> 00:43:15.781
And companies with former ACT employees

00:43:15.865 --> 00:43:18.034
are often viewed more critically.

00:43:18.117 --> 00:43:20.286
I trust you'll understand
where we're coming from.

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:23.206
Since you're proposing a six-month trial,

00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:24.999
can we focus on building mutual trust…

00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:29.003
and proceed with the contract
on a no-commission basis?

00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:34.175
I shouldn't be speaking
to you about this, Mr. Kim.

00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:36.802
-What do you say, Mr. Han?
-And after the six months?

00:43:36.886 --> 00:43:38.721
You get upgraded to a partner company.

00:43:38.804 --> 00:43:41.974
As a reward for your patience,
we'll make sure to offer you

00:43:42.058 --> 00:43:43.684
better terms than what you proposed today.

00:43:43.768 --> 00:43:46.354
-Can we trust you on that?
-Wait. Hold on.

00:43:46.437 --> 00:43:47.396
Of course.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.649
All right. Let's do it.

00:43:49.732 --> 00:43:52.401
You're very decisive, sir.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.279
I was a science major,
so I'm quick with numbers.

00:43:55.363 --> 00:43:56.822
I see.

00:43:56.906 --> 00:43:58.950
I majored in engineering,
so I knew nothing at first.

00:43:59.033 --> 00:44:00.576
Nak-su gave me a really hard time.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.246
-Really?
-Why would you do that, Mr. Kim?

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:06.874
All right. Then we're agreed.

00:44:06.958 --> 00:44:09.502
I'll see you
at the follow-up meeting, Mr. Kim.

00:44:11.879 --> 00:44:13.756
-Sir, could I have a word?
-Sure, of course.

00:44:15.508 --> 00:44:17.760
You can take your time to catch up.

00:44:20.346 --> 00:44:21.514
Man.

00:44:27.728 --> 00:44:28.854
Mr. Kim.

00:44:31.983 --> 00:44:33.276
Good work, sir.

00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:35.069
-Good work, sir.
-Good work, sir.

00:44:37.488 --> 00:44:38.614
Thanks, everyone.

00:44:46.414 --> 00:44:47.581
Yes, sir.

00:44:56.632 --> 00:44:58.426
-You were great.
-I know, right?

00:44:58.509 --> 00:45:00.928
-So pretty too.
-I think I was born for this.

00:45:01.512 --> 00:45:04.181
Nak-su. Let's get going.
Traffic's going to be bad.

00:45:05.725 --> 00:45:07.560
-Why did you do that?
-Excuse me?

00:45:07.643 --> 00:45:09.729
They're not paying us a dime
for six months.

00:45:09.812 --> 00:45:11.731
Why did you jump at the offer?

00:45:11.814 --> 00:45:15.151
We have to play the long game
and get our foot in the door.

00:45:15.234 --> 00:45:19.030
On the bright side, we're getting
free exposure for our service.

00:45:19.113 --> 00:45:22.325
And they promised to make us
a partner company in six months.

00:45:22.408 --> 00:45:23.659
What about me?

00:45:23.743 --> 00:45:25.828
I made dozens of calls
just to get this meeting.

00:45:25.911 --> 00:45:28.456
And I stayed up for days prepping.

00:45:28.539 --> 00:45:30.624
You promised me ten percent of the sales.

00:45:32.418 --> 00:45:34.170
I'll go get the car.

00:45:34.253 --> 00:45:36.756
-Okay. Thanks, Ha-yeong.
-Say something.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.345
You have no reason to be mad at me.

00:45:42.428 --> 00:45:45.264
Weren't you the one
who said you had pull around here?

00:45:46.223 --> 00:45:49.393
Then you should've used that pull.
I'm the one who's taking the hit.

00:45:50.644 --> 00:45:53.022
You were acting like you'd crush it

00:45:53.105 --> 00:45:54.648
once you got to ACT.

00:45:55.274 --> 00:45:56.400
But you were stammering

00:45:56.484 --> 00:45:58.402
and breaking out in a cold sweat.

00:45:59.862 --> 00:46:01.739
If this is how you are on your home turf,

00:46:01.822 --> 00:46:05.159
how could I possibly trust you
and make you the sales director?

00:46:05.242 --> 00:46:06.410
Let's go for now.

00:46:06.911 --> 00:46:08.746
-We can talk on the way.
-Hey.

00:46:10.873 --> 00:46:13.626
You called me this morning
just to drive you, didn't you?

00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:17.129
You were the one who offered to drive.

00:46:17.213 --> 00:46:19.215
I happen to have a good eye for people.

00:46:20.466 --> 00:46:23.803
I remember the day I first met you
like it was yesterday.

00:46:23.886 --> 00:46:25.012
What are you doing?

00:46:25.096 --> 00:46:28.349
"This guy is a snake,
just testing the waters."

00:46:29.141 --> 00:46:31.185
"We're definitely not going to get along."

00:46:32.269 --> 00:46:34.021
Hey, that's a bit--

00:46:34.105 --> 00:46:35.606
For some reason, I never liked you.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.735
That's why I still haven't saved
your number in my phone. Got it?

00:46:39.819 --> 00:46:42.238
Nak-su, if you keep going,

00:46:43.155 --> 00:46:44.657
I'll tell you about some of my grudges.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.158
I don't care.

00:46:46.659 --> 00:46:48.702
And you two seemed to get along great.

00:46:48.786 --> 00:46:50.496
Do Jin-woo is a snake too.

00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:51.872
You two have fun.

00:46:53.582 --> 00:46:54.875
But in the end,

00:46:55.668 --> 00:46:57.294
you'll get what's coming to you.

00:46:58.504 --> 00:46:59.839
You snake bastard.

00:47:02.591 --> 00:47:03.467
Nak-su.

00:47:04.093 --> 00:47:05.010
Nak-su!

00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:41.172
NTC BANK

00:47:41.255 --> 00:47:44.508
OCTOBER LOAN INTEREST PAYMENT NOTICE
INTEREST AMOUNT: 3,208,333 WON

00:48:31.263 --> 00:48:32.306
Hey, Su-gyeom.

00:48:32.848 --> 00:48:35.267
-Yes?
-How much longer are you gonna do this?

00:48:35.935 --> 00:48:36.936
Well…

00:48:37.561 --> 00:48:40.105
I don't know.
I'm not sure when we'll sell everything.

00:48:46.862 --> 00:48:48.614
-Kim Su-gyeom.
-Yes?

00:48:48.697 --> 00:48:50.783
What did I tell you
when I gave you that money?

00:48:50.866 --> 00:48:52.117
Answer me.

00:48:52.826 --> 00:48:55.579
What did I say when I gave you
the 30 million?

00:48:58.207 --> 00:48:59.917
To focus on school.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.545
So how long are you going
to keep doing this nonsense?

00:49:02.628 --> 00:49:05.256
When are you going to stop
playing this little game?

00:49:08.551 --> 00:49:09.593
Dad.

00:49:10.469 --> 00:49:12.388
I know how hard you worked for that money.

00:49:13.222 --> 00:49:16.934
That's why I want to make money fast,
so I can pay you back right away.

00:49:17.851 --> 00:49:18.978
I just…

00:49:22.106 --> 00:49:23.440
I'm sorry.

00:49:26.193 --> 00:49:28.487
That's not what I want to hear.

00:49:29.863 --> 00:49:31.073
Su-gyeom.

00:49:31.156 --> 00:49:34.118
You go off on your own,
taking risks, failing…

00:49:34.201 --> 00:49:35.452
Fine, I get it.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.039
But do you know what happens
when you're drowning in debt?

00:49:40.416 --> 00:49:42.668
You end up losing yourself.

00:49:43.294 --> 00:49:46.422
You'll lose sight of who you are
and why you started this.

00:49:46.505 --> 00:49:48.507
That's worse than losing money.

00:49:48.591 --> 00:49:52.177
You need to stay inside the same fence
as everyone else, no matter what.

00:49:52.678 --> 00:49:54.847
Even if it looks uncool to you,

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:56.515
even if it doesn't seem impressive,

00:49:57.266 --> 00:49:59.852
that fence is the only thing
that keeps you safe in the end.

00:49:59.935 --> 00:50:00.853
Dad.

00:50:02.896 --> 00:50:04.148
But that fence

00:50:05.274 --> 00:50:06.817
didn't keep you safe.

00:50:09.528 --> 00:50:12.615
That fence lead you
to the middle of nowhere, made you suffer,

00:50:13.115 --> 00:50:14.783
and pushed you out.

00:50:17.202 --> 00:50:18.787
Did you see that coming?

00:50:20.831 --> 00:50:21.874
You didn't.

00:50:23.334 --> 00:50:25.669
You couldn't keep yourself safe.

00:50:28.213 --> 00:50:31.884
So how can you be so sure
about my future?

00:50:45.814 --> 00:50:47.983
I guess you're right.

00:50:49.151 --> 00:50:51.070
I'm not in a position to say that.

00:50:52.154 --> 00:50:53.989
That's not what I meant.

00:50:54.073 --> 00:50:54.990
Hey. Listen.

00:50:55.658 --> 00:50:58.118
When I get a good job
and make a lot of money,

00:50:58.202 --> 00:51:00.245
you'd better listen to me then, okay?

00:51:01.288 --> 00:51:03.582
-Dad, I--
-Get back to work. Sorry to bother you.

00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:06.043
Dad, that's not what I…

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.715
I didn't know you were home.

00:51:11.799 --> 00:51:13.926
Yes, I got home early.

00:51:18.097 --> 00:51:19.473
You should eat.

00:51:19.556 --> 00:51:21.517
I already ate. I'm going to wash up.

00:51:22.434 --> 00:51:23.394
Honey.

00:51:25.979 --> 00:51:27.272
Nothing's going on, right?

00:51:29.108 --> 00:51:31.026
I almost wish something was going on.

00:51:33.529 --> 00:51:34.488
I'm fine.

00:52:24.371 --> 00:52:25.748
Yes, I'm on my way.

00:52:25.831 --> 00:52:27.082
Of course.

00:52:27.166 --> 00:52:30.461
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Please wait just a bit longer.

00:52:34.381 --> 00:52:36.759
Excuse me, are you waiting
for a designated driver?

00:52:36.842 --> 00:52:38.802
-Yes.
-All right.

00:52:39.887 --> 00:52:43.140
I'm sorry to ask,
but could I put this scooter in the trunk?

00:52:43.223 --> 00:52:44.224
Sure. Go ahead.

00:52:44.308 --> 00:52:46.727
Great, thank you. Please get in.

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:02.910
Rerouting.

00:53:02.993 --> 00:53:03.994
TURN LEFT

00:53:07.206 --> 00:53:09.374
How many times is that now?

00:53:09.458 --> 00:53:12.002
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

00:53:12.503 --> 00:53:14.129
Can't you see the screen?

00:53:14.213 --> 00:53:16.590
You should've turned left back there.

00:53:17.132 --> 00:53:19.384
I'm very sorry.
I'll get you there right away.

00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:34.441
Here we are.

00:53:38.153 --> 00:53:39.822
Thank you.

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:43.408
Where am I anyway?

00:54:21.196 --> 00:54:22.114
AWAITING RIDE REQUEST

00:54:24.533 --> 00:54:25.742
It's 200,000 won.

00:54:25.826 --> 00:54:27.411
What? To Yangsu-ri?

00:54:28.537 --> 00:54:30.539
It'll be tough to get back.

00:54:31.832 --> 00:54:33.083
Let's just go. Where are they?

00:54:33.166 --> 00:54:34.668
19 JUNGGI-RO 9-GIL, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL

00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:36.837
Why here of all places? Damn it.

00:54:38.839 --> 00:54:40.841
TTOKDARI DINER

00:54:45.178 --> 00:54:47.639
Jeez, he always gets ramyeon.

00:54:47.723 --> 00:54:49.433
Let's get grilled mackerel.

00:54:49.516 --> 00:54:50.851
-They have squid here.
-Ramyeon.

00:54:50.934 --> 00:54:52.769
-Fine, get the squid.
-I'm getting what I want.

00:54:52.853 --> 00:54:55.564
-Ramyeon. Here.
-Hey!

00:54:55.647 --> 00:54:56.773
Hey.

00:54:59.318 --> 00:55:01.945
-This isn't even cuttlefish.
-How can you drive--

00:55:02.029 --> 00:55:03.196
The designated driver?

00:55:03.906 --> 00:55:05.949
-Yes.
-Okay. I'm out of here!

00:55:06.033 --> 00:55:08.160
You punk. Come on.
When did you call for a driver?

00:55:08.243 --> 00:55:11.955
-Where are you going, man?
-Hey, I have to go.

00:55:12.039 --> 00:55:14.917
Sorry about that. Those bastards.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.251
-Hey, you--
-Let's go.

00:55:16.335 --> 00:55:17.210
Okay.

00:55:17.294 --> 00:55:19.796
My car's the black one across the street.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.424
-Mr. Kim.
-What? Mr. Kim?

00:55:22.507 --> 00:55:23.592
Mr. Kim?

00:55:27.012 --> 00:55:28.013
Mister.

00:55:28.096 --> 00:55:30.307
I'm so tired here.

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.475
Right.

00:55:33.477 --> 00:55:36.146
Seriously, why did you drink so much?

00:55:36.229 --> 00:55:38.106
He's my friend. Say hi.

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:39.358
Let's go. See you next time.

00:55:39.441 --> 00:55:41.777
-Come on.
-The car's over there!

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.612
-Over there?
-Just go that way.

00:55:43.695 --> 00:55:44.571
Let's go!

00:55:44.655 --> 00:55:46.823
All right, Mr. Kim
will take you home tonight.

00:55:46.907 --> 00:55:48.325
Got it?

00:55:48.408 --> 00:55:50.410
I'll call you later. Good work today.

00:55:50.494 --> 00:55:51.662
Okay, sir.

00:55:51.745 --> 00:55:53.497
Why are you doing this to me?

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.958
Round two is on me!

00:56:05.509 --> 00:56:07.260
GO STRAIGHT FOR 8 KM

00:56:10.514 --> 00:56:11.932
What is it?

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:16.061
Getting a call
from a punk like you at this hour

00:56:16.144 --> 00:56:18.230
already puts me in a bad mood.

00:56:18.814 --> 00:56:20.816
What is it, Mr. Kim?

00:56:22.693 --> 00:56:26.321
You said you checked everything, Mr. Kim.

00:56:31.451 --> 00:56:32.661
Hey!

00:56:32.744 --> 00:56:38.125
I told you to check it
three or four times, didn't I?

00:56:38.208 --> 00:56:41.086
The meeting's tomorrow!

00:56:41.753 --> 00:56:44.297
Who do you think you are
to take responsibility?

00:56:45.173 --> 00:56:48.719
You're a grown man
and you still can't get anything right.

00:56:49.761 --> 00:56:53.598
Just submit your resignation
tomorrow morning.

00:56:53.682 --> 00:56:55.225
No excuses.

00:56:55.308 --> 00:56:58.520
I'll make sure you get
a generous severance package.

00:56:58.603 --> 00:57:01.273
Go start your own business.

00:57:01.356 --> 00:57:04.359
Open a chicken joint.
I'll order from you every day.

00:57:04.985 --> 00:57:07.571
Enough, you bastard! Just shut up!

00:57:07.654 --> 00:57:10.407
I'm so sick of you!

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:11.908
You bastard, you need to…

00:57:14.036 --> 00:57:18.915
That's right. You're going
to get an earful from my driver.

00:57:18.999 --> 00:57:22.002
Sir, tell this bastard
to get his act together.

00:57:22.085 --> 00:57:24.087
Just swear at him for me.

00:57:24.171 --> 00:57:25.338
Sir, please don't do this.

00:57:25.422 --> 00:57:28.050
I'm so frustrated
that I'm about to lose my mind.

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.470
Let him have it, please.

00:57:31.553 --> 00:57:33.013
Just one good swear word.

00:57:34.389 --> 00:57:35.599
That's enough, sir.

00:57:35.682 --> 00:57:39.561
Okay, if you swear at him,
I'll give you an extra 200,000 won.

00:57:40.062 --> 00:57:43.690
Getting 200,000 won to swear?
That's not bad, right?

00:57:45.275 --> 00:57:47.444
You're okay with it, right?

00:57:47.527 --> 00:57:49.279
He says it's fine.

00:57:49.362 --> 00:57:51.907
Just let him have it!

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:53.909
Sir, you're very drunk.

00:57:53.992 --> 00:57:56.536
Shut up! Just take it like a man!

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:57.871
Okay?

00:57:59.247 --> 00:58:00.665
Sir.

00:58:00.749 --> 00:58:03.668
You don't want the extra 200,000 won?

00:58:04.211 --> 00:58:06.963
You get 400,000 in total!

00:58:07.798 --> 00:58:08.757
Jeez!

00:58:12.803 --> 00:58:13.929
Get a grip.

00:58:14.012 --> 00:58:17.265
Damn it. I said to swear at him!

00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:19.059
You son of a bitch!

00:58:19.935 --> 00:58:21.269
"Son of a…"

00:58:24.397 --> 00:58:27.025
Hey, Mr. Kim.

00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:30.237
Please get a grip.

00:58:30.737 --> 00:58:33.907
Did you spend all these years
with your head up your ass?

00:58:34.449 --> 00:58:38.829
If it wasn't for me,
you'd have been fired long ago.

00:58:39.538 --> 00:58:41.915
So do your job right, okay?

00:58:41.998 --> 00:58:43.083
Hey.

00:59:48.148 --> 00:59:55.113
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:27.979
So your wife still doesn't know
about the first-floor property you bought.

01:00:28.063 --> 01:00:29.189
Sir!

01:00:29.272 --> 01:00:30.232
The water's not working.

01:00:30.315 --> 01:00:31.213
Excuse me, Dr. Na.

01:00:31.313 --> 01:00:33.944
I think we're on the same level
of stupidity. I can't trust that guy.

01:00:34.027 --> 01:00:38.073
This apartment is the culmination
of my 51 years.

01:00:38.156 --> 01:00:39.449
Dad, you're the best!

01:00:40.242 --> 01:00:41.826
-Who?
-I got kicked out.

01:00:42.327 --> 01:00:45.205
When you hear something like that,
how does it make you feel?

01:00:45.288 --> 01:00:46.831
I'm with a patient.

01:00:46.915 --> 01:00:49.292
Sitting face-to-face
with a complete stranger…

01:00:49.376 --> 01:00:51.503
I really can't do that.

01:00:51.586 --> 01:00:54.798
Do you two even consider me
part of this family?

01:00:54.881 --> 01:00:56.883
Come to your senses, Kim Nak-su!

01:01:00.681 --> 01:01:02.681
