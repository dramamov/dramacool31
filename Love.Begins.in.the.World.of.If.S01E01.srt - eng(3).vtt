Hello.

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:45.450
SEAS SYSTEM, Sales
Department. Kano speaking.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.020
Yes.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.360
Okay.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.430
Please hold on.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.410
Ah, Iwase.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.040
- Sawada Denko is on the line...
- Put him through.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.510
This project is...

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.040
Kano-san, could you
please check this document?

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.190
Got it.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.720
Um...

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.180
What do you think?

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.579
For this system implementation case,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.010
it would be better to add some
more specific explanations.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.010
Oh...

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.040
For example?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.520
You could add how the system
customizes production management.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.560
And also mention the additional
module for data conversion.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.990
Isn't that something from
the development department?

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.920
I don't think the clients
will understand that...

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.380
Even so, they should know
that these functions are available.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.960
Kano-san, you used to be in the technical
department, so you understand this stuff.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.390
But regular clients really won't get it.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.730
The director said so too.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.340
He said your documents
are too technical, Kano-san.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800
Okay.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.690
This is fine.
I'll handle the rest.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.790
Thanks.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.915
[Technical jargon]

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.500
What was that about?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.500
This.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.770
Oh, Kano.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.650
Ah, Morioka-san. It's been a while.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.580
We haven't had much chance to
see each other since you moved floors.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.020
Eating alone?

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.420
Not eating with your colleagues?

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.000
- Ah... yeah.
- I see.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.370
So, how are things?

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.460
Are you getting used
to the sales department?

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.120
Not really. It's too different from
the work in the technical department.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.640
To be honest, I want to go back.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.820
I hear that.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.909
You were just on leave
because you had the flu.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.039
And when you came
back, you were transferred.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.930
That's just too much.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.380
I'm still pissed about it.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.650
Don't say that.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.089
It's because you're so capable

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.100
that you can handle the job of sales tech.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.090
Hmm... You think so?

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.200
Even if I have the knowledge,
I'm not good at talking.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.386
And the atmosphere in
the sales department...

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.690
I just feel like I don't fit in.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.790
Ah! But don't you have a
colleague from your batch there?

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.320
I do, but...

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.490
Kano.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.820
Come see me after lunch.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.890
Got it.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.310
To be honest, we don't get along at all.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.600
Me and that guy, Ogami Seiji.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.400
"Love Begins in the World of If"
(Episode 1)

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.190
About this price quote...

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.430
Is there a problem with it?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.770
This quote is too cheap.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280
Huh?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
This price is within a
reasonable range, isn't it?

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.019
Whether a price is high
or low isn't for you to judge.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.750
It's up to the client.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.859
We wait until they ask
for a price reduction,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.550
and then we negotiate.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.740
But that wouldn't be a
fair price then, would it?

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.260
- Based on the man-hours, this quote is...
- Listen.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.940
Kano.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.670
This is what business
negotiation is all about.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.089
It's about skillfully guiding
the other party with your words.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.620
That's the job of a salesperson.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.550
Are you telling me to give a quote
assuming that they will try to bargain?

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.009
What if they tell us not to
come back because of it?

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.050
What will you do then?

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.140
What should you do if they
tell you not to come back?

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.400
What should I do...?

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.880
Are you just going to give up like that?

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.720
That's not it...

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.090
You're in sales now.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.520
You're not an technician.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.730
Revise the quote.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.770
I'm leaving it to you.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.040
Sales Tech.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.210
Neither sales nor tech.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.210
It perfectly describes a
half-baked existence like mine.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.396
He got into a bad mood later, which
made it hard for me to wrap things up.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.510
He's always in a good
mood when he's with me.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.009
- Don't compare yourself to him.
- Yeah.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.560
- Ogami has the best reputation among all the clients, right?
- Exactly.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.500
Well, I guess so.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.010
Oh, you're being pretty honest for once.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.950
Kano.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.790
Oh, Director. Good work today.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.770
How's the Route Printing
project with Ibushi-san going?

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.860
Yes, I went to talk
with them the other day.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.419
I've already explained to them
that with the current deadline,

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.286
it would be difficult to
implement the new specifications.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.310
I see.

00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.690
Did Ogami go with you?

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.800
No.

00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:24.699
The two of us went together
for the initial greeting,

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.520
but now I'm in charge of it alone.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.070
Is that okay?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.710
What do you mean?

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.530
Well...

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.120
It's just that you tend to
use too much jargon, Kano.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.309
Ibushi-san is the director
of the materials department.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.510
I think he should be able to understand.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.490
The project is going smoothly.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.340
That's good, then.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.080
If anything comes up,
be sure to let Ogami know.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.990
- Understood.
- Okay.

00:08:13.172 --> 00:08:15.880
I really can't understand
a word Kano-san says.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.119
He's always talking in jargon.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.400
I can't keep up at all.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.360
I feel like people from
technical backgrounds

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.140
are all so cold.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.760
I guess you could say he's all theory...

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.810
He has no sense of humor when he talks.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.360
And it seems like Kano-san
doesn't have a sales quota.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.150
The position of sales tech

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.990
seems pretty cushy.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.090
Oh no...

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.889
Ah...

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.890
Ahh..

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.320
Ah... Finally made it back...

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.422
(How to be an Outstanding Salesperson)

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.540
A sales tech's job is cushy, huh...?

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.519
My compensation is
completely different from yours.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.860
Of course I don't have a sales quota!

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.050
What I really want to tell them...

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.079
is that it's because you guys
ignore technical limitations

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.990
and always take on unreasonable projects

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.620
that I was transferred
here in the first place!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.500
Say whatever you want!

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.720
Ah! Ah!

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.520
Ah...

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.760
And that director, too...

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.360
Even without Ogami, I...

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.380
You're in sales now.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.370
Not an technician.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:57.550
Ogami must think I'm unreliable, too...

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.210
Back then...

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.550
I thought I could do better.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.300
(One year ago)

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.980
My desk...

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.500
Kano.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.060
This guy is from my batch...

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.820
I remember...

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.260
Huh?

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.910
Ah... thanks.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.610
Mm...

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.940
Okami?

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.020
Wrong.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.500
It's pronounced Ogami.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.690
It's a rare last name, isn't it?

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.660
I heard you were excellent
in the technical department.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.490
Yeah...

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.270
That's why I wanted to stay there.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.890
I know this is sudden and
you might be pissed off,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.840
but from today on, you're in sales.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.240
Nice to be working with you.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.320
That guy's smile.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.030
I haven't seen it since.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:46.590
Hello.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.260
SEAS SYSTEM, Sales
Department. Kano speaking.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.540
Ah, Ibushi-san. Thank you
for your continued support.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.110
Huh...?

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.870
(Ogami: Business trip to Osaka)

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.690
Ibushi-san!

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.350
What is it?

00:13:06.351 --> 00:13:08.336
Didn't we already make
everything clear on the phone?

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.180
No...

00:13:09.181 --> 00:13:11.680
- I wanted to explain it to you again in person.
- There's no need.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.866
The fact is that the function
wasn't implemented, right?

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.109
I believe I said it it would be difficult to
implement new standard with the current deadline.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.720
I never heard anything like that!

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.930
It was also clearly stated in the
documents I gave you the other day...

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.820
I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.176
This is clearly your fault
for not explaining it properly.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200
No.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.070
I'm sure I explained it clearly.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.560
So, are you saying it's
our fault for not listening?

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.390
No...

00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:36.160
- That's not what I meant...
- That's enough.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:37.980
I have nothing more to say to you.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.050
Calm down.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.170
Calm down... Phew...

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.520
What should I do...?

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.650
This is not good...

00:14:38.936 --> 00:14:41.582
(Ogami Seiji)

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.540
Hello...?

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.750
The director just contacted me.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.020
He said there's a problem
with you and Ibushi-san.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.680
The contract might be canceled.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.880
Tell me the details.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.170
During the meeting the other day,

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.169
I told them that with the current deadline,

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.490
it would be difficult to
implement the new specifications.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.460
But it seems I didn't
get my point across...

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.650
I see.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.640
I'll contact them again
and apologize in person.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.690
I'll go too.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.590
No, this time, let me...

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.370
What if they're not willing
to listen to you, Kano?

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.730
It'd be better for me to
go with you and apologize.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.380
This is my responsibility.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.130
It has nothing to do with you, Ogami.

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:57.125
(Apologize to Ibushi-san)

00:15:59.405 --> 00:16:01.139
[More technical jargon most likely related
to the Ibushi-san case]

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.990
Hey!

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.630
You scared me.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.210
Didn't you go straight home?

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.350
You're one to talk.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.340
Why are you still here at this hour?

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.200
I managed to get a chance to apologize
to Ibushi-san again this weekend.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.530
So you managed to set up a meeting.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.240
Did you change Tomioka's
data again without telling him?

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.050
It's faster if I just fix it since it
needs to be changed anyway.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.370
Don't try to shoulder everything yourself.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.940
You'll run yourself into the
ground if you keep this up.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.570
I'll be careful not to cause
any trouble for anyone.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.530
Here.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.540
It's chocolate.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.890
Chocolate...

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.250
You like it, right?

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.370
You have a bunch of
it over there, don't you?

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.700
Well, I'm heading out.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.720
You should head home soon too.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.080
What did he come here for?

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.050
He saw me when I was a mess.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.250
I must've looked pathetic in his eyes.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.080
But...

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.860
I don't want to make
the same mistake again.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.430
We also have to coordinate the schedules
of all related parties on our end.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.640
It's very inconvenient for us when
you postpone the delivery date like this.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.250
We're very sorry.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280
Forget it.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.380
In any case, we can't work
with your company anymore.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.000
Why is Ogami apologizing?

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.260
It's my fault...

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:29.870
No.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.640
It's my fault. I'm the one
who gave you the work.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.050
I'm used to apologizing.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.880
If you make another mistake in the future,

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.030
I'll go and apologize with you.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.860
I didn't ask you to do that.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.520
How could I let you do that?

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.230
I need to sit down somewhere...

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.280
Ah...

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.430
Ah... It's so sweet.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.890
I'm just going in circles...

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.600
What should I do...

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.240
to be on equal footing with Ogami?

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:54.840
Just kidding.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.300
It must be disgusting to be
admired by someone like me, right?

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.850
The mirror before you

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.130
will reflect the person you wish to become.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.810
If you picture your ideal self in
your mind and gaze into the mirror,

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.930
you may truly become that person.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.330
The person I wish to become...

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.540
If I could,

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.390
I'd like to fit in with the sales
department and get along with everyone...

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.540
to be acknowledged by Ogami.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.080
And to be able to smile back at him
naturally...

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.950
that's the kind of person I want to be.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.100
How foolish.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.140
Huh?

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.310
Who's there?

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.010
Kano.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.110
Kano.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560
Kano.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.020
- Ogami...? - Are you okay?!

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.460
What happened...?

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.939
I saw you walking into a shrine this late.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.976
I was worried something might've
happened, so I followed you.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.170
What happened...?

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.670
Nothing.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040
Sorry.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.660
I made you worry for nothing.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.460
Ah...

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.460
Kano.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.010
Don't make me worry so much.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.420
Huh?!

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.340
What are you doing?!

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.600
I'll take you home.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.000
It'd be bad if something happened to you.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.730
Who is this guy...?

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.600
(Next Episode Preview) What is going on?

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.250
Why is everyone acting so differently...?

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.400
(Akihito's world suddenly changes.)
Please teach me like you always do.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.500
Tell me, what happened?

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.106
(If he's Ogami from a parallel world...)
I've always been grateful for your help.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:56.599
Thank you, Kano.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.050
I need you.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.760
I'm counting on you, partner.
