But Kate still won over Aunt Aom.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.025
But if it means being blind and stupid,

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:07.065
I'd rather earn my own and keep my pride.

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:09.705
Even if I pay any amount,
you still won't do it?

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:13.985
-Correct.
-They say sharp tongue, delicious food.

00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:16.225
I guess that's true.

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.065
When I shoot for the magazine,

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:19.825
come with me.

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:21.145
Ms. Lin is here.

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:22.625
Did she come alone?

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:24.105
She's with another woman.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:40.145
Lin.

DUTCHMILL

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:05.905
Good job.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:07.265
Yeah!

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:18.745
-It hurts.
-Jane.

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:21.145
Jane.

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:30.545
Let me put this here.

00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:32.905
So you'll know I care.

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:36.985
Thanks.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:39.785
Get well soon.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:54.065
Jane!

00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:04.545
Lin.

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:07.705
I'm so sorry!

00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:10.345
It's okay.

00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:12.985
Are you alright?

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:14.745
It hurts.

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:20.305
-Thank you.
-Sure!

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:21.465
Thank you.

00:03:29.785 --> 00:03:31.025
I'm hungry.

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:34.945
Do I look good?

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:42.505
Why won't you look at me?

00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:44.025
Am I not pretty enough?

00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:49.025
You're pretty.

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:51.625
I'm just afraid

00:03:52.705 --> 00:03:53.865
I won't be able to hold back.

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:02.505
You said you couldn't hold back.

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:10.985
We're here to work today.

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:13.745
Tawan.

00:04:19.545 --> 00:04:20.624
You can't do it.

00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:23.705
The staff might come in.

00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:27.345
I was just inviting you to lunch.

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.025
If my bodyguard doesn't eat,

00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:33.305
what if something happens to me
while I'm eating alone?

00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:48.145
I'll do CPR, I guess.

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:50.305
Tawan!

00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:54.345
Come on.

00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:57.065
Let's eat and get ready.

00:04:57.785 --> 00:04:58.905
Ms. Ayla.

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:01.825
If you're done with lunch,
please let the costume team know.

00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:02.905
Sure.

00:05:02.985 --> 00:05:04.785
Fah, Lin got clipped by a car.

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:06.145
She must be hurt.

00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:07.385
-Let's check on her.
-Let's go.

00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:08.545
Tawan,

00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:10.345
let's go check on Ms. Lin.

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:13.465
Maybe someone staged this?

00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:18.425
If they did, I know what I have to do.

00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:27.145
Does it hurt?

00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:36.465
Ms. Lin, are you okay?

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:40.505
I dodged the car

00:05:40.585 --> 00:05:41.945
but fell and hit the ground.

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:44.145
I'm sorry for causing such a big deal.

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:46.905
Don't worry about it.
But is your hand okay?

00:05:48.305 --> 00:05:50.505
Tawan, can you take a look?

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:54.025
Sure. May I?

00:05:54.105 --> 00:05:55.025
Yes.

00:06:07.385 --> 00:06:08.865
You need to go to the hospital.

00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:13.145
-That bad?
-Is it serious?

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:15.705
I don't think it's a full break,

00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:17.145
probably just a fracture.

00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:20.305
But you should get an X-ray to confirm.

00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:24.705
But I don't want to mess up today's shoot.

00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:27.785
No worries.
If we need to cancel today's shoot,

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:29.905
I'll reschedule.

00:06:30.505 --> 00:06:33.025
But you can't work like this anyway.

00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:36.665
Go to the hospital first.
We'll decide after.

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.265
I'm really sorry.

00:06:51.105 --> 00:06:54.505
Ms. Lin, I really want to work with you.

00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:57.505
No matter what,
I'll definitely do this shoot with you.

00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:00.425
But today,
please go to the hospital first.

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:16.025
It's fractured. You'll need a cast.

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:17.065
Will it be long?

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.945
It's just a fracture.
It shouldn't take long.

00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:24.065
But you probably can't go back
to work today.

00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:27.305
Your right hand won't be able to move yet.

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:40.665
I'll be back with the order slip.

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:41.985
Alright.

00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:49.385
I'm sorry.

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:51.745
I didn't walk carefully.

00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:56.105
It's alright. I'll be fine in no time.

00:07:56.785 --> 00:07:59.065
-But your work--
-I already talked to Ayla.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.225
She'll reschedule.

00:08:06.545 --> 00:08:07.665
Lin.

00:08:16.985 --> 00:08:17.825
For today's shoot,

00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:20.825
I'll have to find
someone else to replace you.

00:08:24.185 --> 00:08:27.825
The client wants it
for the next issue launch.

00:08:27.905 --> 00:08:31.305
It ties into their product debut.

00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:35.185
That's okay. I understand.

00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:39.585
Please let me
take the patient to get the cast.

00:08:39.664 --> 00:08:40.745
Sure.

00:08:53.705 --> 00:08:54.905
If it weren't for you,

00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:57.265
everything would've gone smoothly.

00:08:58.185 --> 00:08:59.945
I would've finished the job
the way I wanted.

00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:02.625
And Lin could've done the job she wanted.

00:09:04.465 --> 00:09:05.785
She must be disappointed,

00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:09.305
doing all that prep just to have
someone else take the credit

00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:11.385
because of you.

00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:16.785
Think about it.

00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:19.705
You're a good chef.
Maybe stick to the kitchen

00:09:20.345 --> 00:09:22.545
instead of ruining things for others.

00:09:37.185 --> 00:09:38.425
I'm sorry.

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:41.665
You got hurt because of me.

00:09:53.945 --> 00:09:56.665
And you didn't get to do what you planned.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.545
It's really okay. I'll be
able to work again once I'm healed.

00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:09.985
But I don't know
if they'll give you the job again.

00:10:10.585 --> 00:10:13.185
It's fine if they do.
If not, that's okay too.

00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:16.065
I'd rather get hurt

00:10:16.985 --> 00:10:18.585
than see something happen to you.

00:10:26.505 --> 00:10:28.465
Poof! Get well soon.

00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:35.585
Poof! Fall in love with me forever.

00:10:38.785 --> 00:10:41.025
I already love you like crazy.

00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:50.345
Ms. Pie.

00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:10.145
Don't do it, Lin.

00:11:11.145 --> 00:11:13.945
Until you're healed,
I'll take care of everything.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:20.145
Really?

00:11:36.105 --> 00:11:37.225
What?

00:11:43.185 --> 00:11:44.345
I'm waiting.

00:11:50.145 --> 00:11:51.225
For what?

00:11:53.305 --> 00:11:55.145
You said you'd do everything.

00:11:58.705 --> 00:12:01.145
You're silly. I'll wash these glasses.

00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:10.185
Let me wash the glasses first.

00:12:12.145 --> 00:12:13.505
Fine, I'll stop teasing.

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:17.465
Lin!

00:12:26.385 --> 00:12:28.705
By the way,

00:12:28.785 --> 00:12:30.825
if Pie still wants to eat
at the restaurant, just tell me.

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.185
I'll make room for her.

00:12:36.825 --> 00:12:38.265
Are you serious?

00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:43.225
Yes.

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.465
I feel like I wronged her too.

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:51.065
She probably already
committed to her clients,

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:53.225
but after what happened,

00:12:54.945 --> 00:12:56.265
she's probably speechless too.

00:13:00.225 --> 00:13:02.585
You're seriously the sweetest.

00:13:06.865 --> 00:13:07.825
Are you done washing?

00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:14.665
Can I ask for one thing?

00:13:18.985 --> 00:13:20.585
Could you help me with the soap?

00:13:21.945 --> 00:13:24.465
I can't scrub properly with the cast.

00:13:33.265 --> 00:13:34.145
Isn't your arm tired?

00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:37.025
Of course it is.

00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:41.745
It won't get wet. Put it down already.

00:13:45.785 --> 00:13:48.505
It's wrapped tighter than a sausage.
It's waterproof.

00:13:49.505 --> 00:13:52.265
I just don't want it to get wet.
It might itch later.

00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:55.385
Rest it here, then.

00:13:58.865 --> 00:13:59.945
That way it stays dry.

00:14:02.905 --> 00:14:04.225
Thank you.

00:14:04.305 --> 00:14:05.425
You're welcome.

00:14:36.025 --> 00:14:37.745
That's how you know I care.

00:14:40.265 --> 00:14:41.705
You still remember?

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:44.025
Of course.

00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:47.825
I remember everything about you.

00:14:52.105 --> 00:14:53.105
Now go to sleep.

00:14:59.505 --> 00:15:00.345
Good night.

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:06.305
Wait,

00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:08.305
why are you sleeping on the floor?

00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:09.625
Afraid you'll hurt my hand?

00:15:14.265 --> 00:15:16.025
Sleep next to me.

00:15:29.985 --> 00:15:31.505
Here.

00:15:42.465 --> 00:15:45.225
I'll rest my arm like this.

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:49.465
Even if you move, it won't hurt.

00:16:00.985 --> 00:16:04.145
See? It doesn't hurt.

00:16:30.025 --> 00:16:30.865
DUTCHMILL

00:16:31.785 --> 00:16:33.145
What are you doing?

00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:35.345
Sit down.

00:16:36.145 --> 00:16:37.425
I just wanted to drink it.

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:41.145
I just put it in the fridge.
Let it chill for a bit longer.

00:16:42.265 --> 00:16:43.305
Fine.

00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:51.705
Just watch. No need to help.

00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:55.705
The doctor took the cast off already.
I can help now.

00:16:56.665 --> 00:16:59.385
They just removed it yesterday,
and you're already acting tough?

00:17:15.065 --> 00:17:16.985
Pie's coming to the restaurant today.

00:17:18.464 --> 00:17:19.424
I remember.

00:17:26.464 --> 00:17:28.424
I love you
more than anything in this world.

00:17:29.545 --> 00:17:32.585
What? Where did that come from?

00:17:33.745 --> 00:17:35.945
I just don't want you to worry about Pie.

00:17:40.945 --> 00:17:42.825
I'm not worried anymore.

00:17:42.905 --> 00:17:45.105
I know you love me.

00:17:45.185 --> 00:17:46.985
I thought you might be upset.

00:17:50.705 --> 00:17:52.305
I love you, Lin.

00:17:54.545 --> 00:17:56.225
So, so much.

00:17:57.025 --> 00:17:59.105
I waited for you for eight years,

00:18:00.825 --> 00:18:03.825
not even knowing when you'd come back.

00:18:06.865 --> 00:18:08.425
When you left for the US,

00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:12.185
I waited every day for you to call,

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.625
for a whole year.

00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:17.065
And I never gave up.

00:18:21.345 --> 00:18:22.985
Happy birthday, Jane.

00:18:23.065 --> 00:18:24.745
I hope you're really happy.

00:18:24.825 --> 00:18:28.225
How are you this year?
This year's been crazy.

00:18:28.305 --> 00:18:30.705
I've been adjusting, in and out of class…

00:18:30.785 --> 00:18:32.025
I miss you.

00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:51.585
Yes, I understand.

00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:54.625
I won't contact her again.

00:19:02.065 --> 00:19:03.905
Honestly, I feel guilty.

00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:06.585
I told Lin not to call Jane.

00:19:09.745 --> 00:19:11.465
You felt bad for Jane, didn't you?

00:19:17.785 --> 00:19:19.505
You know,

00:19:20.105 --> 00:19:23.585
Jane completely fell apart.
She couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.

00:19:23.665 --> 00:19:25.265
All she did was cry.

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:27.705
Does Jane know

00:19:27.785 --> 00:19:31.145
that Lin tried to contact her?

00:19:31.225 --> 00:19:33.705
No. I never told her.

00:19:33.785 --> 00:19:36.545
If they reconcile,
you're gonna be exposed for sure.

00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:39.585
Ugh. I know…

00:19:43.185 --> 00:19:45.865
If there hadn't been that accident
and you hadn't hurt her hand,

00:19:45.945 --> 00:19:47.945
I never would've gotten
to eat at Jane's restaurant

00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:52.545
Her place is always packed.
It's hard to squeeze into the schedule.

00:19:58.785 --> 00:20:00.905
Excuse me, your food has arrived.

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:04.865
Thank you.

00:20:08.145 --> 00:20:10.825
Let me see your hand.

00:20:20.305 --> 00:20:21.705
Is that the one?

00:20:21.785 --> 00:20:24.225
Of course, that's definitely her.

00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:29.425
The cast's removed, but it still hurts
a little when I move it.

00:20:30.785 --> 00:20:33.865
Once it's fully healed, you have to
shoot the cover for me again, okay?

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:41.145
The doctor said no touching,
it might cause inflammation.

00:20:42.465 --> 00:20:44.025
But Lin said it doesn't hurt anymore.

00:20:44.105 --> 00:20:46.105
Even if it doesn't, still no touching.

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.385
The food will be out shortly.

00:20:59.945 --> 00:21:01.265
Oh, hell no.

00:21:01.785 --> 00:21:03.945
That girl is a certified script body.

00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:06.905
What the hell is a "script body"?

00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:08.985
Trash, basically.

00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:10.465
Are you insulting me?

00:21:10.545 --> 00:21:13.545
Not you! But you need to tell Jane.

00:21:16.305 --> 00:21:17.425
What's going on?

00:21:18.225 --> 00:21:20.625
Jane, you need to hear
what Bam has to say.

00:21:21.625 --> 00:21:23.385
Tell me later. Let's finish serving first.

00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:25.225
No. This can't wait.

00:21:25.305 --> 00:21:26.385
Exactly.

00:21:26.465 --> 00:21:27.705
Why can't it wait?

00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:33.465
Because it's about
that woman sitting outside with Lin.

00:21:33.545 --> 00:21:34.585
Exactly.

00:21:42.785 --> 00:21:44.225
She's everywhere.

00:21:44.305 --> 00:21:45.625
She has a lot of friends?

00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:48.185
She's a scammer.

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:51.025
She brings a different guy
to dinner every day.

00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:53.705
My server friend said

00:21:53.785 --> 00:21:56.465
this woman is a total flirt.

00:21:56.545 --> 00:21:58.985
The guys she brings are all high rollers.

00:21:59.065 --> 00:22:02.545
They said she always
pitches some kind of project.

00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:04.305
At first it seems professional,

00:22:04.385 --> 00:22:06.945
but then it turns into
touching and flirting.

00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:10.465
She must be trying to catch rich men.

00:22:10.545 --> 00:22:11.985
All men?

00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:14.745
Women too, but mostly men.

00:22:15.465 --> 00:22:17.785
So she's into anyone?

00:22:17.865 --> 00:22:19.985
As long as they've got money.

00:22:22.185 --> 00:22:25.225
That's spicy.

00:22:25.305 --> 00:22:26.225
If you're free--

00:22:26.305 --> 00:22:27.345
She's not.

00:22:27.425 --> 00:22:28.865
Lin has to help me with work.

00:22:32.265 --> 00:22:34.265
What do you have to help Jane with?

00:22:35.305 --> 00:22:36.625
Photoshoots.

00:22:37.225 --> 00:22:42.265
Photos? Of Jane?

00:22:43.185 --> 00:22:44.345
Of the food menu.

00:22:44.425 --> 00:22:46.905
But you're not a food photographer.

00:22:47.705 --> 00:22:50.625
Wouldn't it be better
to find someone experienced?

00:22:51.505 --> 00:22:54.185
If you don't know anyone,
I can find someone.

00:22:54.785 --> 00:22:56.425
No one else would do.

00:22:58.865 --> 00:23:00.705
Lin's exactly who I want.

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:20.865
What's going on?!

00:23:20.945 --> 00:23:22.185
What's happening?!

00:23:35.785 --> 00:23:36.825
Jane.

00:23:38.385 --> 00:23:39.425
Jane.

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:41.865
Jane!

00:23:44.265 --> 00:23:46.425
Someone call an ambulance!

00:23:46.505 --> 00:23:48.585
-Jane!
-Jane!

00:23:48.665 --> 00:23:49.985
Jane!

00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:51.425
Jane!

00:23:52.225 --> 00:23:53.265
Jane!

00:23:53.785 --> 00:23:55.105
Jane!

00:23:56.065 --> 00:23:57.185
Jane!

00:24:29.945 --> 00:24:31.785
Are you okay, Lin?

00:24:38.465 --> 00:24:39.825
I'm fine.

00:24:40.425 --> 00:24:42.105
I'm more worried about you.

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:46.585
You were bleeding so much.

00:24:52.225 --> 00:24:53.945
Lie down and stay with me.

00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:18.025
I'll be alright.

00:25:19.305 --> 00:25:21.265
I'll be here to hold you till we're old.

00:25:41.745 --> 00:25:44.665
Will the person who did this
come back again?

00:25:45.425 --> 00:25:46.865
I don't know.

00:25:48.905 --> 00:25:52.425
Then you need to be careful
until we know who it was.

00:25:53.225 --> 00:25:55.025
Probably just some hooligans.

00:25:57.425 --> 00:25:58.545
You need to report it.

00:26:00.545 --> 00:26:01.425
Jane!

00:26:06.305 --> 00:26:07.745
How are you?

00:26:10.665 --> 00:26:11.985
I think I was sleeping too deeply.

00:26:12.065 --> 00:26:13.785
Don't sleep so deeply.

00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:18.105
Where does it hurt?

00:26:19.305 --> 00:26:20.185
Here.

00:26:21.385 --> 00:26:23.225
But you're okay now, right?

00:26:25.025 --> 00:26:27.105
Hello, Auntie Aom.

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.385
How are you, dear?

00:26:28.465 --> 00:26:29.625
I'm okay now.

00:26:29.705 --> 00:26:30.545
Alright.

00:26:31.745 --> 00:26:33.425
Who told you and--

00:26:33.505 --> 00:26:34.465
Pete called me.

00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:48.305
Tim?

00:27:06.185 --> 00:27:07.785
What are these flowers? They're cute.

00:27:11.145 --> 00:27:12.545
Lilies have tiny flowers like these?

00:27:20.065 --> 00:27:22.705
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
TIM

00:27:23.305 --> 00:27:25.025
You're not going to tell
your business partner

00:27:25.105 --> 00:27:26.545
someone threw a rock at the restaurant?

00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:28.585
We'll have to close for a couple of days.

00:27:30.585 --> 00:27:31.545
Hey,

00:27:32.585 --> 00:27:34.105
I'm not worried about the restaurant.

00:27:35.105 --> 00:27:36.105
I'm worried about you.

00:28:20.785 --> 00:28:21.785
Well,

00:28:21.865 --> 00:28:23.265
I'll go to the bathroom.

00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:27.585
Come, I'll--

00:28:27.665 --> 00:28:29.145
I'll help her.

00:28:46.905 --> 00:28:48.585
Aren't you going to talk to your daughter?

00:28:49.985 --> 00:28:51.305
I'll talk later, at home.

00:28:51.385 --> 00:28:52.345
Alright.

00:28:52.865 --> 00:28:53.905
Okay.

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:02.145
You want to ask about Tim, don't you?

00:29:02.745 --> 00:29:03.825
Oh.

00:29:04.345 --> 00:29:05.705
Aren't you going to the bathroom?

00:29:06.505 --> 00:29:07.585
Nope.

00:29:07.665 --> 00:29:09.625
I'd rather answer your questions.

00:29:14.865 --> 00:29:15.785
Who is Tim?

00:29:17.585 --> 00:29:18.625
My business partner.

00:29:18.705 --> 00:29:20.385
I already knew that.

00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:22.985
Oh? So what do you want to know?

00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:27.585
What's your relationship with him?

00:29:28.945 --> 00:29:30.185
Friends.

00:29:32.305 --> 00:29:35.665
But from the flowers at the restaurant,
it seems like more.

00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:39.025
An anniversary bouquet.

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:42.665
Anniversary of the restaurant.

00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:46.505
It opened on the 15th.

00:29:47.105 --> 00:29:49.985
He sends flowers
on the 15th of every month.

00:29:54.385 --> 00:29:55.665
But if he doesn't like you,

00:29:56.505 --> 00:29:58.345
why would he send them every month?

00:30:00.105 --> 00:30:01.625
I don't know about his side.

00:30:03.505 --> 00:30:06.025
But for me, my girlfriend is right here.

00:30:06.665 --> 00:30:09.065
Why would I care about anyone else?

00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:20.225
Be careful.

00:30:31.625 --> 00:30:33.105
Alright.

00:30:33.185 --> 00:30:36.185
Jane, Auntie Aom and I
are heading out now.

00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:39.345
Lin, come with us.

00:30:39.425 --> 00:30:41.345
I need to talk to you.

00:30:51.025 --> 00:30:52.225
Lin.

00:30:55.865 --> 00:30:59.265
Have you spoken with Kate
since this happened?

00:31:02.985 --> 00:31:04.025
No.

00:31:06.665 --> 00:31:08.225
She didn't call?

00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:13.705
No.

00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:18.865
She didn't call, or you didn't pick up?

00:31:21.225 --> 00:31:23.185
Why should I pick up?

00:31:23.265 --> 00:31:25.305
There's nothing left to talk about.
From what I've seen,

00:31:25.385 --> 00:31:27.305
there's nothing left to explain.

00:31:29.185 --> 00:31:30.665
I know

00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:33.545
it's hard at first,

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:37.105
but over time, anger can fade.

00:31:37.185 --> 00:31:40.225
When it does,
you might be ready to listen.

00:31:40.305 --> 00:31:41.305
Mom,

00:31:42.065 --> 00:31:44.145
maybe one day I'll forgive Kate.

00:31:44.665 --> 00:31:47.865
But I'll never understand
how she could do that to me.

00:31:50.145 --> 00:31:53.505
I'm sorry I disappointed you
and upset you with my decision, Mom.

00:31:54.025 --> 00:31:56.305
But I will never get back with Kate.

00:32:40.945 --> 00:32:42.385
I'm sorry

00:32:42.465 --> 00:32:45.265
I can't be the daughter you're proud of.

00:33:06.105 --> 00:33:08.025
Why are you still here? Go home.

00:33:09.865 --> 00:33:12.265
I'll help run the restaurant for now.

00:33:12.905 --> 00:33:14.265
No need.

00:33:17.065 --> 00:33:19.945
It's just a head wound,
not a brain injury.

00:33:20.025 --> 00:33:21.465
I can still work.

00:33:22.785 --> 00:33:24.425
How are you supposed to work?

00:33:24.505 --> 00:33:26.465
The doctor told you to rest for a week.

00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:34.145
Don't worry. I'll get the glass fixed

00:33:34.945 --> 00:33:37.785
and reschedule the customers.

00:33:40.265 --> 00:33:41.585
Then I'll leave it to you.

00:33:43.025 --> 00:33:44.105
You can leave anything to me.

00:33:45.705 --> 00:33:47.545
Then go do what you need to do.

00:33:55.705 --> 00:33:57.465
I've waited for you for years.

00:33:59.825 --> 00:34:03.265
And I've told you
so many times not to wait.

00:34:05.145 --> 00:34:06.425
But you don't have anyone.

00:34:06.505 --> 00:34:07.985
Even so,

00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:10.025
I still don't like you.

00:34:10.905 --> 00:34:13.105
We're just friends.

00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:15.425
You can't change that.

00:34:19.304 --> 00:34:21.065
And I want to tell you,

00:34:21.665 --> 00:34:25.185
no matter what you say,
you can't change how I feel either.

00:34:37.145 --> 00:34:38.225
I'll go.

00:34:45.784 --> 00:34:47.145
Lin.

00:34:48.304 --> 00:34:49.304
Jane.

00:35:47.785 --> 00:35:48.785
I know

00:35:48.865 --> 00:35:52.385
living to make Mom proud is one thing.

00:35:53.145 --> 00:35:56.105
But I want to live
in a way I'm proud of too.

00:35:56.945 --> 00:36:00.545
You said you don't want to go home.
Where will you stay?

00:36:06.865 --> 00:36:08.385
I don't know yet.

00:36:12.425 --> 00:36:14.505
How long can you keep running away?

00:36:14.585 --> 00:36:18.505
Problems are meant to be solved. Will you
run from your mom your whole life?

00:36:29.305 --> 00:36:31.225
You can't stop being her daughter.

00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:35.705
You're her daughter.
You have to go back and face it.

00:36:38.385 --> 00:36:39.585
Even if you run away,

00:36:39.665 --> 00:36:42.705
the problem's still there
until it's fixed.

00:36:53.625 --> 00:36:56.945
I thought you were going to tell her
"It's okay to break up with Kate."

00:36:57.025 --> 00:37:00.705
"Being single doesn't kill anyone.
You have a job, you earn money."

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:01.865
But you.

00:37:02.385 --> 00:37:06.025
Ugh, we already talked about this.

00:37:06.985 --> 00:37:10.985
You're being a terrible mother, you know?

00:37:11.065 --> 00:37:13.025
Your child's life is her own.

00:37:14.025 --> 00:37:16.625
Our only job is to raise them with love

00:37:16.705 --> 00:37:19.785
and make sure they're not
a burden to society.

00:37:20.425 --> 00:37:21.665
That's it.

00:37:22.305 --> 00:37:23.825
That's it, Aom.

00:37:25.905 --> 00:37:27.385
Do you want to know

00:37:27.465 --> 00:37:30.225
why I asked Lin to think again about Kate?

00:37:31.705 --> 00:37:33.025
Then tell me.

00:37:37.385 --> 00:37:39.025
Read this.

00:37:47.505 --> 00:37:49.945
I have one more favor to ask.

00:37:52.265 --> 00:37:53.305
What is it?

00:37:56.145 --> 00:37:57.945
Can you stop seeing Pie?

00:38:00.865 --> 00:38:01.825
Are you jealous?

00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:03.305
A little.

00:38:05.825 --> 00:38:07.185
Mostly concerned.

00:38:09.705 --> 00:38:10.945
About what?

00:38:11.465 --> 00:38:14.785
I heard she often goes out to eat

00:38:15.945 --> 00:38:17.785
with both women and men.

00:38:22.385 --> 00:38:23.945
Maybe she's just networking.

00:38:25.705 --> 00:38:27.225
I think it's more than that.

00:38:29.545 --> 00:38:31.145
Please stay away from her.

00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:38.385
I can't.

00:38:47.105 --> 00:38:49.025
I don't have a choice.

00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:58.345
I got fired from my job in New York, Jane.

00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:03.945
Why didn't you say anything?

00:39:08.105 --> 00:39:09.985
I was embarrassed.

00:39:10.065 --> 00:39:11.985
Why?

00:39:15.025 --> 00:39:18.865
I used to be successful,

00:39:18.945 --> 00:39:20.905
but now I've lost everything.

00:39:21.665 --> 00:39:24.425
I just want a way out

00:39:24.505 --> 00:39:27.025
where people won't look down on me.

00:39:28.385 --> 00:39:30.385
I don't want Mom to think

00:39:30.465 --> 00:39:32.665
I can't support her.

00:39:35.225 --> 00:39:38.225
Pie is the best option I have right now.

00:39:42.025 --> 00:39:45.425
If I come back
and get into a big-name magazine,

00:39:47.465 --> 00:39:50.305
it'll be a good reason to return.

00:39:57.225 --> 00:39:59.265
Who are you doing this for?

00:40:02.585 --> 00:40:04.985
For strangers on social media?

00:40:10.145 --> 00:40:11.465
Or for Aunt Aom?

00:40:14.225 --> 00:40:16.625
What's done is done.
You have to accept it.

00:40:19.625 --> 00:40:22.065
And start again with what makes you happy.

00:40:26.745 --> 00:40:28.625
If you're still happy taking pictures,

00:40:29.465 --> 00:40:30.985
keep doing it.

00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:34.905
Do it without comparing yourself.

00:40:38.585 --> 00:40:42.145
Life goes up and down.

00:40:43.185 --> 00:40:45.145
But find a way to be happy
even when it's down,

00:40:47.065 --> 00:40:48.585
not like this.

00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:58.865
No matter what you decide,
I'll be here with you.

00:41:23.425 --> 00:41:25.505
Oh, hello, Mr. Tim.

00:41:25.585 --> 00:41:26.665
Hello.

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:28.945
Have the police left?

00:41:29.025 --> 00:41:30.465
Yes, they're gone.

00:41:31.305 --> 00:41:33.425
I think we need to install
more cameras inside.

00:41:33.945 --> 00:41:35.465
Outside is not enough.

00:41:35.545 --> 00:41:37.305
I'll talk to Jane about it.

00:41:38.065 --> 00:41:39.225
Okay.

00:41:40.985 --> 00:41:42.785
Did you call the glass shop yet?

00:41:43.785 --> 00:41:46.785
They said they'd come measure

00:41:46.865 --> 00:41:48.905
and get back to us.

00:41:48.985 --> 00:41:50.905
They're super busy. It should take

00:41:50.985 --> 00:41:53.145
about a week.

00:41:53.745 --> 00:41:55.025
A week.

00:41:58.985 --> 00:42:02.265
Hello, Mr. Tim.

00:42:03.545 --> 00:42:05.825
I've already called the customers

00:42:05.905 --> 00:42:07.985
and rearranged next week's reservations

00:42:08.065 --> 00:42:10.945
like you asked.

00:42:13.025 --> 00:42:14.105
Thanks.

00:42:18.665 --> 00:42:21.425
Actually, I wanted
to ask you both something.

00:42:22.025 --> 00:42:23.345
Yes?

00:42:26.385 --> 00:42:29.745
I want to know who Lin is.

00:42:49.665 --> 00:42:50.865
Lin.

00:42:52.945 --> 00:42:54.185
Are you alright?

00:42:57.145 --> 00:42:58.865
Come sit here.

00:43:08.265 --> 00:43:09.105
What's wrong?

00:43:09.825 --> 00:43:10.785
Smile.

00:43:16.625 --> 00:43:18.465
A real smile.

00:43:27.785 --> 00:43:30.105
Give your girlfriend a smile.

00:43:55.185 --> 00:43:56.545
Here too.

00:44:07.265 --> 00:44:08.545
And here.

00:44:16.425 --> 00:44:17.545
Where else?

00:44:23.865 --> 00:44:25.105
Here.

00:45:02.905 --> 00:45:04.345
Anywhere else?

00:45:11.425 --> 00:45:12.265
That's enough,

00:45:14.025 --> 00:45:15.625
it'll turn into something
more than a kiss.

00:45:23.465 --> 00:45:25.065
It took you a long time to laugh.

00:45:31.425 --> 00:45:32.625
I just

00:45:33.545 --> 00:45:35.225
want to see you smile.

00:45:36.545 --> 00:45:37.785
Thank you.

00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:44.105
You're my little bundle of joy.

00:46:03.665 --> 00:46:04.705
Are you okay?

00:46:26.585 --> 00:46:29.105
Go wait at home first. I'll catch up.

00:46:30.265 --> 00:46:31.905
Stay away from Lin,

00:46:31.985 --> 00:46:34.305
no matter if it's about
work or investments.

00:46:34.385 --> 00:46:37.025
Or I'll testify
where all of this really came from.

00:46:37.105 --> 00:46:39.465
That's defamation, unless you have proof.

00:46:41.625 --> 00:46:44.145
You've always inspired me.

00:46:44.225 --> 00:46:46.025
I wanted to cook for someone I love.

00:46:46.105 --> 00:46:48.905
I wanted to open a restaurant
with food so good,

00:46:48.985 --> 00:46:51.745
that one day, if you ever wanted
to eat at my restaurant,

00:46:51.825 --> 00:46:53.385
I would see you again.

00:47:22.665 --> 00:47:24.945
