[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.979
[Episode 30]

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.759
I heard

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.600
she later remarried a merchant,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.780
who is said to be

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.200
one of the biggest merchants in Chang'an.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.150
Could it be He Bi?

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.420
He Bi also serves
as the president of An Society.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.120
The status matches.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.400
But she has moved back
to her parents' home.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.920
They couldn't have divorced, could they?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.790
I'm not sure about that.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.310
However,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.950
tomorrow I can visit the Wei Mansion again

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.550
to gather more information.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.919
Strictly speaking,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.639
we shouldn't be prying,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.310
but I have a feeling

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.640
it's related to our case.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.170
Thank you, then.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.280
Also,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.520
I went to the south of the city today.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.640
I remember you told me

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.490
your family has a villa there.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.910
Is it rented out?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.360
No.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.040
Do you remember Little Yang Ji?

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.120
I had him stay there to study

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.840
and look after the place.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.520
Sometimes he grows vegetables in the yard.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.720
He sent over two large baskets
just yesterday.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.910
Yang Ji?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.850
Just tell him

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.290
a tall, handsome gentleman

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.890
gave you a delivery fee

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.720
and asked you to deliver it.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.160
You need that villa?

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.000
Not exactly.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.520
But I might need to borrow
the person there.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.120
Greetings, Official Lu.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.520
It's unbelievable.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.420
You've grown so tall.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.310
[Yang Ji]

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.110
Miss Xijun left the entire villa

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.190
in my care.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.280
There's plenty of food,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.630
and I can sell the vegetables for extra.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.360
That's why I've grown so strong

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.150
so quickly.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.260
If I ever go to war,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.560
would you like to come with me?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.240
Yes!

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.079
As long as Miss Xijun agrees,

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.480
I'll go with you anytime.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.000
You mentioned you had a task for me.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.150
It's not going to
the House of Sorrow again, is it?

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.630
I'm grown up now.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.680
Going to such places

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.000
and dealing with women...

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.130
It's not the House of Sorrow this time.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.050
There's a larger villa

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.360
about 100 zhang from here.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.470
It's being expanded. Do you know about it?

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.530
It's An Society's. Who doesn't know?

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.590
They're loaded.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:44.840
Do you know

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.290
anyone who works there?

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.700
I can't be bothered

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.280
with An Society's lackeys.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.310
But I do know

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.550
the laborers there.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.230
I always send the vegetables

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.820
I can't sell or eat to them.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.040
That's perfect.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.630
When you deliver veggies tomorrow,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.960
pick the freshest ones.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.700
And while you're there,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.840
gather some information for me.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.520
Okay.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.320
[Mortuary of Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.190
Senior.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.920
Lingfeng.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.510
No need for explanations between us.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.270
Old guy.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.920
So you really are
hiding in the Earth God Temple.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.580
Let's see where you can go now.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.360
Old guy, I can see you.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.310
Come out, old guy!

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.670
Didn't expect this, did you?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.800
That's what they call
"while the priest climbs a foot"

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.390
"the devil climbs ten."

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.930
Who are you? State your name!

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:58.680
I am the Chicken Master of Tang,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.800
Fei Qiao, courtesy name Yingjun.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.120
I'm your Grandpa Fei!

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.240
Such a nobody!

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.320
How dare you act senior before me?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.390
I've been in the Ghost Market for decades.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.830
How come I've never seen you?

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.800
That's because you're too young.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.270
During those decades
you were in the Ghost Market,

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.710
I was running my cane shop up

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.840
above,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.820
too busy to come down.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.990
Enough talk!

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.800
You're...

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.410
with the county office, aren't you?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.560
You want to hold me accountable?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.810
You're still too green.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.430
See this?

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.540
This is Fengli cane.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.700
If I point it at you,

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.870
you'll vanish into dust.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.260
I don't believe a word!

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.240
You don't believe me? Let's try it.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.360
Point!

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.530
One more time!

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.160
Looks like you're the one
vanishing into dust.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.470
This was soaked in Fengli beast's urine,

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.130
but it's completely useless.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.510
I'll hit you to death!

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.400
Lady!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.200
Keep running and you'll lose your head!

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.870
I won't run! I won't run!

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.730
I won't run.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.630
Put Mr. Fei down now!

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.210
In the past three days,

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.920
we found one body each in

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.010
Xingdao District, Shanhe District,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.120
Chonghua District, Da'an District,
Anren District,

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.480
and Anyi District.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.669
Their identities have been confirmed—

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.440
missing merchants from earlier cases.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.600
Together with Hua Fu,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.200
Ma Kui, and He Qian,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.510
there are nine bodies in total.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.040
I've brought them all back.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.030
Tell me what you found
from examining the bodies first.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.210
Except for Ma Kui and He Qian,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.390
who died in unusual ways,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.940
the other 7 were all killed

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.630
by a heavy blow to the back of the head.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.120
Also,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.270
all bodies found in Chang'an County

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.270
were struck

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.930
twice,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.000
and for each body,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.000
one of the strikes
was from something very sharp.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.600
But the bodies found in Wannian County

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.080
were hit by a relatively flat,

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.290
heavy object—

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.030
killed with a single blow.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:26.870
Clearly,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.420
the killer used greater force.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.210
I've found something too.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.260
It's about Jinguang Society.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.790
Lu Lingfeng! Su Wuming!

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.200
Come get your delivery!

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.000
Hurry up!

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200
Hurry!

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.000
Hurry up!

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.750
Fei!

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.590
What are you doing?

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.390
This old man is over 100 years old.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.720
He's a rare centenarian in Chang'an.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.480
How can you treat him like this?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.040
Untie him.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:59.550
Hurry!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.530
Alright!

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.960
He may be
over a hundred years younger than me,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.420
but if it were one‑on‑one,

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.920
I'd definitely beat him.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.150
Bring the hemp rope!

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.750
Fei! Sit down.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.600
What a pity.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.160
That beautiful but wicked lady

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.840
turns out to be his accomplice.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.300
Who are you talking about?

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.370
You are beautiful.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.610
See? This old guy

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.730
has been brought to the county office,

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.790
yet he still dares to harass Yingtao.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.910
This man has confessed.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.230
Six months ago,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.200
he sold

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.620
a Fengli beast to a woman.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.720
You'll need to draw a portrait of her

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.180
based on his description.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.630
Alright.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.180
Describe that woman's appearance
truthfully.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.510
If you dare play tricks,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.080
my dagger...

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.740
will fly out at any moment!

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.810
It would be spinning in circles

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.630
and aimed straight at your head!

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.960
No, no, no! Don't!

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.990
I'll talk. I'll talk.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.080
I never expected this.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.660
That little beggar Yang Ji

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.790
turned out to be so useful.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.320
I was intending
to disguise myself as a laborer

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.630
to infiltrate the Jinguang Society,

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.790
but I feared
being exposed and alerting them.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.000
So I sent Yang Ji instead.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.480
And now,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.670
the picture is getting clearer.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.390
It's just that…

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.200
Let me say it for you.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.790
It's just that the truth

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.080
is heading toward

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.200
the last place we want it to.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.080
Wuming, Lu Lingfeng.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.870
Xijun.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.930
You finished that fast?

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.840
No need to draw.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.410
I already know who it is.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.970
Lu Lingfeng,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.230
you saw her a few days ago—

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.320
it's Juniang.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.880
I just remembered something too.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.390
That day I went to Wei Mansion

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.510
with Xijun,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.720
I smelled

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.150
a very distinct fragrance.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.320
When I asked,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.780
my female disciple,

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.750
Juniang,

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.900
said it was just ordinary sandalwood.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.080
But it didn't

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.510
smell ordinary at all.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.320
Now that I think about it,

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.320
it must've been sandalwood

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.910
mixed with the scent

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.440
of Fengli fluid from afar.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.140
Official Lu! Mr. Su!

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.960

We all work for the county office.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.320
Why didn't you come directly
to the west hall?

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.290
I came too early.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.420
I was afraid of disturbing your rest.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.360
Besides,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.120
I came to deliver invitations today.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.260
It seems more proper to do it here.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:29.960
Here.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.000
Tonight I'll prepare
a modest dinner at my humble home.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I sincerely hope

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.320
you'll honor us with your presence.

To view the Du family's
merit-record pillar?

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.910
An ancestral treasure

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.150
has been unearthed in your family too?

Congratulations!

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.480
But my background…

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.850
It doesn't matter.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.120
I'm not like that Wei

only my friends I value highly.

I've admired you for years.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.960
several bodies in Wannian County.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.840
I feel both ashamed and impressed.

You truly are Master Di's disciple.

I'm inviting you sincerely.

Recently, both the Wei and Du families'
merit-record pillars

were unearthed in the south of the city.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.370
I've been busy with official duties

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.630
and hadn't had a chance to host a banquet,

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.160
but Wei Tao beat me to it.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.250
He invited only the gentry.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.670
I, Du Yu,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.510
proud of my heritage as a member

of the Du family of Jingzhao,

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.550
am not so arrogant

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.090
as to socialize only with the gentry.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.840
That's why today all the people I invited

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.690
are the talents

You're too kind, Sheriff Du.

The wine of your Du family

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.080
is far better than the century‑old brew

of the Judicial Review Court.

he's a disciple of Master Di.

He has a promising future ahead.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.430
Come out and welcome him.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:06.160
[Ancestral Virtues and Legacy]

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.830
So this is his ancestor?

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.480
Looks ordinary.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.660
The painting is ordinary too.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.550
I'm sure I could buy something like this

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.440
in the Ghost Market for a few coins.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.030
Exactly.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.650
What do they have to be so proud of?

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.790
Sheriff Wei?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.510
Chen Chong invited you too?

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.350
Tie yourself up.
Don't wait for me to do it.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:43.960
Run!

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.630
Run!

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.440
Where do you think you're going?

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.680
Shi Qiansui

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.540
is a fifth-rank official
appointed by His Majesty!

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.150
What are you trying to do?

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.400
We're writing the word "gentry"

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.510
across Chang'an.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.030
Now,

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.720
we just need this final stroke
in Tongji District.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.660
I invited you here

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.690
to add that

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.930
final stroke.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.910
Let's fight them!

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.990
Mr. Taiqiu,

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.560
I'm Wei Tao.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.230
I'm Du Yu.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.340
Please forgive us
for shedding blood in the hall

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.480
to slay treacherous merchants.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:14.960
Stop!

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.220
Stop this at once!

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.590
Wei and Du,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.090
drop the weapons, now!

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.640
Are you really going to
make more mistakes?

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.000
Du Yu, you arranged this banquet

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.240
just to keep us occupied

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.660
so you could come here
and kill, didn't you?

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.110
Your scheme

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.770
isn't clever at all.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.770
Well, well, Du Yu.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.570
This has nothing to do with you.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.510
So you stalled me until now

00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.510
just so they could come

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.590
arrest me.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.770
Come on then! I, Wei Tao, fear nothing!

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.050
Saying that now...

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.920
are you trying

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.790
to paint me

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.750
as disloyal and unjust?

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.680
Enough talk!

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.510
I killed them all anyway.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.890
Draw your sword.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:18.920
Draw your sword!

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.550
Tao,

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:25.350
when we were kids,

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.750
I often quarreled with you.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.070
After we both became county sheriffs,

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.920
I even boasted

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.000
I'd eliminate you.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.360
That was only because

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.180
my sister married you.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.950
She raised me,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.440
and she's the one I loved most.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.800
I was just jealous.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.910
But ever since

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.200
we started searching
for the merit-record pillars together

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.130
and swore to wipe out

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.260
all villains of the Jinguang Society,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.290
I've seen you

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.230
as my big brother.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.550
And now,

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.440
how can you abandon me

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.960
and shoulder all this by yourself?

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.790
Du Yu!

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.640
Tao!

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.050
Lu Lingfeng is nothing

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.200
to be afraid of!

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.230
We can just work together,

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.480
take him down first,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.880
and then kill these two evil merchants!

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.240
W-wait, wait!

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.880
You're all gentry.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:22.880
What now?

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.100
You're going to use force now?

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.730
Three days ago, you found that Chen Chong

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.920
is from the Chen family of Yingchuan,

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.750
so you didn't kill him—

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.450
that was you, Du Yu, wasn't it?

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.390
It was me. So what?

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.120
Su Wuming, you were right.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.170
Du Yu has never killed anyone.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.870
All the evil merchants
of the Jinguang Society

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.500
were killed by me alone.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:49.640
Tao!

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.640
They tracked us here,

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.160
so they must have evidence already.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.310
Why do you

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.440
keep trying to take it all on yourself?

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.800
Actually, we don't have evidence.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.000
But Official Lu has sent people

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.830
to infiltrate the Jinguang Society

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.480
and gathered some information.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.810
Be careful! Don't damage it!

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.640
Make way! Make way!

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.590
Everyone, set aside

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.960
what you're doing for a moment!

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.490
I've brought you some wine!

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.480
Come on, have a drink.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.160
Come on.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:19.720
Is there more?

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.480
A month ago,

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.640
the Jinguang Society
was expanding their villa.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.000
While digging the foundation,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.590
they found two stone pillars

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.090
not far from each other.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.910
Experts later confirmed

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.590
that one is the Wei family's
merit-record pillar,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.960
and the other is the Du family's.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.090
Both are treasures.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.470
Those laborers
came from humble backgrounds,

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.830
but even they had heard the saying,

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.920
"South of the city live the Weis
and the Dus, only 5 feet from Heaven."

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.920
That's not right.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.120
Our Tang Empire's Chang'an

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.830
and the Sui Dynasty's Chang'an

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:46.960
are the same city.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.460
But the old site of Chang'an

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.680
before Sui and Tang lies to

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.940
the northwest of present‑day Chang'an.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.400
But the Jinguang Society's villa
in the south

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.960
shouldn't be far from the old Chang'an.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.590
It's not strange that

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.960
that area once held the old residences

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.530
of the Wei and Du families.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.300
Yang Ji, keep going.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.730
Not long after, the news spread.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.960
The Wei and Du families

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.690
each sent people to negotiate,

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.480
willing to pay
a high price to buy them back.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.300
Great.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.750
With their ancestors'
merit-record pillars,

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.350
their families
would gain even more prestige.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.720
Smash them!

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.660
He Bi,

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.670
you married Wei Jia.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.650
That makes you a son‑in‑law

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680
of the Wei family of Jingzhao.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.230
How could you do something like this?

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.810
Our Wei family has no such son‑in‑law!

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.070
Lu Lingfeng, I respect you.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.240
Su Wuming, I admire you.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.920
Gentlemen,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.080
please wait a moment.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.790
After I kill

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.520
these two evil merchants,

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.410
I will turn myself in!

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.720
The Yongzhou Judicial Official is present!

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.120
How dare you kill anyone!

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.420
Let's clarify what happened first.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.880
When returning them, He Bi ordered

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.160
a piece
of each family's merit-record pillar

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.350
to be cut off,

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.720
saying they would be used

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.070
to build stepping stones

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.000
for the Jinguang Society's villa.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.580
You two are clever.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.650
Seeing the merit-record pillars
incomplete,

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.620
you figured out why.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.160
So you sneaked into the Jinguang Society
at night

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.000
and took back the missing pieces.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.270
[Du]

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:28.630
[Du]

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.980
I believe

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.630
it was that night

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.030
that turned hostility
into peace between you.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.890
Our families are like brothers

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.050
and have never had grudges.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.440
What hostility?

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.200
Tao.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.660
Gentlemen.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.480
Destroying the merit-record pillars

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.000
was He Bi's doing alone.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.460
Why did you kill innocent people?

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.770
Innocent?

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.750
I'll say it again.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.310
I killed them all by myself.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.900
Du Yu had nothing to do with it.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.630
Du Yu,

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.610
although you've helped me before,

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.990
at most you are an accomplice.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.170
Put down your weapon now!

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.210
Ridiculous.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.450
Wei and Du families are one.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.040
We share glory and shame together.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.160
Moreover, you're my brother-in-law,

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.120
my lifelong role model.

for a long time, hasn't it?

Your wife, Du Juniang,
sought out famous doctors

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.420

that the old owner
had preserved for years.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.350
But because of its origin,

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.790
your wife
would surely find it unpalatable,

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.140
so she simply bought that Fengli beast

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.440
at a high price.
