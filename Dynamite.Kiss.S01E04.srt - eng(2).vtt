DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:55.910
Then why don't you prove to me
that this is indeed

00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:58.496
your lifeline?

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:24.457
Is this stupid piece of paper
that important?

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.960
You almost died just now.

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:28.878
You know that?

00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:31.798
I'm trying to live.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.426
I want to live.

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:37.512
I already told you.

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:39.973
These are not just pieces of paper.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.976
These are our livelihoods and lifelines.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.063
So don't just toss them
like they're nothing,

00:02:48.523 --> 00:02:49.607
and please read them over.

00:02:54.904 --> 00:02:56.197
Please.

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:03.413
EPISODE 4

00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:13.631
Checkmate.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:14.632
What?

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:18.636
I surrender.

00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:22.807
You really need to practice, Dad.
It's not fun winning all the time.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.559
I win a lot of things too, you know.

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:25.768
For example?

00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.604
In tickling wars!

00:03:28.688 --> 00:03:30.565
-Tickle, tickle!
-Stop!

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:33.317
You silly boy.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.072
Jun, what do you want for dinner?

00:03:38.573 --> 00:03:39.657
Dumplings!

00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:40.658
Dumplings.

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:42.285
Okay. Order received.

00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:04.390
Get in.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.226
No, I'm fine.
The bus stop is right over there.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.902
You can't ride a bus in that state.

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:17.153
Hurry up and get in.

00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:19.030
I'm really okay.

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:35.755
I'm fine.

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:38.132
Your coat will get wet.

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:41.552
I don't want you to get sick or whatever
and ask me to pay for your hospital bills.

00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:54.982
We'll arrive at your place in 15 minutes.

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:57.485
Use it to present your report.

00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:02.240
Wait, you want me to present
26 pages in 15 minutes?

00:05:02.323 --> 00:05:03.658
Time is ticking.

00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:07.662
Right, okay. Where should I start?

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:12.750
First, we focused
on monitoring the changes

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:14.293
in the bottle materials and grip,

00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:17.630
the texture and shape of the nipple,
and the air vent function.

00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:20.967
Based on our research, we've concluded
that there are several metrics

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.346
in which our product excels
compared to other products in the market.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.514
Those include…

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:02.884
The content isn't bad.

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:04.802
But you said
the report is 26 pages, right?

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:05.761
Yes.

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:08.055
Let's cut it down to five.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.724
Why? That'd be a waste.

00:06:09.807 --> 00:06:12.101
A long report doesn't prove
you're good at your job.

00:06:12.185 --> 00:06:14.770
A good report seduces you.
It makes you want to learn more about it,

00:06:14.854 --> 00:06:16.772
see the product, and touch it.

00:06:17.982 --> 00:06:19.358
Even documents need to be sexy.

00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:21.736
Even documents need to be sexy…

00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:23.905
How do you do that?

00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:28.159
Hold on.

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:36.375
It was here somewhere.

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:38.252
Here it is.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.258
This is an old report I worked on.

00:06:44.342 --> 00:06:45.843
Use it as a reference.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.386
I see.

00:06:55.686 --> 00:06:57.813
Create a table for the comparison analysis
with the other companies' products

00:06:57.897 --> 00:06:58.814
you mentioned earlier.

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:00.399
Hang on. Okay.

00:07:00.483 --> 00:07:01.776
Create a table.

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:02.777
For the reviews,

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.154
quantify them and create a graph
showing the satisfaction level

00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:06.530
for each category.

00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:09.116
You want to be able to visualize the data
as much as possible

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.577
so it can be easily understood
at a glance.

00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:13.829
"Easily," "visualize."

00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:18.334
You really are a pro.

00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:19.710
That's nothing.

00:07:21.462 --> 00:07:24.590
I'll make the revisions
as soon as possible for your review.

00:07:25.174 --> 00:07:28.261
Thank you so much
for driving me home today.

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:30.429
I really hope

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:34.100
to see you at the office tomorrow.

00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:53.411
Hey, young lady.

00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:58.040
Are you Go Da-jeong's older sister?

00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:04.755
That would make you

00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:09.385
Go Da-rim, right?

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.576
YOU CAN DO IT
KEEP GOING!

00:08:35.828 --> 00:08:38.164
You really are a handful.

00:08:38.664 --> 00:08:39.790
This has got to be a joke.

00:08:42.918 --> 00:08:43.878
My goodness.

00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:45.963
That Ms. Go Da-rim you're looking for

00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:47.923
lives with the owner downstairs.

00:08:48.007 --> 00:08:51.636
I'm just the tenant who lives above her.

00:08:51.719 --> 00:08:52.720
You're not her?

00:08:52.803 --> 00:08:53.971
No, I'm not.

00:08:54.597 --> 00:08:56.265
It's not her. What's going on?

00:08:56.766 --> 00:08:59.393
It's not her!
She says it's not her! You little…

00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:05.775
-Then let me ask you something.
-Sure, go ahead.

00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:09.278
Has the landlord's family
been coming home recently?

00:09:15.034 --> 00:09:16.369
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:09:16.452 --> 00:09:18.954
Ms. Go Da-rim said

00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:22.917
she was going on a trip
far away to someplace overseas.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.835
-Overseas?
-Yeah.

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:26.045
She really set her mind to it.

00:09:26.921 --> 00:09:28.547
She fled overseas, you punk!

00:09:28.631 --> 00:09:30.049
-Hey, what have you been doing?
-Wait…

00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:32.760
-I'll get going now.
-Boss! Wait…

00:09:32.843 --> 00:09:35.137
-Apologies for disturbing you.
-No problem.

00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:36.639
Goodbye, ma'am.

00:09:36.722 --> 00:09:38.557
She fled overseas.
What have you two been doing?

00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:39.934
How are we going to catch her now?

00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:41.143
Ms. Go Da-rim!

00:09:42.728 --> 00:09:43.771
Ms. Go Da-rim!

00:09:43.854 --> 00:09:46.232
-You left your phone.
-Go Da-rim…

00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:47.942
-Ms. Go Da-rim.
-He said, "Go Da-rim."

00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:49.276
Who forgets their phone?

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.113
-Go…
-You're such a handful.

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:54.240
-She's Go Da-rim.
-Go Da-rim?

00:09:55.032 --> 00:09:56.701
-Her.
-You…

00:09:57.827 --> 00:09:58.661
Go Da-rim, you…

00:09:59.578 --> 00:10:01.247
You! Hey!

00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:02.915
-What? What's up?
-Run!

00:10:02.998 --> 00:10:04.166
-What's wrong?
-Run! Go!

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.292
Go Da-rim!

00:10:05.835 --> 00:10:07.378
-Go Da-rim, you…
-Run!

00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:15.344
Hey, Go Da-rim!

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:17.763
How dare you lie to me!

00:10:17.847 --> 00:10:19.223
You're dead meat!

00:10:26.397 --> 00:10:27.398
This way!

00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:28.524
-Isn't that Da-rim?
-Go Da-rim!

00:10:29.358 --> 00:10:30.276
Get her!

00:10:30.359 --> 00:10:32.194
-Get her!
-Stop right there, Go Da-rim!

00:10:32.278 --> 00:10:33.696
-What the hell?
-Go Da-rim!

00:10:38.784 --> 00:10:40.828
Hey, Go Da-rim! You…

00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:42.496
Just wait until I catch you!

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.498
Hey, Go Da-rim! You little…

00:10:45.124 --> 00:10:46.250
Move!

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.422
Go catch her! Go!

00:10:51.964 --> 00:10:53.799
Come here, Go Da-rim!

00:11:01.307 --> 00:11:03.726
Hold on, Da-rim. Oh jeez.

00:11:05.603 --> 00:11:06.437
Da-rim…

00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:08.522
Why are we running?

00:11:10.483 --> 00:11:11.901
Just run for now.

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:12.860
What's going on?

00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:15.613
Da-rim.

00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:20.826
Hey, Go Da-rim!

00:11:24.955 --> 00:11:27.208
Hey! Go Da-rim!

00:11:29.793 --> 00:11:31.170
Where the hell did she go?

00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:33.172
Hey, you go over there.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:34.840
-You go over there!
-Yes, sir.

00:11:34.924 --> 00:11:36.800
Just wait until I catch you. Damn it.

00:11:42.264 --> 00:11:43.390
I think we're going to get caught.

00:12:25.683 --> 00:12:28.352
Da-rim! Where are you going?

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.649
Damn it, Go Da-rim!

00:13:39.006 --> 00:13:40.215
Come here.

00:13:45.638 --> 00:13:47.014
Who the hell are you?

00:13:49.224 --> 00:13:50.517
I'm her boss.

00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:52.019
And who the hell are you?

00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:53.062
Me?

00:13:53.937 --> 00:13:55.272
I'm her husband.

00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:11.080
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

00:14:12.706 --> 00:14:14.291
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:14:19.213 --> 00:14:20.381
How did you…

00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:29.807
I'm sorry.

00:14:31.058 --> 00:14:32.351
I misunderstood the situation.

00:14:34.728 --> 00:14:35.562
It's all right.

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:37.106
I also made a mistake.

00:14:48.867 --> 00:14:51.453
I was worried
because this is my wife's first job.

00:14:51.537 --> 00:14:53.747
I'm glad that she found herself
such a good boss.

00:14:57.334 --> 00:15:00.045
I hope you continue
looking out for my Rim.

00:15:07.594 --> 00:15:08.887
Yes, sure.

00:15:12.016 --> 00:15:14.893
Mr. Gong, we'll get going now then.

00:15:14.977 --> 00:15:17.062
Thank you so much for today.

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.483
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.287
-Were they loan sharks?
-Yeah.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.913
We need to be careful.

00:15:35.873 --> 00:15:36.790
What's wrong?

00:15:36.874 --> 00:15:39.668
-Are you okay?
-It's still hurting where I sprained it.

00:15:39.752 --> 00:15:40.586
Hold on.

00:15:41.503 --> 00:15:42.629
Hop on.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.632
No, I'm fine.

00:15:45.716 --> 00:15:46.550
Hurry up.

00:15:47.051 --> 00:15:47.968
I'm fine though.

00:15:48.052 --> 00:15:49.386
Hurry up.

00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:52.639
-Come on.
-Okay.

00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:15.454
LOAN AGREEMENT
NAME: GO DA-JEONG

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:17.581
Da-rim, drink this and warm yourself up.

00:16:18.248 --> 00:16:19.374
Be careful, it's hot.

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:20.417
Thanks.

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:26.131
Where am I going to find 30 million won?

00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:28.509
It's illegal to demand repayment
from the family.

00:16:28.592 --> 00:16:29.927
Let's report this to the police.

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:35.099
What if reporting it
leads to further retaliation?

00:16:35.182 --> 00:16:38.227
Maybe I should just ask them nicely
if I can pay them back

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.812
in small installments.

00:16:39.895 --> 00:16:42.231
Da-rim, I guarantee
this won't end with 30 million.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.316
Look.

00:16:44.942 --> 00:16:46.276
With such a high interest rate,

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.071
your debt will grow faster
than your payments.

00:16:49.154 --> 00:16:50.531
Report it tomorrow morning,
no matter what.

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:54.451
Okay.

00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:00.749
You haven't eaten yet, right?

00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:03.168
Let's eat. I'll make you something.

00:17:03.252 --> 00:17:04.378
I have a lot of work.

00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:06.088
You still need to eat something.

00:17:06.171 --> 00:17:09.133
I don't have much of an appetite today.

00:17:09.758 --> 00:17:12.636
Hey, Jun must be waiting for you.
You should go upstairs.

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:13.846
Thanks for today.

00:17:16.723 --> 00:17:18.475
Okay. Get some rest.

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:19.393
Thanks.

00:17:23.063 --> 00:17:24.064
Unbelievable.

00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:25.691
"My Rim"?

00:17:25.774 --> 00:17:27.192
"My Rim"?

00:17:27.276 --> 00:17:29.361
If they love each other so much,
why did they even fight?

00:17:30.028 --> 00:17:32.489
He didn't even come after her
when she ran away to Jeju.

00:17:37.035 --> 00:17:38.745
Are you talking about that woman again?

00:17:41.165 --> 00:17:42.207
You scared me!

00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:46.336
-What are you doing here?
-I guess I just dozed off.

00:17:47.296 --> 00:17:49.840
I came because you were ignoring my calls.

00:17:49.923 --> 00:17:51.300
Did you receive the report?

00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:52.843
Yeah.

00:17:53.427 --> 00:17:54.386
Why did you send

00:17:55.304 --> 00:17:57.556
Ms. Go to do your job?

00:17:57.639 --> 00:18:00.142
I was summoned
and interrogated by Director Gong

00:18:00.726 --> 00:18:02.060
about why you weren't coming to work.

00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:04.521
-So?
-I told her you were on sick leave.

00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:07.858
I've run out of excuses,
so come to work starting tomorrow.

00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:10.277
I'm too embarrassed
to face the team members.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.321
They call you Mr. Freeloader

00:18:12.404 --> 00:18:14.698
because it looks like
you get paid to slack off.

00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:18.035
Anyway, that woman you met in Jeju…

00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:20.454
I mean, the mom. Did you see her again?

00:18:20.537 --> 00:18:22.664
Yeah. She was with her husband.

00:18:22.748 --> 00:18:24.124
Man.

00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:27.586
She was nowhere to be found
when you were desperately looking for her.

00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:29.504
And now, it seems like
you run into her everywhere.

00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:32.049
Does she live near here?
Or near the office?

00:18:32.132 --> 00:18:33.592
Why would I even care?

00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:35.677
Why are you so angry?

00:18:37.262 --> 00:18:38.931
Wait, don't tell me you're jealous.

00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:43.018
Did seeing her husband
tie your stomach in knots?

00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:45.395
What? Jealous?

00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:46.897
-Yeah.
-Who?

00:18:48.357 --> 00:18:49.566
-Me?
-Yes.

00:18:51.068 --> 00:18:52.110
How does that make any sense?

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.032
Having feelings for someone
never makes any sense.

00:18:57.115 --> 00:18:58.867
Even Shakespeare said,

00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:02.120
"Love is merely a madness."

00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:06.416
And it's a love
that can never come true, no less.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.627
How maddening it must be.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.671
Now,

00:19:10.754 --> 00:19:14.800
at times like these,
we must focus on work.

00:19:14.883 --> 00:19:17.844
You'll forget all about it
when you show up to work tomorrow

00:19:18.428 --> 00:19:20.430
and see the faces of your team members.

00:19:20.514 --> 00:19:21.348
Okay?

00:19:22.933 --> 00:19:23.976
I'm off.

00:19:29.564 --> 00:19:30.941
Seeing her face will help me forget her?

00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:33.777
It's only making me crazier.

00:19:40.158 --> 00:19:43.078
Even documents need to be sexy.

00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:46.832
It must make you want to see the product,
learn more about it,

00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:49.126
and touch…

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:02.014
No, this isn't right.

00:20:02.097 --> 00:20:04.349
There's no time to be distracted
by stuff like that.

00:20:04.433 --> 00:20:06.226
Okay, even documents need to be sexy…

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.185
No.

00:20:10.397 --> 00:20:11.940
Right, a graph.

00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:26.663
GYEONG-MIN

00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:29.291
You're up, right?

00:20:29.374 --> 00:20:30.751
Get ready for work.

00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:33.003
My whole body is aching.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.088
I think I overdid it yesterday.

00:20:35.172 --> 00:20:37.591
Did you pull a muscle
relaxing in your hotel room all day?

00:20:37.674 --> 00:20:40.969
If you don't show up today, I'm going to
bring the chairman and storm in there.

00:20:45.265 --> 00:20:48.393
I'll make the revisions
as soon as possible for your review.

00:20:48.477 --> 00:20:49.686
I really hope

00:20:50.312 --> 00:20:52.105
to see you at the office tomorrow.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.574
NATURAL BEBE
NEW BABY BOTTLE PRODUCT MONITORING REPORT

00:21:02.657 --> 00:21:03.533
PRODUCT INTRODUCTION

00:21:05.369 --> 00:21:07.746
Do you find it sexy?

00:21:12.751 --> 00:21:14.878
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:16.838
I wanted it to look sexy.

00:21:20.717 --> 00:21:21.593
Listen, Jun's mom.

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:24.012
That's no way for a mom to act.

00:21:25.263 --> 00:21:26.640
Do I look that easy to you?

00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:29.142
No, I just wanted to seduce you--

00:21:29.226 --> 00:21:31.937
Right, so why do you want to seduce me?

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.730
No, that's not what I meant.

00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:35.982
Not me. I wanted the report to seduce you.

00:21:37.859 --> 00:21:39.569
Remember what you told me last night?

00:21:39.653 --> 00:21:41.738
"A good report seduces you.
It makes you want to learn more about it,

00:21:41.822 --> 00:21:43.323
see the product, and touch it."

00:21:43.407 --> 00:21:45.325
"Even documents need to be sexy."

00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:48.161
I stayed up all night editing it.

00:21:55.919 --> 00:21:58.839
You should be clearer in your delivery.

00:21:58.922 --> 00:22:00.257
Are you trying to confuse me or what?

00:22:01.508 --> 00:22:02.509
I'm sorry.

00:22:10.016 --> 00:22:11.101
It's good enough.

00:22:11.893 --> 00:22:13.228
Thank goodness.

00:22:16.731 --> 00:22:19.359
You must've been quite shocked yesterday.

00:22:19.443 --> 00:22:21.778
I would've been in big trouble
if it hadn't been for you.

00:22:21.862 --> 00:22:23.113
Thank you so much.

00:22:23.822 --> 00:22:26.116
I promise I'll work really hard.

00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:29.161
-Don't get the wrong idea.
-Pardon?

00:22:29.244 --> 00:22:31.997
I only helped you yesterday
out of human decency.

00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:35.500
How I feel about you hasn't changed.

00:22:37.252 --> 00:22:38.920
Where's your resignation letter?

00:22:39.004 --> 00:22:41.339
I thought that issue was settled.

00:22:41.423 --> 00:22:42.716
Of course, it isn't.

00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:45.594
Seeing your perfectly fine husband
just pissed me off even more.

00:22:46.595 --> 00:22:48.013
Hand in your resignation immediately.

00:22:48.722 --> 00:22:49.806
Got it?

00:23:01.943 --> 00:23:04.029
Where am I going to find 30 million won?

00:23:15.624 --> 00:23:18.126
If, by any chance,
you change your mind, call me.

00:23:18.835 --> 00:23:21.254
The one thing I can guarantee
is that we will treat you

00:23:21.338 --> 00:23:23.757
with the utmost respect and courtesy
as an artist.

00:23:27.427 --> 00:23:30.722
It's surprisingly thorough
and well-organized.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.392
It also covers some points
we hadn't considered.

00:23:34.476 --> 00:23:35.393
In particular,

00:23:35.477 --> 00:23:39.105
the bottle's marking color
and grip suggestions

00:23:39.189 --> 00:23:40.357
can be implemented
and applied immediately.

00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:44.945
I guess these are the kind of
innovative tips and ideas

00:23:45.028 --> 00:23:47.113
that only our Mother TF Team
can come up with.

00:23:47.697 --> 00:23:49.366
Everyone loved it.

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:51.117
Well done.

00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:55.288
Especially Ms. Go's boiling
sterilization test and report revisions.

00:23:55.372 --> 00:23:56.581
Your all-nighters really paid off.

00:23:56.665 --> 00:24:00.877
With Da-rim's touch, the report
became really polished overnight.

00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:02.295
-I agree.
-It became super refined.

00:24:02.379 --> 00:24:04.339
I could never do that.

00:24:04.422 --> 00:24:07.092
Not at all. We all worked on it together.

00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:09.886
Thank you for your hard work as well,
Mr. Kang.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.680
Come on, I didn't do anything.

00:24:11.763 --> 00:24:12.681
You certainly did.

00:24:12.764 --> 00:24:15.225
You got us all those baby bottles
from our competitors,

00:24:15.308 --> 00:24:16.643
got us late-night snacks,

00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:18.186
and even stayed up with us.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.145
You're the best.

00:24:19.229 --> 00:24:22.691
I'd say you did much more
than someone who was never around

00:24:22.774 --> 00:24:24.401
and only showed up to submit it.

00:24:24.484 --> 00:24:26.528
Yeah, there are people like that.

00:24:26.611 --> 00:24:28.780
People who freeload and take credit
for their team members' hard work.

00:24:28.863 --> 00:24:31.825
Is that why
his nickname is "Mr. Freeloader"?

00:24:31.908 --> 00:24:34.911
I thought it was because
he was stingy or something.

00:24:34.995 --> 00:24:38.623
Not at all.
We owe all this success to Mr. Gong.

00:24:38.707 --> 00:24:40.750
He was the one who taught me the trick

00:24:40.834 --> 00:24:44.045
to summarize our 20-plus pages
into a 5-page report.

00:24:44.546 --> 00:24:46.339
-He did?
-Yes.

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:49.426
Then I guess he did pull some weight.

00:24:49.509 --> 00:24:50.635
Of course.

00:24:51.511 --> 00:24:53.763
Mr. Gong may sound
a bit abrasive at times,

00:24:53.847 --> 00:24:56.725
but he's actually a very warm person.

00:24:57.517 --> 00:24:58.935
Innate leadership!

00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:00.478
Deep affection for his employees.

00:25:01.313 --> 00:25:02.731
You witnessed it for yourself.

00:25:03.982 --> 00:25:05.233
Abrasive on the outside,
warm on the inside.

00:25:05.317 --> 00:25:06.401
I guess I agree.

00:25:06.484 --> 00:25:07.736
She agrees!

00:25:08.653 --> 00:25:10.030
We all agree!

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.790
The report was in such a dismal state

00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:23.376
that I had no choice but to intervene.

00:25:24.127 --> 00:25:25.712
However, this will be the last time.

00:25:26.713 --> 00:25:28.173
Please take care of your business,

00:25:28.965 --> 00:25:30.675
so I don't have to be disturbed.

00:25:32.344 --> 00:25:34.012
Don't bother me.

00:25:47.442 --> 00:25:48.610
Oh my gosh!

00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:59.704
Are you okay?

00:26:03.458 --> 00:26:04.667
Are you hurt?

00:26:26.981 --> 00:26:29.484
I thought about the exhibition
you mentioned last time.

00:26:30.485 --> 00:26:33.321
I put together a proposal
for the photography exhibition.

00:26:33.405 --> 00:26:34.322
To start,

00:26:34.823 --> 00:26:36.908
I did some research on a possible concept,

00:26:36.991 --> 00:26:40.036
mission statement, and exhibition design.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.540
Regarding exhibition design,
there could be three…

00:26:43.623 --> 00:26:45.125
Those gentle, doe eyes.

00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:46.793
That sharp nose.

00:26:47.377 --> 00:26:49.337
Those plump lips.

00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:52.590
All of that…

00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:00.890
Ms. Yu?

00:27:01.933 --> 00:27:03.393
Yes? Oh, right.

00:27:03.977 --> 00:27:04.853
Are you okay?

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:07.522
What's wrong with me?

00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:09.899
Why are you so handsome today?

00:27:13.027 --> 00:27:16.322
I came because I had a few questions
before making up my mind.

00:27:16.906 --> 00:27:19.409
First, regarding profit distribution--

00:27:19.492 --> 00:27:20.493
Ha-yeong.

00:27:20.577 --> 00:27:22.620
Chanal has new arrivals.
Let's go have a look.

00:27:23.496 --> 00:27:24.747
You're with a guest.

00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:28.626
This is Mr. Kim Seon-u, who will be
participating in our upcoming exhibition.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.671
And this is Ms. Han Mi-ok,
the director of the art hall.

00:27:33.256 --> 00:27:34.757
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Seon-u.

00:27:35.717 --> 00:27:37.760
What a shame.
The exhibition has been canceled.

00:27:38.344 --> 00:27:39.846
What? Why?

00:27:40.805 --> 00:27:41.890
Excuse us for a moment.

00:27:43.183 --> 00:27:44.017
What?

00:27:45.768 --> 00:27:48.313
What are you talking about?
You said you'd persuade Dad.

00:27:48.396 --> 00:27:50.190
I did because you said you'd do your best.

00:27:50.273 --> 00:27:52.525
But is this what you call doing your best?

00:27:53.568 --> 00:27:56.863
At the very least, you should bring
an artist with a name to the table.

00:27:56.946 --> 00:27:58.364
This is just insulting.

00:27:58.448 --> 00:28:00.074
You brought someone so insignificant.

00:28:00.658 --> 00:28:02.702
Mom, how could you say that?

00:28:02.785 --> 00:28:03.703
2025 TAEYU ART HALL
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION PROPOSAL

00:28:03.786 --> 00:28:05.747
I don't want third-rate artists.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.292
Wrap it up. I'm off to Chanal by myself.

00:28:19.761 --> 00:28:22.722
It appears coming here was a mistake.

00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:24.015
No, that's not--

00:28:24.098 --> 00:28:26.351
It looks like you're in trouble
because of me.

00:28:27.602 --> 00:28:28.436
I'm sorry.

00:28:29.979 --> 00:28:30.897
I'll be off then.

00:28:36.819 --> 00:28:40.198
I heard the report from Ji-hyeok's team
was quite useful.

00:28:41.324 --> 00:28:44.786
He may be snappy with his words,
but I guess he's still working hard.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.205
Well…

00:28:48.665 --> 00:28:49.499
Never mind.

00:28:49.582 --> 00:28:52.252
What is it? You can tell me anything.

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:56.381
The truth is,

00:28:56.464 --> 00:28:59.884
Ji-hyeok had been skipping work
without notice until yesterday.

00:29:00.552 --> 00:29:02.345
He even missed the submission deadline
for his report.

00:29:02.428 --> 00:29:04.055
He's having trouble with team management,

00:29:04.138 --> 00:29:06.182
so I've been paying
more attention to them.

00:29:06.266 --> 00:29:09.310
I can't tell if he's just a poor fit
or if he's struggling to adjust.

00:29:10.144 --> 00:29:11.563
As his older sister,

00:29:12.146 --> 00:29:13.439
I can't help but be concerned.

00:29:13.523 --> 00:29:14.566
Is that so?

00:29:15.316 --> 00:29:16.818
That's what that punk did?

00:29:22.031 --> 00:29:22.991
Did you call for me?

00:29:25.326 --> 00:29:28.872
You've only just started working,
and you're skipping work already?

00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:31.124
Do you think this is a joke?

00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:33.042
I completed

00:29:33.668 --> 00:29:35.962
the assigned task without any issues,
so what's the problem?

00:29:36.045 --> 00:29:37.797
Don't take your job
or this company lightly.

00:29:38.464 --> 00:29:41.426
Running a business isn't like consulting,

00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:43.720
where you can just
make it look good enough to pass.

00:29:43.803 --> 00:29:47.140
You must lead the organization responsibly
to achieve respectable results.

00:29:47.807 --> 00:29:49.642
Isn't securing the partnership
with Taeyu C&T,

00:29:51.895 --> 00:29:56.065
under the guise of an arranged marriage,
the result I'm expected to achieve?

00:29:57.108 --> 00:29:58.651
I don't recall any of this grandiose talk

00:29:58.735 --> 00:30:01.321
about the organization or its management
in the agreement.

00:30:01.404 --> 00:30:04.198
So what? You're just going to
keep this behavior up?

00:30:04.282 --> 00:30:05.909
You don't need to worry about that.

00:30:05.992 --> 00:30:07.827
I'll carry on the corporate employee act

00:30:08.703 --> 00:30:11.623
just enough to avoid Chairman Yu
hearing anything negative.

00:30:12.206 --> 00:30:14.292
I'm a man of my word.

00:30:15.835 --> 00:30:17.086
Unlike someone.

00:30:21.633 --> 00:30:22.508
You…

00:30:23.384 --> 00:30:25.219
Why that punk…

00:30:26.554 --> 00:30:27.889
Unbelievable.

00:30:40.485 --> 00:30:41.778
MY MOM

00:30:43.112 --> 00:30:44.113
Hey, Mom.

00:30:46.658 --> 00:30:47.575
Who is this?

00:30:51.746 --> 00:30:52.705
Mom.

00:30:53.456 --> 00:30:54.707
What happened?

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.960
It's nothing.

00:30:57.043 --> 00:30:58.878
You broke your leg. How is this nothing?

00:31:00.713 --> 00:31:04.300
I just fell down the stairs.
It was an accident.

00:31:05.051 --> 00:31:06.052
It was an accident, right?

00:31:07.637 --> 00:31:08.805
It really was an accident, right?

00:31:11.349 --> 00:31:12.433
It was.

00:31:13.142 --> 00:31:14.185
Don't worry.

00:31:16.312 --> 00:31:17.480
Are you hurt anywhere else?

00:31:17.563 --> 00:31:19.649
What about your arm? Is your arm okay?

00:31:19.732 --> 00:31:22.527
They said I was fine.
They ran all the tests.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.824
Mom.

00:31:29.742 --> 00:31:31.369
Do you know how scared I was?

00:31:42.255 --> 00:31:43.589
How?

00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:46.801
How could you do this?

00:31:46.884 --> 00:31:49.721
I didn't know she had the child.
I didn't even know she got pregnant.

00:31:50.346 --> 00:31:51.764
I only found out after she died.

00:31:53.433 --> 00:31:54.350
Is that an excuse?

00:31:54.434 --> 00:31:56.686
I truly loved you.

00:31:56.769 --> 00:31:58.604
It might've been an arranged marriage,

00:31:58.688 --> 00:32:02.775
but I respected and trusted you
as my husband and Ji-hyeok's father.

00:32:02.859 --> 00:32:04.819
So how could you bring that child here?

00:32:04.902 --> 00:32:06.112
Do you not care about Ji-hyeok?

00:32:06.195 --> 00:32:07.613
Then what was I supposed to do?

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:11.117
Do you remember?

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.911
You told me that if I took care
of your father's bankruptcy,

00:32:13.995 --> 00:32:15.538
you'd repay me somehow.

00:32:15.621 --> 00:32:17.248
I'll pay off that debt.

00:32:17.331 --> 00:32:19.083
So you repay me with this.

00:32:20.334 --> 00:32:21.544
You can't be serious.

00:32:24.422 --> 00:32:25.423
That was the first day

00:32:26.049 --> 00:32:28.176
I heard my mom cry.

00:32:29.969 --> 00:32:31.637
That's when I realized
she could actually cry,

00:32:33.014 --> 00:32:34.182
louder

00:32:34.849 --> 00:32:36.225
and more sorrowfully than me.

00:32:38.394 --> 00:32:41.355
It was the sound of the ground
beneath my feet crumbling away.

00:32:43.274 --> 00:32:44.317
After my sister arrived,

00:32:45.401 --> 00:32:47.070
my mom lost her smile.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.032
So it made me want to do everything well.

00:32:52.408 --> 00:32:55.578
I was willing to do anything
if it could make her smile.

00:32:55.661 --> 00:32:57.955
Mom, I got a medal in taekwondo.

00:33:05.797 --> 00:33:06.798
Mom?

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.805
Mom!

00:33:18.434 --> 00:33:19.519
Mom!

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.584
Really?

00:33:43.668 --> 00:33:45.211
Yeah.

00:33:45.753 --> 00:33:49.090
What did that team leader
who's been giving you a hard time say?

00:33:49.173 --> 00:33:51.008
When I brought my A-game,

00:33:51.092 --> 00:33:53.010
he was just stunned.

00:33:53.553 --> 00:33:56.514
I knew you were going to do well.

00:33:57.181 --> 00:33:58.808
Ever since you were a kid,

00:33:58.891 --> 00:34:01.310
you've always worked hard at everything,

00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:03.563
and you've always taken good care
of those around you.

00:34:04.647 --> 00:34:08.317
You were loved by all, wherever you went.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.404
-Was I?
-Yeah.

00:34:11.487 --> 00:34:12.572
You just wait and see.

00:34:12.655 --> 00:34:15.449
Even that team leader or whatever

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.161
will come to adore you.

00:34:18.244 --> 00:34:19.453
I knew it.

00:34:19.537 --> 00:34:22.623
My mom is the only one in this world
who truly sees me for who I am.

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:33.384
You must feel so refreshed.

00:34:34.802 --> 00:34:36.596
What? Mr. Gong?

00:34:42.059 --> 00:34:42.977
Ms. Go Da-rim?

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.312
What are you doing here?

00:34:45.479 --> 00:34:48.691
Is he your team leader?

00:34:48.774 --> 00:34:49.775
Yeah.

00:34:51.944 --> 00:34:53.696
Hello.

00:34:54.322 --> 00:34:56.741
I'm Go Da-rim's mother.

00:34:57.366 --> 00:34:59.952
-Wait, let me…
-Mom, you can't stand up.

00:35:00.036 --> 00:35:02.580
He's your boss.
I have to greet him properly.

00:35:02.663 --> 00:35:04.165
-No, please sit.
-Mom.

00:35:04.248 --> 00:35:05.917
No, wait.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.127
The floor must be cold.

00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:09.629
Is that better?

00:35:10.755 --> 00:35:12.256
Don't strain yourself.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.134
Thank you, sir.

00:35:15.218 --> 00:35:18.387
Thank you for hiring my Da-rim.

00:35:18.971 --> 00:35:21.891
Things were rough for her for a long time.

00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:24.894
But now that she's working,
her eyes are sparkling and full of life.

00:35:27.897 --> 00:35:32.985
I believe it's all thanks to working
with a great man like you.

00:35:33.945 --> 00:35:38.157
Please continue to take good care
of my Da-rim.

00:35:38.241 --> 00:35:39.075
Sure thing.

00:35:39.867 --> 00:35:42.745
Please be kind to her.

00:35:53.798 --> 00:35:56.509
Is your mother very unwell?

00:35:58.594 --> 00:36:00.513
The men who chased me yesterday…

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.100
are loan sharks.

00:36:04.976 --> 00:36:07.895
The truth is, my younger sister
borrowed money from everywhere

00:36:09.021 --> 00:36:10.564
before going into hiding.

00:36:11.399 --> 00:36:13.526
The shock led my mother to collapse,

00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:17.238
and she even ended up
having heart surgery.

00:36:18.489 --> 00:36:19.573
I see.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.534
And now?

00:36:21.617 --> 00:36:23.577
She's a lot better.

00:36:24.537 --> 00:36:25.496
That's good to hear.

00:36:29.208 --> 00:36:31.752
I was so scared
when I first found out what happened.

00:36:33.254 --> 00:36:36.382
I felt nauseous

00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:38.009
and dizzy.

00:36:39.385 --> 00:36:41.345
I don't even know how to describe it.

00:36:43.931 --> 00:36:44.849
Like the ground…

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:48.728
was crumbling beneath you?

00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:50.146
That's it.

00:36:51.022 --> 00:36:53.441
It felt like the ground
beneath my feet crumbled away,

00:36:54.567 --> 00:36:57.028
and I was free-falling
with no end in sight.

00:37:02.658 --> 00:37:04.035
I was such a fool.

00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:07.747
My mom is only human.

00:37:09.874 --> 00:37:13.878
How did I never once think
that she could collapse?

00:37:17.006 --> 00:37:18.090
Because she's your mom.

00:37:19.884 --> 00:37:21.385
Because she was always there for you,

00:37:23.888 --> 00:37:25.431
keeping you safe.

00:37:31.812 --> 00:37:35.649
Every time the hospital staff calls out
"Ms. Jeong Myeong-sun's guardian,"

00:37:35.733 --> 00:37:37.610
I have this awakening

00:37:38.694 --> 00:37:40.571
and realize that I'm my mom's guardian.

00:37:41.238 --> 00:37:42.782
Now,

00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:46.202
it's my turn to protect her.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.080
It was only then that I realized

00:37:49.997 --> 00:37:51.332
how heavy a burden my mom

00:37:52.124 --> 00:37:56.462
had been carrying as my guardian
for all these years.

00:37:58.255 --> 00:37:59.215
And how…

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.302
peacefully and comfortably
I had been living

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.680
in a sanctuary under her protection.

00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:20.903
Speaking of which, Mr. Gong,

00:38:22.113 --> 00:38:23.280
could you please

00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:25.658
give me and our team members

00:38:27.201 --> 00:38:29.912
another chance?

00:38:31.455 --> 00:38:34.375
As mothers and guardians,

00:38:35.084 --> 00:38:37.420
they all live
with desperate determination.

00:38:39.463 --> 00:38:41.924
Please give them the chance
to give it their all without any regret.

00:38:43.175 --> 00:38:44.593
Can you just help us out…

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.721
for six months?

00:38:48.931 --> 00:38:50.766
Please.

00:38:52.768 --> 00:38:53.853
I'm trying to live.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.232
These are not just pieces of paper.

00:38:58.899 --> 00:39:01.402
These are our livelihoods and lifelines.

00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:03.320
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:39:03.404 --> 00:39:05.364
I say, "Mother." You say, "TF." Okay?

00:39:05.448 --> 00:39:06.323
-Yes!
-Okay.

00:39:06.407 --> 00:39:07.241
Mother.

00:39:07.324 --> 00:39:08.242
-TF!
-TF!

00:39:08.325 --> 00:39:10.077
Everyone loved it.

00:39:10.578 --> 00:39:11.871
Really?

00:39:18.419 --> 00:39:20.588
As if you all would stop
just because I say so.

00:39:21.505 --> 00:39:24.383
Everyone's so stubborn
with such strong personalities.

00:39:26.135 --> 00:39:27.386
All right, fine.

00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:29.638
Knock yourselves out.

00:39:29.722 --> 00:39:30.806
Really?

00:39:31.515 --> 00:39:32.391
Do you mean it?

00:39:32.475 --> 00:39:35.227
You can't bring up our kiss again

00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:37.354
and threaten to fire me and all, okay?

00:39:37.438 --> 00:39:38.731
Lower your voice!

00:39:38.814 --> 00:39:40.483
That's nothing to brag about.

00:39:40.566 --> 00:39:42.693
I mean, you just keep bringing it up.

00:39:48.407 --> 00:39:49.783
I'm going to forget about it,

00:39:50.868 --> 00:39:52.203
so don't ever mention it again.

00:39:53.871 --> 00:39:54.914
It was nothing.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.170
Right.

00:40:01.754 --> 00:40:03.797
It was nothing.

00:40:16.644 --> 00:40:18.312
Forget about it?

00:40:20.147 --> 00:40:21.815
What a relief.

00:40:24.443 --> 00:40:25.486
Such a relief.

00:40:39.667 --> 00:40:41.669
I'm on my way now.

00:40:41.752 --> 00:40:43.003
Okay.

00:40:43.087 --> 00:40:44.672
All right.

00:40:47.925 --> 00:40:49.510
Do you have a minute?

00:40:50.177 --> 00:40:52.263
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

00:40:52.346 --> 00:40:53.305
Not right now.

00:40:53.389 --> 00:40:54.473
Right.

00:40:54.557 --> 00:40:56.016
I need to go pick up my son.

00:40:59.019 --> 00:41:00.813
You have a child?

00:41:00.896 --> 00:41:01.855
Why?

00:41:01.939 --> 00:41:04.275
What do you mean why?
He was born. That's why.

00:41:04.984 --> 00:41:06.610
So you're married.

00:41:09.196 --> 00:41:10.364
-Hello.
-Oh.

00:41:10.447 --> 00:41:12.366
We have a reservation under Kim So-yeong.

00:41:18.539 --> 00:41:21.125
Hello, this is Jun's dad.

00:41:21.208 --> 00:41:24.420
I was wondering if it'd be possible
for Jun to stay for the nighttime care.

00:41:28.048 --> 00:41:30.050
There's no one
who can pick him up right now.

00:41:31.802 --> 00:41:33.053
I can go.

00:41:33.929 --> 00:41:35.389
I'll pick him up.

00:41:35.973 --> 00:41:37.975
Just a moment.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.603
Will you really?

00:41:40.686 --> 00:41:41.645
Yes.

00:41:43.647 --> 00:41:45.316
Hello?

00:41:45.399 --> 00:41:47.901
I'm going to have an acquaintance
pick him up.

00:41:47.985 --> 00:41:50.154
Okay, thank you. Bye.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.490
My mom made these cookies.

00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:55.242
-Really?
-Awesome.

00:41:55.326 --> 00:41:57.703
What do you think? Don't they look tasty?

00:41:57.786 --> 00:41:59.288
Yeah. She's the best.

00:41:59.371 --> 00:42:02.166
My mom's really good at cooking too.

00:42:02.249 --> 00:42:04.877
My mom cooks well and is really pretty.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.962
No, my mom's prettier.

00:42:07.046 --> 00:42:08.464
-You're wrong.
-My mom's prettier.

00:42:08.547 --> 00:42:09.923
No, my mom's prettier.

00:42:10.007 --> 00:42:11.842
-No, you're wrong!
-Who's Jun?

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.186
-She's so pretty.
-She is.

00:42:30.235 --> 00:42:32.154
Wow, she's so pretty.

00:42:33.447 --> 00:42:34.448
Me.

00:42:35.366 --> 00:42:36.533
Okay.

00:42:37.451 --> 00:42:38.577
Let's go.

00:42:39.536 --> 00:42:40.496
Who are you?

00:42:41.872 --> 00:42:42.790
Your dad's friend.

00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:46.377
She said she's friends with his dad.

00:42:47.544 --> 00:42:49.088
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Kim Seon-u.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.090
Let's go.

00:42:51.173 --> 00:42:52.091
Bye, Jun.

00:42:52.174 --> 00:42:55.928
-Jun, you're so cool!
-I'm so jealous!

00:42:56.011 --> 00:42:58.389
-I'm so jealous of him.
-He's so lucky.

00:43:05.688 --> 00:43:08.315
-You think I'm pretty too, right?
-Yes.

00:43:10.693 --> 00:43:13.696
I guess you can't fool
the pure, innocent eyes of a child.

00:43:14.947 --> 00:43:16.323
You're pretty handsome too.

00:43:16.407 --> 00:43:18.784
Do you take after your mom or dad?

00:43:20.077 --> 00:43:21.495
Probably my dad.

00:43:21.578 --> 00:43:22.996
Why probably?

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.457
I don't know what my mom looks like.

00:43:25.541 --> 00:43:26.959
I've never met her.

00:43:29.294 --> 00:43:30.379
Really?

00:43:32.214 --> 00:43:35.592
Are you just my dad's friend
or his girlfriend?

00:43:36.218 --> 00:43:37.386
Just a friend.

00:43:38.178 --> 00:43:39.096
I see.

00:43:39.847 --> 00:43:40.723
Why?

00:43:40.806 --> 00:43:42.641
Do you want me to be
your dad's girlfriend?

00:43:43.475 --> 00:43:44.601
Yes.

00:43:47.104 --> 00:43:48.021
Let's go.

00:43:52.025 --> 00:43:54.361
How did the TF team produce such a report?

00:43:54.445 --> 00:43:55.863
Oh, that?

00:43:55.946 --> 00:43:56.989
I reviewed it as well,

00:43:57.072 --> 00:43:59.908
and it was very informative
and well-organized.

00:43:59.992 --> 00:44:02.161
It had excellent readability.

00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:03.746
Exactly.

00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:07.416
I'm asking how a bunch of
loser stay-at-home moms pulled this off.

00:44:07.499 --> 00:44:09.960
The loser stay-at-home moms

00:44:10.043 --> 00:44:11.170
couldn't have written that.

00:44:11.253 --> 00:44:15.507
I bet it was written
by Mr. Gong or Mr. Kang.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.634
This won't do.

00:44:18.635 --> 00:44:20.721
We'll have to put them in the spotlight.

00:44:21.346 --> 00:44:22.765
A live commerce?

00:44:23.432 --> 00:44:24.683
Today?

00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:26.894
Yes, it's an emergency.

00:44:26.977 --> 00:44:29.938
Our competitor is about to livestream
a huge flash sale on diapers.

00:44:30.022 --> 00:44:32.691
If we don't actively counter it
with one of our own,

00:44:32.775 --> 00:44:34.276
we'll suffer a major blow.

00:44:34.359 --> 00:44:37.154
But out of all days,
the entire broadcast team

00:44:37.237 --> 00:44:38.739
just had to be on a business trip.

00:44:38.822 --> 00:44:40.574
This sounds like it's outside our purview.

00:44:42.951 --> 00:44:44.536
No one here has experience with that.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.330
What are you talking about?

00:44:46.413 --> 00:44:48.832
We've changed hundreds,
thousands of diapers.

00:44:49.833 --> 00:44:51.001
It's a piece of cake.

00:44:51.084 --> 00:44:53.837
You've changed diapers,
but you've never done a broadcast before.

00:44:53.921 --> 00:44:56.882
That might actually be better.

00:44:56.965 --> 00:45:02.221
They may lack experience in hosting,
but we could work the real mom angle.

00:45:02.304 --> 00:45:03.722
Appeal to consumers with authenticity!

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.144
That's the kind of strategy
that works in today's market!

00:45:09.937 --> 00:45:13.398
I was a member
of the broadcasting club in high school.

00:45:13.482 --> 00:45:17.236
My friends used to rave about my voice.

00:45:17.319 --> 00:45:20.322
If the sales are strong, it could help
our performance reviews later too.

00:45:20.405 --> 00:45:21.907
It sounds like a good opportunity.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.700
I mean, that's true, but…

00:45:23.784 --> 00:45:24.868
Forget it.

00:45:26.787 --> 00:45:28.205
Look for another team.

00:45:28.705 --> 00:45:30.123
What if something goes wrong
during the live?

00:45:30.832 --> 00:45:33.752
Mr. Gong,
can't you trust us just this once?

00:45:34.336 --> 00:45:36.797
-We're confident we can do it.
-Yeah!

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.632
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:45:45.055 --> 00:45:47.307
All right, then.

00:45:47.391 --> 00:45:51.562
-I'll take that as a yes.
-Yes.

00:45:51.645 --> 00:45:52.854
Make sure you prepare well.

00:45:52.938 --> 00:45:54.982
-I can't believe it.
-I know we can do this.

00:45:55.065 --> 00:45:56.650
-We need to start prepping now.
-Right.

00:45:56.733 --> 00:45:59.069
-We need to come up with a plan.
-Right.

00:45:59.152 --> 00:46:00.070
-Of course.
-Right.

00:46:00.153 --> 00:46:01.405
I'll write the script.

00:46:01.488 --> 00:46:02.823
-That's great.
-Sounds good.

00:46:10.622 --> 00:46:12.791
Ms. Bae and Ms. Jang will be our hosts.

00:46:12.874 --> 00:46:13.792
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:46:13.875 --> 00:46:16.587
-Ms. Lee and I will do the prep.
-Okay.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.338
The purchasing of props
and the giveaway prize

00:46:18.422 --> 00:46:19.673
will be done by Ms. Go and…

00:46:21.049 --> 00:46:22.092
Mr. Gong.

00:46:25.053 --> 00:46:26.305
I have to participate?

00:46:26.388 --> 00:46:27.639
Were you planning on freeloading?

00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:30.183
Fine, I'll do it.

00:46:30.976 --> 00:46:32.936
For the giveaway prize,

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.397
how about BeBeZza,
our company's baby formula maker?

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.107
I looked into that as well,

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.109
but the new model sold out
as soon as it launched,

00:46:39.192 --> 00:46:40.861
so even HQ can't secure inventory.

00:46:40.944 --> 00:46:43.905
They said the next restock
will happen next week.

00:46:43.989 --> 00:46:46.408
Why don't we
think of something else for today?

00:46:46.491 --> 00:46:48.076
That's too bad.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.995
We'd sell out with a BeBeZza giveaway.

00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:54.207
Nan-suk and I'll be heading to the salon.

00:46:54.291 --> 00:46:57.502
It'd be rude not to at least
do our hair for a broadcast.

00:46:57.586 --> 00:46:59.713
-We probably should.
-Yes.

00:46:59.796 --> 00:47:02.257
Great. But first, bring it in.

00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:03.175
-Bring it in.
-Come on.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.969
You all remember, right?

00:47:06.053 --> 00:47:08.263
-I say, "Mother." You say, "TF." Okay?
-Okay.

00:47:08.347 --> 00:47:10.098
-Mother.
-TF!

00:47:12.643 --> 00:47:14.645
We got this! Let's go!

00:47:14.728 --> 00:47:15.646
Nan-suk.

00:47:21.318 --> 00:47:23.987
Thank you for giving us a chance,
Mr. Gong.

00:47:24.071 --> 00:47:25.947
A chance. That's it.

00:47:26.573 --> 00:47:27.574
You figure out the rest.

00:47:28.909 --> 00:47:31.203
I'm also just giving you a ride.
That's it.

00:47:32.913 --> 00:47:34.373
Don't even think about
asking me for support.

00:47:34.456 --> 00:47:35.791
I won't. Don't worry.

00:47:51.264 --> 00:47:52.474
These are so cute.

00:47:52.557 --> 00:47:54.851
Don't you think these would be adorable
as props in the background?

00:47:55.435 --> 00:47:56.728
Not really.

00:47:56.812 --> 00:47:58.480
Which one do you think is better?

00:48:02.192 --> 00:48:03.193
That one.

00:48:03.694 --> 00:48:05.904
My gosh, I knew it.

00:48:05.987 --> 00:48:08.782
Your husband has a discerning eye.

00:48:08.865 --> 00:48:11.910
This is our recent bestseller.

00:48:11.993 --> 00:48:13.161
"Husband"?

00:48:13.912 --> 00:48:15.163
Who are you calling her husband?

00:48:15.747 --> 00:48:16.748
Pardon?

00:48:16.832 --> 00:48:19.000
We're just work colleagues.

00:48:19.084 --> 00:48:19.918
Team leader.

00:48:20.001 --> 00:48:21.086
Team member.

00:48:22.754 --> 00:48:24.423
I told you I didn't want to shop.

00:48:25.716 --> 00:48:26.967
-I'm sorry.
-No worries.

00:48:36.893 --> 00:48:39.187
-Let's go if you have everything.
-Not yet.

00:48:39.271 --> 00:48:41.356
I still have to get the giveaway prize.
That's what matters most.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.233
It needs to be impactful.

00:48:43.316 --> 00:48:44.651
What should we get?

00:48:44.735 --> 00:48:46.027
You'd know better than me

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.989
what moms would like.

00:48:49.072 --> 00:48:50.782
Now, for the winning couple
of today's game…

00:48:50.866 --> 00:48:52.868
-Right, of course, I do know.
-Ta-da!

00:48:52.951 --> 00:48:54.828
-I do, but…
-This is sold out everywhere.

00:48:54.911 --> 00:48:57.372
It's the newest baby formula maker
from Natural BeBe.

00:48:57.456 --> 00:49:00.459
BeBeZza!

00:49:02.002 --> 00:49:03.003
BeBeZza?

00:49:03.086 --> 00:49:04.671
-Are you excited about this?
-BeBeZza?

00:49:04.755 --> 00:49:05.964
-Make some noise!
-Mr. Gong, it's BeBeZza!

00:49:06.047 --> 00:49:07.507
-It's BeBeZza!
-What are you doing?

00:49:09.718 --> 00:49:12.304
I say, "BeBe." You say, "Zza."

00:49:12.387 --> 00:49:14.222
-BeBeZza!
-Do you see how the moms are going wild?

00:49:14.306 --> 00:49:17.058
We need to win that
and give that away on our livestream.

00:49:17.142 --> 00:49:18.852
-We must.
-Let's just buy something else.

00:49:18.935 --> 00:49:20.187
We have to sign up for the game now.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.480
Wait, hold on.

00:49:21.563 --> 00:49:22.397
You can do it alone.

00:49:22.481 --> 00:49:23.398
Good luck!

00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:25.317
How can I?

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.277
Only married couples can participate.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.570
Just once.

00:49:28.653 --> 00:49:29.738
-BeBeZza!
-BeBeZza!

00:49:29.821 --> 00:49:30.697
Please.

00:49:48.256 --> 00:49:49.883
I'm really about to lose it.

00:49:49.966 --> 00:49:53.261
The first round is called
"Newspaper of Love."

00:49:53.345 --> 00:49:56.598
If even one of the couples
steps on the ground outside the newspaper,

00:49:56.681 --> 00:49:58.725
that couple will be out.

00:49:58.809 --> 00:50:01.728
Couples that survive five seconds
will move on to the next round.

00:50:01.812 --> 00:50:03.271
Get ready!

00:50:03.355 --> 00:50:04.397
PANGPANG, BULLDOZER

00:50:04.481 --> 00:50:05.524
LOVEY, DOVEY

00:50:05.607 --> 00:50:06.608
ENTJ

00:50:07.108 --> 00:50:08.151
SKY, ROCKET

00:50:10.195 --> 00:50:15.575
-Five, four, three, two, one!
-Five, four, three, two, one!

00:50:15.659 --> 00:50:18.036
Let the second round begin!

00:50:21.456 --> 00:50:26.753
-Five, four, three, two, one!
-Five, four, three, two, one!

00:50:26.837 --> 00:50:28.630
Let the third round begin!

00:50:46.481 --> 00:50:48.859
-Five, four, three…
-Five, four, three…

00:50:48.942 --> 00:50:50.443
This is getting intense.

00:50:50.527 --> 00:50:52.404
-Two, one!
-Two, one!

00:50:52.988 --> 00:50:54.906
Pass!

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.949
It's time for the fourth round.

00:50:56.032 --> 00:50:58.243
The difficulty level
is getting much higher.

00:50:58.326 --> 00:50:59.870
Here we go!

00:51:00.662 --> 00:51:02.581
Oh no, my handsome husband.

00:51:02.664 --> 00:51:04.207
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

00:51:04.291 --> 00:51:05.667
Are you okay?

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.878
Yes, I'm okay.

00:51:09.379 --> 00:51:11.298
Wait, hold on. Watch my hair.

00:51:11.923 --> 00:51:13.133
Hang on.

00:51:22.475 --> 00:51:23.685
Damn it, this is brutal.

00:51:36.239 --> 00:51:38.742
Now, the final round
for the last two teams will be

00:51:38.825 --> 00:51:39.910
"From Mouth to Mouth."

00:51:39.993 --> 00:51:42.245
Ready? Start!

00:52:23.578 --> 00:52:24.788
The winning team is…

00:52:24.871 --> 00:52:27.165
Congratulations, Team One!

00:52:51.064 --> 00:52:52.440
Seriously!

00:52:53.108 --> 00:52:54.234
Why did you make me participate?

00:52:54.901 --> 00:52:56.277
I'm sorry.

00:52:56.861 --> 00:52:58.029
Get in.

00:52:58.113 --> 00:52:59.322
It just made us run late.

00:53:00.115 --> 00:53:01.366
Hold on.

00:53:05.203 --> 00:53:06.079
Got it.

00:53:09.791 --> 00:53:11.710
My BeBeZza…

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.378
Hey.

00:53:14.337 --> 00:53:15.964
I need to use the bathroom.

00:53:16.047 --> 00:53:17.090
Okay.

00:53:20.969 --> 00:53:21.845
Excuse me?

00:53:22.679 --> 00:53:24.806
You want to make a trade?

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.474
Yes.

00:53:27.058 --> 00:53:28.435
Babe.

00:53:28.518 --> 00:53:29.352
Why would we?

00:53:29.436 --> 00:53:32.605
We worked our butts off to win this,
and this is worth way more than that.

00:53:32.689 --> 00:53:35.358
-Right, babe?
-Yeah. What a weirdo.

00:53:44.409 --> 00:53:45.243
How much do you want?

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.371
It's a black card.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.085
They just agreed to trade it?

00:53:54.669 --> 00:53:55.503
Yes.

00:53:55.587 --> 00:53:57.964
They said their baby started eating
solid food or something,

00:53:58.506 --> 00:54:00.675
and they just entered the contest for fun.

00:54:00.759 --> 00:54:02.260
Really?

00:54:02.343 --> 00:54:04.637
But they were playing
like their lives depended on it.

00:54:05.889 --> 00:54:08.099
Anyway, they're such nice people.

00:54:08.183 --> 00:54:10.185
I'm sure they could've sold it
for a lot of money.

00:54:10.268 --> 00:54:11.269
How nice of them.

00:54:11.352 --> 00:54:13.104
-It was pretty expensive.
-Sorry?

00:54:14.189 --> 00:54:15.565
-What?
-What?

00:54:16.149 --> 00:54:17.192
Nothing.

00:54:25.408 --> 00:54:27.744
What sort of game did you play
for them to give you that?

00:54:29.245 --> 00:54:30.163
Well…

00:54:31.164 --> 00:54:33.416
You know, just a normal game.

00:54:35.043 --> 00:54:36.669
What about Ms. Bae and Ms. Jang?

00:54:36.753 --> 00:54:39.005
They said they were getting changed.

00:54:39.089 --> 00:54:41.591
Oh, there they…

00:54:44.469 --> 00:54:45.595
Nan-suk!

00:54:46.096 --> 00:54:47.639
What's wrong?

00:54:47.722 --> 00:54:48.932
What? It's nothing.

00:54:49.516 --> 00:54:51.059
Something is clearly going on.

00:54:51.142 --> 00:54:52.811
Your face is a mess.

00:54:52.894 --> 00:54:53.853
I'm fine.

00:54:53.937 --> 00:54:56.356
Should I get ready over there?

00:54:56.439 --> 00:54:57.941
What happened? Tell me.

00:54:58.024 --> 00:54:59.025
No, don't worry about it.

00:54:59.109 --> 00:55:01.569
Did something happen to your child?

00:55:04.739 --> 00:55:05.949
Well, I…

00:55:06.533 --> 00:55:08.785
My youngest has always been weak.

00:55:08.868 --> 00:55:12.330
He's running a fever of 40°C,
and he's at the ER right now.

00:55:12.413 --> 00:55:14.958
I'm just so worried about him.

00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:15.917
Go to him.

00:55:16.751 --> 00:55:19.838
No, Mr. Gong, it's fine.
I need to finish work first.

00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:20.922
It's an order.

00:55:21.965 --> 00:55:23.424
Go.

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.552
Yes, you should.

00:55:25.635 --> 00:55:26.970
Your child is sick.

00:55:27.053 --> 00:55:28.388
What could be more important?

00:55:28.471 --> 00:55:31.099
We'll take care of the broadcast,
so hurry and go.

00:55:33.059 --> 00:55:34.519
Are you sure?

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.397
Okay. Thank you.

00:55:39.774 --> 00:55:40.900
-Thank you.
-Okay.

00:55:41.484 --> 00:55:42.777
Get there safely.

00:55:46.114 --> 00:55:47.157
Then…

00:55:47.907 --> 00:55:49.242
Who will host?

00:55:49.325 --> 00:55:50.493
Ms. Jang has to do it alone.

00:55:50.577 --> 00:55:51.828
Where is she?

00:55:52.912 --> 00:55:55.039
I'm right here.

00:55:58.168 --> 00:55:59.169
Jin-hui.

00:56:00.003 --> 00:56:01.296
What's wrong with you?

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.382
Well, you see…

00:56:05.675 --> 00:56:07.385
Oh my goodness.

00:56:07.468 --> 00:56:10.805
I look like a news anchor.

00:56:10.889 --> 00:56:13.558
This definitely calls for a selfie.

00:56:14.225 --> 00:56:15.310
My goodness.

00:56:18.521 --> 00:56:20.190
Come on, lighting.

00:56:20.273 --> 00:56:22.108
You need to help me out here.

00:56:22.192 --> 00:56:25.278
Don't worry, I can fix you.

00:56:42.879 --> 00:56:45.965
-I can do it while wearing my sun--
-Are you being serious right now?

00:56:47.258 --> 00:56:49.302
You should also go to the hospital. Go.

00:56:50.511 --> 00:56:51.387
Wait, hold on.

00:56:51.471 --> 00:56:52.639
Ji-hyeok.

00:56:53.223 --> 00:56:54.724
-I'm sorry.
-You should go.

00:56:54.807 --> 00:56:56.643
-I think I hurt my back too.
-Oh gosh.

00:56:56.726 --> 00:56:58.770
-What am I going to do?
-You'll be okay.

00:57:00.438 --> 00:57:03.149
Should we just cancel it?

00:57:03.233 --> 00:57:04.108
No, we can't.

00:57:04.192 --> 00:57:05.235
Of course not.

00:57:05.318 --> 00:57:06.486
Then what do we do?

00:57:09.239 --> 00:57:10.698
Five seconds to air!

00:57:11.241 --> 00:57:13.993
Three, two, one.

00:57:16.246 --> 00:57:20.250
STARTING NOW

00:57:21.292 --> 00:57:22.126
What the…

00:57:26.047 --> 00:57:27.257
Say hello.

00:57:32.095 --> 00:57:33.388
Hello.

00:57:33.471 --> 00:57:36.349
I'm Lee Go-eun
from Natural BeBe's Mother TF Team.

00:57:36.933 --> 00:57:39.602
I'm Go Da-rim.

00:57:40.186 --> 00:57:44.983
Today, we'll be holding a mega sale event
for Angel Hug diapers.

00:57:45.066 --> 00:57:46.526
For the giveaway prize,

00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:50.947
we've prepared your favorite, BeBeZza,

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:52.991
so please stay tuned.

00:57:53.074 --> 00:57:54.242
BEBEZZA AS A GIVEAWAY PRIZE?

00:57:54.325 --> 00:57:57.745
First, can you tell us
what features Angel Hug offers?

00:57:58.496 --> 00:58:01.124
Well…

00:58:08.256 --> 00:58:10.800
There's a reason why our Angel Hug

00:58:10.883 --> 00:58:12.885
is the most loved diaper
by moms and babies.

00:58:12.969 --> 00:58:14.429
You know what it is, right?

00:58:14.929 --> 00:58:15.972
That's correct.

00:58:16.639 --> 00:58:19.767
Cozy and comfortable
as a hug from an angel.

00:58:19.851 --> 00:58:22.770
People praise it
for living up to its name.

00:58:22.854 --> 00:58:23.813
And…

00:58:25.398 --> 00:58:28.901
it's all thanks to its ice-cooling system.

00:58:28.985 --> 00:58:31.529
Thirty thousand double air holes

00:58:31.613 --> 00:58:34.115
-quickly absorb the babies' pee and poop…
-Okay.

00:58:34.198 --> 00:58:35.825
Let's take a few questions.

00:58:35.908 --> 00:58:37.118
Questions…

00:58:37.201 --> 00:58:39.037
LET'S ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
"HOW DO WE CHOOSE THE RIGHT SIZE?"

00:58:43.374 --> 00:58:45.251
Wow, look at all those comments.

00:58:45.335 --> 00:58:47.962
We'll now answer a few questions.

00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:51.215
"How do we choose the right size?"

00:58:51.299 --> 00:58:54.385
That's a question from BonnieNewbieMom.

00:58:54.469 --> 00:58:56.638
Yes, our Angel Hug…

00:58:56.721 --> 00:58:59.140
We'll now take one last question.

00:58:59.223 --> 00:59:03.019
"Is there something that sets
Angel Hug apart from other products?"

00:59:03.102 --> 00:59:05.396
Go-eun, what do you think?

00:59:07.148 --> 00:59:08.858
I'm not sure.

00:59:09.442 --> 00:59:10.485
Pardon?

00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:13.237
I've only ever used Angel Hug,

00:59:13.321 --> 00:59:14.989
so I can't make a comparison.

00:59:15.698 --> 00:59:19.786
I believe she's saying that's
how much trust she has in Angel Hug.

00:59:19.869 --> 00:59:22.413
It is the number one diaper brand
in the market, after all.

00:59:22.497 --> 00:59:23.706
No.

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:26.918
I didn't have any other choice
but Angel Hug.

00:59:28.628 --> 00:59:31.756
I gave birth to my daughter
right after I graduated from high school.

00:59:33.216 --> 00:59:36.302
My husband worked as a deliveryman
to earn money for diapers,

00:59:38.221 --> 00:59:40.056
but he passed away in a car accident.

00:59:40.682 --> 00:59:43.309
I had a baby to raise, but no money.

00:59:44.102 --> 00:59:45.853
I was completely lost.

00:59:48.189 --> 00:59:49.857
That's when I received

00:59:49.941 --> 00:59:52.193
a year's supply of Angel Hug diapers,
donated by Natural BeBe.

00:59:53.986 --> 00:59:57.281
I remember crying all night
while holding onto that box.

01:00:00.743 --> 01:00:02.495
As a result,

01:00:02.578 --> 01:00:04.956
I was able to raise my daughter well
without a single diaper rash.

01:00:05.498 --> 01:00:08.209
I think that's all I have to share
at this moment.

01:00:11.629 --> 01:00:13.339
I shouldn't have shared that.

01:00:14.507 --> 01:00:15.717
I'm sorry.

01:00:16.217 --> 01:00:17.593
No, Go-eun.

01:00:17.677 --> 01:00:19.178
Don't apologize for that.

01:00:20.096 --> 01:00:22.515
You should be proud and commended for it.

01:00:24.517 --> 01:00:25.476
Look.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.937
Everyone is cheering you on
in the comments.

01:00:29.272 --> 01:00:32.775
"It must've been so tough for you
at such a young age."

01:00:32.859 --> 01:00:34.736
"You're an amazing mother."

01:00:34.819 --> 01:00:35.903
"Keep going."

01:00:36.696 --> 01:00:39.157
"I'll pray for your baby
to grow up healthy."

01:00:42.076 --> 01:00:43.119
Thank you.

01:00:43.995 --> 01:00:45.163
-Sorry. Excuse me.
-Okay.

01:00:48.332 --> 01:00:49.208
Hey.

01:00:53.129 --> 01:00:54.088
Okay.

01:00:55.673 --> 01:00:56.632
Okay what?

01:00:56.716 --> 01:00:59.802
It seems Go-eun has been moved
by your comments.

01:00:59.886 --> 01:01:02.263
Thank you so much
for your kind words of support.

01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:06.642
While we wait for her…

01:01:08.227 --> 01:01:09.604
DIAPER DEMONSTRATION

01:01:11.063 --> 01:01:14.275
Go-eun was supposed to do
the diaper demonstration.

01:01:14.358 --> 01:01:16.527
If you could just wait for a moment…

01:01:17.236 --> 01:01:18.446
Oh no, what do I do now?

01:01:18.529 --> 01:01:20.490
I've never changed a diaper before.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.661
Okay.

01:01:25.745 --> 01:01:28.498
I'll now proceed
with the diaper demonstration.

01:01:31.918 --> 01:01:33.252
Stay calm.

01:01:33.336 --> 01:01:35.880
I've already memorized the product manual.

01:01:35.963 --> 01:01:39.842
Waste absorbency is the key feature
of this season's Angel Hug.

01:01:39.926 --> 01:01:42.178
Now, should we test it out?

01:01:44.305 --> 01:01:46.557
I'm going to pour this whole thing.

01:01:47.475 --> 01:01:48.392
Here we go.

01:01:49.101 --> 01:01:50.144
My goodness.

01:01:50.645 --> 01:01:52.063
There we go.

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:55.691
Is this right?

01:01:55.775 --> 01:01:56.901
This should be right.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.904
There we go. I did it!

01:01:59.987 --> 01:02:01.113
Take a look.

01:02:01.197 --> 01:02:03.199
No matter how active your baby may be,

01:02:03.282 --> 01:02:05.034
it will never leak…

01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:13.125
THAT'S A BIT SHOCKING
ON-AIR ACCIDENT LOL

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:15.211
WHY IS IT LEAKING?
MAYBE YOU PUT IT ON WRONG?

01:02:15.294 --> 01:02:16.128
Oh no.

01:02:17.296 --> 01:02:19.006
Oh no!

01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:21.926
What do we do?

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.264
Are you satisfied?

01:02:32.562 --> 01:02:34.522
You've got to be kidding me.

01:02:35.064 --> 01:02:37.191
Ms. Go! Are you really a mom?

01:02:37.275 --> 01:02:40.152
Look at the mess you made
because you couldn't change a mere diaper!

01:02:40.236 --> 01:02:41.529
I'm sorry.

01:02:41.612 --> 01:02:44.031
I got nervous in front of the camera.

01:02:44.115 --> 01:02:47.952
Our company's credibility
has hit rock bottom because of you!

01:02:48.035 --> 01:02:50.788
What are you going to do now?
How will you take responsibility?

01:02:51.998 --> 01:02:53.583
That's enough, Mr. Ma.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:54.500
What?

01:03:01.382 --> 01:03:04.093
It was her first broadcast,
so she got nervous and made a mistake.

01:03:04.677 --> 01:03:07.305
Weren't you the one
who forced us to take on this broadcast

01:03:07.388 --> 01:03:09.098
in the first place anyway?

01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:10.224
Also,

01:03:11.684 --> 01:03:13.269
Ms. Go is a member of my team.

01:03:14.645 --> 01:03:16.439
If anyone is going to scold her
and take responsibility for her,

01:03:17.648 --> 01:03:19.775
it'll be me.

01:03:21.444 --> 01:03:25.031
Then are you planning
to write up an incident report as well?

01:03:25.114 --> 01:03:26.616
The director is asking for one.

01:03:26.699 --> 01:03:28.034
All right.

01:03:28.117 --> 01:03:28.993
I'll write it.

01:03:29.076 --> 01:03:30.745
Sure, go ahead then.

01:03:39.462 --> 01:03:41.297
I thought I studied enough,

01:03:41.797 --> 01:03:43.257
but reality is sure different.

01:03:45.134 --> 01:03:46.886
I'll just have to keep practicing.

01:03:49.847 --> 01:03:50.723
Hey, Da-rim.

01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:52.975
You should maintain a work-life balance.

01:03:53.059 --> 01:03:56.103
You shouldn't work this late
and make people wait.

01:03:57.730 --> 01:04:00.191
Let go of me, or I'll report you!

01:04:00.274 --> 01:04:02.610
Damn it. You already did.

01:04:02.693 --> 01:04:04.195
And it put me in a real tight spot.

01:04:04.278 --> 01:04:06.864
-You're coming with us.
-Because it was unlawful debt collection!

01:04:06.948 --> 01:04:08.449
Just obey the law!

01:04:14.872 --> 01:04:15.706
Get her in the car.

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:17.291
Help!

01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:20.252
Jeez, why are you so strong?

01:04:21.295 --> 01:04:23.130
You're the one who scammed us.
Hey, get her in.

01:04:23.214 --> 01:04:25.132
Help! No!

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:28.678
-Help me!
-Hey!

01:04:28.761 --> 01:04:30.763
Lift her legs!

01:04:30.846 --> 01:04:32.974
Lift her legs!

01:04:33.057 --> 01:04:34.892
The men who chased me yesterday

01:04:34.976 --> 01:04:36.769
are loan sharks.

01:04:36.852 --> 01:04:39.897
The truth is, my younger sister
borrowed money from everywhere

01:04:41.023 --> 01:04:42.525
before going into hiding.

01:04:45.736 --> 01:04:46.946
Let's get going.

01:04:48.155 --> 01:04:49.490
Goddamn it!

01:04:50.366 --> 01:04:53.452
Just stay still!

01:04:54.161 --> 01:04:56.998
Why are you so damn strong?

01:04:57.081 --> 01:04:58.124
Hey!

01:04:58.207 --> 01:04:59.250
What are you doing?

01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:00.710
-No!
-Hey!

01:05:00.793 --> 01:05:02.795
Do you want me to
toss you out of a moving car?

01:06:09.487 --> 01:06:10.613
I'll pay you back.

01:06:10.696 --> 01:06:12.239
I can just pay you back.

01:06:12.323 --> 01:06:13.657
One million won per month.

01:06:13.741 --> 01:06:15.743
I'll be able to pay it off in 30 months.

01:06:15.826 --> 01:06:17.244
Come on now.

01:06:17.328 --> 01:06:19.705
-That doesn't add up.
-What do you mean?

01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:21.624
You forgot the interest.

01:06:22.249 --> 01:06:23.584
We're loan sharks.

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:24.543
Let me see that.

01:06:24.627 --> 01:06:25.461
Yes, sir.

01:06:27.254 --> 01:06:31.050
See? 30 months is 270 million won
in interest alone.

01:06:32.343 --> 01:06:33.427
Can you pay that?

01:06:33.511 --> 01:06:35.930
How does 30 million won
become 300 million won?

01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:37.598
That's why

01:06:38.432 --> 01:06:42.061
we should settle this quickly and simply

01:06:42.144 --> 01:06:43.938
before you accrue more interest.

01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:45.940
I honestly don't have anything.

01:06:47.024 --> 01:06:48.901
Don't be silly.

01:06:48.984 --> 01:06:50.820
Think carefully.

01:06:52.488 --> 01:06:55.950
You have a lot to offer in your body.

01:06:58.828 --> 01:07:00.579
Those eyes,

01:07:00.663 --> 01:07:01.956
heart,

01:07:02.039 --> 01:07:03.499
liver, pancreas,

01:07:03.582 --> 01:07:05.251
lungs, bone marrow,

01:07:06.001 --> 01:07:08.212
and more.

01:07:08.295 --> 01:07:09.380
No…

01:07:11.006 --> 01:07:12.633
Which should we sell first?

01:07:56.677 --> 01:07:57.636
Let me buy them off you.

01:07:58.637 --> 01:07:59.638
How much do you want?

01:08:12.151 --> 01:08:13.152
Do you take credit?

01:08:34.882 --> 01:08:39.803
DYNAMITE KISS

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:12.044
Did you tell your husband?
Is he always so indifferent?

01:09:12.127 --> 01:09:14.171
My husband isn't like that.

01:09:14.255 --> 01:09:15.673
You should know what to defend
and what not to.

01:09:15.756 --> 01:09:18.509
Until you pay off this debt,
you're mine, Ms. Go Da-rim.

01:09:18.592 --> 01:09:20.844
You're going to confirm
and sign off on every little thing?

01:09:20.928 --> 01:09:22.054
A competitive pitch?

01:09:22.137 --> 01:09:23.931
-Against the marketing team, at that?
-Good luck.

01:09:24.014 --> 01:09:26.058
You've never raised a kid, have you?

01:09:26.141 --> 01:09:27.893
Oh no. Have I been exposed?

01:09:27.977 --> 01:09:29.687
What? Where are you going to work?

01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:31.981
If everyone knows I'm your husband,
it'll clear up all the doubts.

01:09:32.064 --> 01:09:33.148
If it makes you uncomfortable…

01:09:33.232 --> 01:09:35.359
If anyone is uncomfortable, it'd be you.

01:09:35.442 --> 01:09:37.695
I look forward to working with you.
I'm Kim Seon-u.

01:09:37.778 --> 01:09:42.783
