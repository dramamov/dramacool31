WEBVTT

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.050
What's wrong?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.750
Hey, what's wrong? You can tell me.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.460
Tae Kyung.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.260
It's about Mi So...

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.830
My Mi So...

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.300
What about Mi So?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.540
Come on, just say something.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.060
How can this be?

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.160
(Episode 108)

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.860
So, are you saying
they were really switched at birth?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.900
I don't think he was making it up.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.900
He knew too many details of the incident
20 years ago for that.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.710
I can't believe this.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.410
Tae Kyung.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.910
I'm so scared.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.410
What if...

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.020
they were really switched?

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.290
Even if that's true, nothing changes.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.360
Once Mi So's mom, always Mi So's mom.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.100
You loved her more than your own life,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.200
and the fact that you came all this way
to avenge her wrongful death...

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.540
is proof of that.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.790
What are you doing at home at this hour?

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.460
Where's Se Ri?

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.390
In her room.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.930
She's taking a nap, which she never does.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.820
Are you really my flesh and blood?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.400
Were you really switched with my Mi So
20 years ago?

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.880
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.820
Here.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.790
I reviewed the contract
for our new partner.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.760
It needs some tweaks,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.890
but the terms are okay.
We should be good to sign.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.860
Lawyer Kim, wait a second.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.730
This isn't the right place to talk.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.470
After work today,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.810
let's get a drink.
I have something important to discuss.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.410
Just the two of us?

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640
Wait.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.880
Don't you think you're asking
the wrong guy?

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.980
No. I'm sure I've picked the right person.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.520
I really need to talk to you, Lawyer Kim.
So if you're free,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.290
let's have that drink.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.960
Just the two of us?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.690
Why should I?

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.160
Like I said,
I have something important to say.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.400
Look, just because you have
something important to say...

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.630
doesn't mean I'm obligated
to listen, does it?

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.870
Especially not over drinks with just you.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.370
If it's awkward for you two,
I can tag along.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.470
- No.
- No.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.980
Gosh, you could've just said no.
Did you have to say it in unison?

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.310
Fine, I don't want to go anyway. So petty!

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.420
You two have a nice, cozy time together.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.400
All right, then.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.030
So, what's so important
that I had to hear it tonight?

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.170
Lawyer Kim.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.470
What do you believe defines the bond
between a parent and child?

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.470
Where is this suddenly coming from?

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.980
So you heard everything.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.310
If that's the case,
shouldn't you stay away from her now?

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.750
- What are you talking about?
- Min Doo Sik. That old geezer.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.120
He's useless even if he wakes up,
and that's assuming he even will.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.400
Well, I...

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.900
Lucia... No, Baek Sul Hee and our Se Ri...

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.140
The three of us want to start over.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.400
So I need you to get out of the picture.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.380
You're a truly pathetic man, Kim Sun Jae.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.380
What did you just say?

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.690
Fine. Since you already know who I am,
I'll drop the formalities.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.290
My name, Moon Tae Kyung.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.030
I got it from my adoptive parents
when I was adopted to the US.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.360
My birth parents died in a car accident.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.730
The bond between a parent and child...

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.400
is forged by the love and care
of raising them, not just by blood.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.970
Such a hypocrite.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.310
I'm sick of you
and Baek Sul Hee's righteous act.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.510
If blood means nothing to you,

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.080
then why did you crawl all the way here
to avenge your dead parents?

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.780
And what about Baek Sul Hee?

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.690
Since she found out Mi So was
her own flesh and blood,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.120
isn't that why she threw
her whole life away?

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.720
Even going so far as to marry
that old geezer, Min Doo Sik?

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.390
And you're still telling me
blood doesn't matter?

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.030
I came to Mingang to right a wrong...

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.470
and make sure the guilty are punished.
Lucia is doing the same.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.970
She's here to make the people of Mingang
pay for what they did.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.770
By your logic,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.410
who in the world would ever adopt
or take in someone else's child?

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.780
They're not related by blood,
after all, right?

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.250
But you know, in this world,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.790
there are things that run
deeper than blood.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.920
If you take a child in as your own,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.990
then they are your child.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.330
That's a load of nonsense.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.600
Fine. Do you want to make a bet?

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.870
Now that Baek Sul Hee knows
Se Ri is her daughter,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.470
and if Min Kyung Chae finds out
the late Mi So was her daughter,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.840
what do you think she'll do?

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.840
My bet is she'll give up on her revenge...

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.980
and do whatever it takes...

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.480
- to make Se Ri the heir to Mingang.
- No.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.420
The Sul Hee I know would never do that.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.360
She was so proud to be Mi So's mother.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.960
She would never turn her back
on the years...

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.630
they shared as mother and daughter.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.350
Once Mi So's mom, always Mi So's mom.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.860
My baby...

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.560
- My baby.
- Ma'am? Are you awake?

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.930
Where's my baby?

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.740
My baby...

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.010
I asked you, where is my baby?

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.880
She's in the NICU right now.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.110
She's in an incubator.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.850
Why? What's wrong with her?

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.450
What's wrong? Is she sick?

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.750
She had stopped breathing
when she was brought in,

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.860
so we started intensive care immediately.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.400
Please calm down. You can't move.
You need to rest.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.670
Let go of me! I need to see my baby.
I said, let go!

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.740
You can see her later.
You need to recover first, ma'am.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.540
What's the point of me recovering
if my child is sick?

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.480
What good am I
if my baby is fighting for her life?

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.310
I can't live if something happens to her.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.320
Let me see my baby now.
Please let me see her!

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.650
I need to see for myself how she's doing.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.220
- Let me see her now! Right now!
- Ma'am, please calm down, okay?

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.230
Tonight will be the critical period.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.600
I hope she can just make it
through the night.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.310
My daughter...

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.640
will pull through.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.280
Sweetheart.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.080
Mommy will never give up on you.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.450
No matter what,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.190
I'll never give up on my little girl.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.390
So...

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.630
just hang in there a little longer.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.400
You smiled!

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.410
My little girl,
you just smiled, didn't you?

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.220
Mommy's going to stay
right here with you all night,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.850
so just hang in there.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.920
Okay?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.350
I told you to go home.
Have you been here all night?

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.120
How's my baby?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.960
She's out of the woods.
She should be able to go home soon.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.240
Thank you.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.480
Thank you, my sweet baby.
Thank you so much for holding on.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.190
You're smiling again.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.220
Are you smiling for Mommy?

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.400
My sweet daughter.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.870
I think I'll call you Mi So.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.100
Because you always smile when you see me.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.310
Mi So.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.810
My baby girl.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.020
Baek Mi So.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.020
I love you.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.130
Mommy loves you so much.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.750
Even if you really were my daughter,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.120
even if you and Mi So were switched
at birth 20 years ago,

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.060
that accident four years ago
was still your fault.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.830
My Mi So died a needless death
because of you,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.830
and nothing will ever change that.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.040
Until you, Se Ri, truly repent
and beg for forgiveness,

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.610
I can never accept you as my daughter.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.230
Are you planning on taking Se Ri
to the US?

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.700
Does that make sense
for my granddaughter...

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.400
to live like that
as a high school graduate?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.970
I need to start training her
to be my successor now...

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.970
so she can properly run Mingang Group
in the future.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.780
Right. Tae Joo, what happened
when you went to the hospital?

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.510
How is Min Doo Sik doing?

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.520
He's still just lying there,
unable to communicate or move.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.420
As he should be.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.630
That way, we can make it look
like a suicide if our plan requires it.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.530
- Make it look like a suicide?
- If that old man keeps doting on Lucia...

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.500
and gets in the way of Se Ri's future,
then we must. Do we have a choice?

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.180
Even if you regain movement
in your upper body,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.650
it'll take some time for your lower body.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.420
I looked it up.
That's the case for most patients.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.560
You recognize me, don't you?

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.890
Did Madam Jang send you?
To see if I'm dead or alive?

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.830
She already came to check on me.
Why send someone again to spy on me?

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.200
That darn woman!

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.840
Why are you here?

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.570
So you can talk now.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.140
That's good.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.250
Chairman Min.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.520
Now, listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.820
This has nothing to do with
what Madam Jang wants.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.220
I'm doing this for Lucia.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.020
For Lucia?

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.860
What are you thinking so hard about?

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.630
It's nothing.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.110
So you've decided not to get
a DNA test with Se Ri?

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.080
I think you made the right choice.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.480
Whatever the results are,
you'll always be Mi So's mother.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.350
You're right.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.120
I'll always be Mi So's mom,

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.350
and that's why I will see this through
for her sake.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.530
If someone does something wrong
and gets away with it,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.990
they're bound to do
something even worse next time.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.860
About Se Ri...

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.530
It breaks my heart,

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.540
but she has to be punished
for what she did.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.770
I knew you'd say that.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.540
That's the woman I know.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.210
And to think Kim Sun Jae
doesn't even realize...

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.450
- What about Kim Sun Jae?
- It's nothing.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720
Don't worry about it.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.120
Anyway, now that Kim Sun Jae
knows everything,

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.120
things are going to get
even harder for you.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:55.930
I'm prepared for that.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.700
Have you heard from Tae Joo since then?

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.400
Not yet.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.900
He must be really conflicted.
I'm sure he wants to help us,

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.070
but it's not as easy as it sounds.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.080
Mom! Dad!

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.150
- Speak of the devil.
- Welcome, sweetie!

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.250
Were you just talking about me?

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.090
Parents always talk about their kids.
It's good to see you.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.120
Perfect timing.
I was just about to ask you something.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.490
When is your husband going to
get promoted to be a director?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.760
I think it'll happen soon,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.630
but I think Kyung Chae and that woman
are headed for a showdown first.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.270
What woman? The chairman's young wife?

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.770
She's the acting chairman now,
taking over for my father-in-law.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.810
Kyung Chae lucked out
and got her CEO position back.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.510
There's just no way
the two of them can coexist.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.390
Someone has to be taken
out of the picture for good.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.320
You've got a point.
It wouldn't work for them to share power.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.390
Obviously not.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.830
They're constantly fighting,
vying for the CEO's seat.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.930
And that's not all. At home,

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.670
they're in a huge war of nerves
over Se Ri.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.400
It looks like they'll have to fight it out
to the bitter end.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.370
What are they going to do,
get into a catfight?

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.610
Not literally. It'll come down to
a battle over company shares.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.650
Whoever holds the most shares
in Mingang Distribution...

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.750
will decide the winner.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.390
That's why my husband might need
Dad's shares in an emergency,

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.720
so I told you to hold on to them.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:33.960
You still have them, right?

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.390
What?

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.930
Of course. I've got a death grip on them.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.170
What kind of man would I be
if I sold them?

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.770
I'd be no better than an animal.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.770
Why does your bark sound so pathetic?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.510
Hey.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.510
Did you know Dad and that Lucia woman
got a divorce?

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.420
- They did what?
- They've already finalized the divorce.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.190
Are you sure Dad signed
the papers himself?

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.960
How would I know? No one even knows
where he is right now.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.860
Kyung Chae said he's fine,
so we're just taking her word for it.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.230
But let's be real, how fine can a man
in a coma really be?

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.900
And they got divorced
in the middle of all this?

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.470
I hear they'll hold a shareholder meeting
to kick her out.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.610
With the divorce,
it's really Min Kyung Chae's world now.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.350
(Mingang Distribution)

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.380
What's this I hear from Ji Seop?
You're holding a shareholders' meeting?

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.850
That's how we'll oust Lucia.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.390
Madam Jang is pushing me
to get it done quickly.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.020
The old fox is getting antsy.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.990
That woman thinks my daughter, Se Ri,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.800
is her son's flesh and blood,
so I can just let her be for now.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.340
The problem is,
she'll try to get rid of me first.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.940
And Min Kyung Chae is just a puppet
dancing to the old fox's tune.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.310
What are you thinking so hard about?

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.550
(Mingang Distribution)

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.650
It's nothing.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.990
Before you all get rid of me,
I'll strike first. Just you wait.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.720
My daughter Se Ri will become
the new owner of Mingang.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.100
And my bloodline will rule this company
for generations to come.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.740
If they call a shareholders' meeting,
you'll be dismissed immediately.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.640
Madam Jang will be pulling the strings
from behind the scenes.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440
What do we do now?

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.110
I can't let it end like this.
Not after coming this far.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.620
Could you please give us a moment?
We have something to discuss in private.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.390
If you have something to say, say it here.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.330
It's something you might not want to hear.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.100
It's fine, you can stay.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.600
If you can't say it around Tae Kyung,

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.140
then don't say it to me at all.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.940
No, really, could you please leave?

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.010
This isn't just about me.
It's about me and her.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.410
And by extension, our daughter, Se Ri.
This is a family matter.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.050
Are you crazy?
How dare you call us a family?

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.850
In what world are you and I family?

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:20.390
As long as Se Ri is here, we're a family.
Her mother and father are both right here.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.230
How can we just pretend to be strangers?

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.930
- You're out of your mind.
- That's enough, Mr. Kim.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.200
Address the acting chairman respectfully
if it's business.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.600
If this is personal,

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.800
then take it outside the office.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.270
- This is your cue to leave.
- No.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.810
Not when it involves her.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.180
I know just as much about Jung Lucia...
Or rather,

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.250
the woman named Baek Sul Hee, as you do.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.020
So you're going to be brazen about it?

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.690
And how well do you think you know her?
Listen, Mr. Moon.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.330
I was her first man.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.930
And I'm the father of her child.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.330
Do you have any idea what that means?
You can run your mouth all you want,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.300
but we were sleeping together
and had a child long ago. Understand?

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.310
So keep your nose out of our business
and get lost!

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.820
Goodness. Finally.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.390
What is wrong with you?

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.790
They'll oust you
at the shareholders' meeting.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.830
Min Kyung Chae and Madam Jang.
But I'm going to stop them.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.070
You need to hold onto your position,
so we can stick it to those women.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.810
I'm so touched, I could just cry.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.470
You're not alone in this anymore.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.980
Why else do you think the three of us
were all brought together here?

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.950
This is destiny.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.950
It's destiny telling the three of us
to team up and take over Mingang.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.990
If Mi So heard you say that,
she'd be devastated.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.360
There you go again,
harping on about Mi So.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.830
How long are you going to keep this up?

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.390
Mi So is Min Kyung Chae's daughter.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.070
It's for the best she left when she did.
Imagine if she'd grown up with you.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.240
She would've just bled you dry.
That girl was brazen and greedy.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.980
Say one more word...

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.980
about Mi So like that,

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.750
and I swear you'll regret it.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.490
Hey.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.190
Snap out of it.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.760
Mi So is not your daughter.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.200
What would someone like you know?

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.670
Do you know the bond of raising a child?
The memories we made together?

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.770
For 16 years,

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.740
from breastfeeding her as a baby
to changing her diapers,

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.070
not for a single moment...

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.240
has Mi So...

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.780
ever been anything but my daughter.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.920
And that's never going to change.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.850
That's ridiculous.
Since when were you two a family?

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.050
The way he goes on about "family."

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:39.820
But why did you leave?

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.630
How could you actually leave
just because he told you to?

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.000
Who else do you think
I'm relying on right now?

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:50.000
I just thought you two might have
some unfinished business.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.400
You think there's anything left
between us?

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.740
Have you forgotten
what Kim Sun Jae did to me?

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.610
I'm sorry. You're right, I was wrong.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:04.350
I should have stayed by your side
no matter what.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.190
From now on, don't leave my side,
no matter what anyone says.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.850
Got it?

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.970
Unbelievable. Those two...

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.540
They're always all over each other.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:29.910
Darn it.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.450
Mom!

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.890
I'm so glad I waited
to have dinner with you.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.660
Food tastes better when we eat together.
And we like all the same things.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.130
You're right.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.030
But I don't have an appetite.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.000
You go ahead and eat, Se Ri.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.870
Why not? Is your stomach upset?

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.110
No, it's not that.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.370
You don't have a fever.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.540
Maybe you have indigestion from lunch?

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.590
Then let's eat together.
If you won't eat, I won't eat either.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.820
Se Ri.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.460
Just as you are my daughter,
Mi So is my daughter too.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.570
That's why it's so hard for me
to look at you right now.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.340
Since you seem to be misunderstanding
how I feel,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.710
meet me on the rooftop
when you get to work tomorrow.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.420
I'll show you how I really feel.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.830
What are you even talking about,
your feelings?

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.520
What do you think you're doing?

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.390
This is how I feel.

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.850
I'm not marrying Min Kyung Chae.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.230
After all that time you spent
as Mingang's lapdog for that marriage,

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.360
why are you suddenly acting
so out of character?

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.670
My own flesh and blood is already
part of the owner's family.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:13.640
Now I'm a father, I can't be a lapdog.
Sun Jae, Sul Hee, and Se Ri...

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.040
are going to be the owners of this place.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.510
I'm starting over with you.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:57.780
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.280
(Newborn filming was done
with parents present...)

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.520
(with sufficient rest and safety.)

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.030
You think she and my daughter
will become your family?

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.000
However tough you act, it won't be you.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.740
She's my woman, and that's my daughter.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.640
I see there's no engagement ring either.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.310
You took care of it well, didn't you?

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.080
- Of course.
- Hope you're not chairman for long.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.280
What's that supposed to mean?

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.250
Deciding whether it's better to
get rid of me or let me live?

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.950
So you'll make your move now?

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.520
In that case,
I can't just sit back and take this.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.990
