Chu Moshang...

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.239
How dare you harm someone I protect?

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.518
You've really got some nerve.

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.478
This is a matter
between our two families.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:53.839
You have no right to interfere.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.279
Zong!

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.839
Aren't you going
to take your woman back?

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.798
How are you?

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:10.920
Are you alright?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.519
I'm fine.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.320
I must protect my sigil.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.999
Stop using your energy.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.519
Leave this to me.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.519
As long as we fight side by side,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.399
we can unleash limitless potential.

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.480
Why are you still stunned?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.119
Since young,
you've achieved nothing at all.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.918
You can't even protect your own woman.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.640
You're just a loser!

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.119
Having a son like you

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.320
is simply my shame!

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:41.999
Useless thing.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.040
Loser!

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.160
Loser!

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.399
I'm not a loser.

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.519
I'm not a loser.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.399
Give me back my woman!

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.160
Zong!

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.358

Zong.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.719
Zong.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.760
Father.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.320
Father.

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.638
Someone!

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.919
Prepare the carriage!

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.519
Zong.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:27.359
Zong.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:30.200
(I didn't expect the power
to be this strong.)

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.598
Quick!

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.120
Faster!

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.158
Father.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.119
Zong.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.719
I'm cold.

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.800
Zong,

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.240
do you feel warmer now?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.120
Zong?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.038
Zong!

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.440
Don't fall asleep, Zong.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.278
Wake up!

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.838
Zong!

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.080
Father...

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.719
I...

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.800
I've disappointed you again.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.479
Zong!

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.519
I'll kill the entire Feng family!

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.240
Thank you for helping us so many times.

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.039
Since both of you
have already expressed your feelings,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.039
after the wedding at Feng Manor,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.440
take her away.

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:32.039
My wish has been fulfilled.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.399
No!

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:34.919
Wait...

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.200
You chose him.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:38.999
Why not?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.919
Who said we're getting married?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.719
You...

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.559
You guys are already so close.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.800
It's unreasonable

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:46.599
to not get married.

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:47.638
Zhilou,

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.718
leave it to us.

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.200
How can a marriage

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.279
be one-sided?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.599
You all don't need to worry about it.

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:02.839
Why are you still sitting here?

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.000
Let's go.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.680
Qingfeng,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.439
this time, we've truly offended

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.240
the Lenghou family.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.398
What's been destroyed

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:21.879
is not just

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.680
the alliance between the two families.

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.440
What should we do next?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.839
Proceed with the wedding as planned.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.599
I...

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:48.839
I...

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:50.320
Uh...

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.599
Just pretend it never happened.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.880
I know you're unwilling.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.399
I can't force you.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.239
Look, Young Master

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.640
is starting to act more human now.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.959
And you're starting
to act nonchalant now.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.999
Miss Zhilou, the drinks will be completely
free of charge.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.559
Consider it free advertising
for our shop..

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.598
Miss Zhilou!

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:22.759
Miss Zhilou,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.679
congratulations!

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.919
Congratulations, Miss Zhilou.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.638
You're going to be a bride soon.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.038
You must wear clothes
that match your status.

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:30.038
- Miss Zhilou...
- No...

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:31.119
Let's shop for some clothes.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.759
- Miss Zhilou, come to my house...
- Miss Zhilou!

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.718
The clothes first.

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:34.638
Miss Zhilou...

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.080
Shop for some clothes!

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:37.598
Hold on.

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:38.959
Actually, you guys...

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.598
Miss Zhilou!

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:42.359
Wait, Miss Zhilou!

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.838
Over here, Miss Zhilou. Come.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.439
Wait, no. No need, really.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.640
Someone!

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:48.638
Bring over the newly made

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.119
phoenix wedding robe.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.078
Quickly.

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:52.759
Let Miss Zhilou have a look at it.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.598
Miss Zhilou,

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:55.838
this is made overnight
by the most skilled

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:57.679
embroiderer in our shop.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.559
Look.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.479
Brilliant crimson. Gold threads embroidered
with hidden python patterns.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.999
Lovebirds and pomegranate designs.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.879
A peacock-embroidered misty shawl.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.640
This is the finest material.

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.320
I...

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.799
I don't think it suits me very well.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.439
It suits you.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.719
Boss!

00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:17.479
Boss,

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:19.279
I'm here to collect my wedding dress.

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:23.680
Why is my wedding dress with her?

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:28.760
Miss Yunqiao,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.039
this was prepared for Miss Zhilou.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.080
If you like it, just take it.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.999
This material is great.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.278
Miss Zhilou, please be understanding.

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.558
My groom will definitely like it!

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:47.678
Miss Yunqiao

00:08:47.679 --> 00:08:48.959
seems a little unstable lately.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.680
She's acting somewhat insane.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.920
This one...

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:57.920
No.

00:08:58.439 --> 00:08:59.119
This one won't do.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.599
This color won't do.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.959
This one's good!

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.160
Hey, Feng Yunqiao!

00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:07.038
This one's good!

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:08.239
Miss Yunqiao!

00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:10.239
- Miss Yunqiao.
- I finally found you.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.680
- Why are you here?
- Feng Yunqiao.

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:15.798
Who are you?

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:16.879
Are you crazy or something?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.518
Miss Yunqiao, let's go home.

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.959
Go home, okay?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.879
I'm not going home!

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.440
- Go home, okay?
- I'm not going home!

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.520
- Miss Yunqiao?
- Catch me!

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.239
Catch me!

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.999
Miss Yunqiao!

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.440
Come catch me!

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.239
Young Master!

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.359
I'll go find Feng Zhilou.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.320
Wait.

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:42.680
You don't look well!

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.719
I'll be fine after a bit of rest.

00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:57.560
Quickly go.

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:08.240
I really don't understand
what Young Master is thinking.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.200
It'd be best
to get Feng Zhilou cure him.

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.599
Why must we obey

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.599
the wishes of mere mortals
and even stand up for her?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.680
Truly ridiculous.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.038
Miss Zhilou's life is her own.

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:18.518
Whether she wants to cure Young Master

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:20.038
is naturally her own decision as well.

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:22.079
But if Young Master dies
from the Yang poison,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.359
we will reclaim the sigil,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.719
and she won't live long either.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.839
Fei Yuan...

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.038
Young Master has defended you
in every way.

00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:35.920
What will it take for you
to cure his poison?

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.879
Are the minions of the Dragons
always this overbearing?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.359
If I don't cure your Young Master,
are you going to kill me?

00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:42.239
Fine.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:42.678
Go ahead

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:44.119
and kill me right now.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.638
Anyway, I'm just a loser
who only knows a bit of medicine.

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:47.479
If I die,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.719
your Young Master will suffer

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.719
an explosive death too.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.080
That way, I won't lose anything at all.
Kill me!

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.359
I've never met

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.079
a woman as unreasonable as you!

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.479
You're about to kill me.
I don't have to be reasonable!

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.239
Young Master's Yang poison
has never been cured.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.520
Yesterday, for your safety,
he disregarded himself completely.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.640
Now, he's giving up
on his own life just for you!

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.400
- I...
- Fei Yuan.

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:11.119
Young Master,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.558
don't forget your mission.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:13.400
Young Master,

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:15.479
Miss Zhilou is your last chance.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.199
How did it become this serious?

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.520
You still have the nerve to ask?

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:20.318
Young Master broke

00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:21.918
into Nie Rongzhi's barrier
to look for you.

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:22.839
For the sake of you,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.460
his energy must have been damaged.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.680
After dragging it on this long,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.999
his body has already
been suffering severe pain.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.119
It's getting weaker and weaker.

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:34.798
Why won't you, a mere mortal,

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:36.199
save Young Master?

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.278
Do you know who he is?

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:37.759
Shut up,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.639
Fei Yuan.

00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:41.359
Don't forget,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.678
you're protected by the sigil

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:43.959
because of Young Master.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.199
The sigil was formed
from his most important reverse scale.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.959
Actually,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.759
Young Master's power is protecting you.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.759
That's enough.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.639
Whether I can
cure the Yang poison or not,

00:11:54.319 --> 00:11:56.320
don't make things difficult
for Feng Zhilou.

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:59.239
If anything happens to me,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.359
the sanctuary...

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.639
Enough, Young Master.

00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:04.560
If you won't save him,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.359
we'll find a way ourselves.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.680

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.800
Thank you, Miss Zhilou.

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:17.200
You and the sigil have an agreement.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.638
Now, only you and I

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:20.160
are the masters
of the Canglong Pavilion.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.599
Unless we die.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:24.639
That's why

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.879
you value the sigil so much?

00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:31.080
Now that my Yang poison has been cured,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.160
I must return to the sanctuary anytime.

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:34.520
From now on,

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.639
you can rely on martial cultivation.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.040
My spiritual roots...

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.800
Your nine spiritual roots
have manifested.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.839
They will activate at the right time,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.479
but that depends on you.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.080
For humans,

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:00.839
having spiritual roots
is only the beginning.

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:02.359
Next comes

00:16:02.439 --> 00:16:04.200
persistent martial cultivation.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.959
Only through martial cultivation

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.959
can you discover your true potential

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.280
and unleash it infinitely.

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:15.400
Chu Moshang.

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:18.119
Thank you.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:22.520
Everything that has happened
these past days

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:25.280
feels like a dream.

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:27.959
It's as if the day before,

00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:30.040
I was just a useless person with no

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.839
spiritual roots and martial cultivation
within my family.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.119
I was used,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.119
despised,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.320
and mocked.

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:43.280
But now,

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.520
because I'm going
to marry into the Dragons,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.560
the drinks for the wedding are free,

00:16:48.919 --> 00:16:50.560
and I can get the wedding dress easily.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.239
It's a treatment I've never

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:54.759
had before.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.280
But what they see

00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:00.599
is not me. They only

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:04.080
see the bride of the Dragons.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.239
You don't need to care.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.400
Just be yourself.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.879
I want to become strong.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.599
I want martial cultivation.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.599
I want the world

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.720
to all look up to the name Feng Zhilou.

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.320
I must go to Wujing.
