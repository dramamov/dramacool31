00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.380
Although it's right before my eyes,

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.600
I can't nor do I want to

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.380
believe it until now

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.020
that my wife, Lin Xia

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.460
could do something so cruel.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:05.379
In my eyes,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.439
she was a perfect person.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:08.859
At work,

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:10.500
she's diligent,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.760
and meticulous;

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.099
to others,

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:15.659
gentle and kind;

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.879
to elders,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.420
filial and considerate.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.959
To me,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.620
she showed more affection.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.159
She was so nice.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.140
How could she murder?

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.299
What's wrong with this world?

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.019
Or perhaps

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.819
I never truly understood her.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.859
Please

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.439
find her.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.859
I want to ask her why

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.859
face-to-face.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.140
Alright.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.060
Let's stop here.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.700
Edit it well.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.020
(Could do something so cruel.)

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.180
(In my eyes,)

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.860
(she was a perfect person.)

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.259
He is too devoted!

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.780
He's probably

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.419
the perfect dream lover

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.360
for countless young women.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.419
Or maybe

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.599
a perfect

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.180
nightmare!

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.819
Master,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.659
I've verified with Mr. Zhang.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.400
He's absolutely certain

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.219
about Lin Xia's blindness.

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.419
Her regained vision later

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.680
is considered a miracle.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.039
Silly Qiang,

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.340
any news on Cheng Nuo?

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:41.819
Not yet.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.639
Probably fled from justice.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:44.759
Otherwise,

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:45.879
why did he abandon

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.620
his hospital?

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.680
He isn't related

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.039
to Lin Xia's case, right?

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.639
Although his wife, Bai Cha

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.740
was suspected dead,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.099
that's unconfirmed.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.219
No need for us

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.199
to search.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.139
We're short-staffed already.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.060
They're unrelated?

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.120
This is too brazen!

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.419
If this photo gets out,

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:15.699
Ye Dong's devoted persona

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:16.620
will collapse.

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:18.639
I get it!

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.840
Cheng Nuo and Lin Xia

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.900
discovered Ye Dong and Bai Cha's affair

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.240
and conspired against Bai Cha.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.099
Master,

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.539
investigate in this direction.

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:27.460
Can't go wrong.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:29.800
Ye Dong,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.759
as the Lin family's live-in son-in-law,

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:32.879
was at others' mercy.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.520
Now he

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.919
is Jiuyao Group's Chairman

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:37.879
and CEO.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.860
He even appointed

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.599
the underqualified Qin Yufei

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.900
as CFO.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.800
Thus,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.340
the biggest beneficiary...

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.800
is him.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.719
Master,

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.039
Cheng Nuo's returned home.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.259
Now apply to Chief

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.159
for a warrant.

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:00.919
Yes!

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:13.840
Bai Cha?

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:16.519
You're Bai Cha?

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.819
Who are you?

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:20.620
Hello.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.180
We're police detectives.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:23.660
Need to verify something

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:25.160
with you and Cheng Nuo.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.620
Okay.

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:27.579
Please come in.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.500
Thank you.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.439
Thank you.

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.279
- Have tea.
- Thanks.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.339
You're

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:40.339
so sensible.

00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:42.392
Just sit.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.060
Mr. Luo,

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.139
why are you here again?

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.699
Mr. Cheng,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.600
what's going on?

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.000
Why is she here?

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:56.699
I've told you many times

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.899
she's

00:04:58.019 --> 00:04:59.060
perfectly fine,

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.579
but you refuse to believe it.

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.180
In Wangjiang Hospital,

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.240
we didn't find her.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:08.740
Can you explain?

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.300
See?

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300
I knew you'd bother her.

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:15.500
That's why

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.319
I called her to move

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.180
to another one.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:20.420
Of course,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.040
I didn't want to cause you trouble.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.540
So

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.459
just brought her back

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.220
and was about to register

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:27.800
at the police station.

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:30.600
I see.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.139
While you were away,

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.519
we visited your hospital many times.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.300
My apologies.

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:45.060
People tend to get nervous in hospitals.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.560
Bai Cha,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.339
do you visit

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.339
your husband's hospital often?

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:51.540
I...

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.459
She's

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:57.019
busy buying purses

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.720
and shopping.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.180
Rarely visits my hospital.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:01.779
Then I suppose

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.620
she doesn't know about

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.459
the square freezer

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.699
in the cold storage.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.379
Honey,

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.079
I remember

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.959
that freezer

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.540
is

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.839
a rectangular one.

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:19.540
Have you

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:20.399
changed it?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.100
Of course not.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:23.000
Remember?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.920
We cleaned that cold storage together.

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.899
Then

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:26.720
sir...

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:29.220
I got it wrong.

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:30.579
You're right.

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:31.699
It is

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:33.259
a rectangular one.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:34.300
Rectangular.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.459
You really

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:38.300
love each other.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.500
There are

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.779
many photos in your office.

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:43.699
Wow.

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:45.019
Plenty at home too.

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:00.019
Such star quality.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.379
This pose

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.379
is so natural.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:05.339
I used to

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:07.060
work at nightclubs.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.620
Hope I didn't embarrass myself.

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:12.000
Alright.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:14.259
I'm leaving.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.699
Got stuff to do.

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:17.560
Master,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.160
should we...

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.040
Should what?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.500
I'll spend time with my daughter.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.139
- I'll see you out.
- Alright.

00:07:23.392 --> 00:07:24.064
This way.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.980
Well,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.019
officers,

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:32.040
we'll stay here.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.379
Alright.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.420
See you.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:38.420
Go in.

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:43.240
They seem quite affectionate.

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:44.519
But

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:46.819
our assumptions might be wrong.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.100
Master,

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:51.120
why didn't you ask
about Ye Dong and Lin Xia?

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:55.420
When prey feels safest

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.779
and most relaxed,

00:07:57.579 --> 00:07:58.939
they'll show their weakness.

00:07:59.279 --> 00:07:59.779
This is

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.139
authenticity through relaxation.

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:02.519
If you ask him,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.240
it's like sounding an alarm.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.660
They can pull off

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.500
a flawless act.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.540
Don't get it.

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:12.259
Bai Cha was right before us.

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:14.339
What are you suspicious about?

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:18.740
I have this strange feeling.

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:21.620
It's like looking

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:22.819
at a perfect puzzle,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.000
but the colors don't

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.120
seem to match.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.000
What's wrong with it?

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:31.040
Haven't figured it out.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.860
And Lin Xia

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.100
has vanished

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.279
without a trace.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.539
Ye Dong

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.000
must be hiding something.

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:41.500
His overly affectionate act

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.340
looks fake to me.

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:46.700
Something might behind

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:48.860
Lin Na's murder.

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:51.940
Master,

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:53.799
I feel

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:54.820
this case

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.000
is like falling into

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.299
a foggy swamp.

00:08:57.539 --> 00:08:58.539
The more I struggle,

00:08:58.539 --> 00:08:59.899
the deeper I sink.

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:01.820
Qiao,

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:05.100
when deceived by appearances,

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.340
trust your instincts.

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:09.740
Trust your inner judgment.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.080
Eyes

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:12.059
can lie.

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:12.980
But your mind

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.799
will let you see clearer.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.039
Dong,

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:32.500
Mrs. Ye is here.

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:35.620
Mom,

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:37.139
like this place?

00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:42.059
Dong,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:42.860
well,

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.440
all these

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:45.399
treasures belong to us now?

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.019
Yes.

00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:48.100
But

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:50.220
stop wearing this outfit.

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:51.779
Now we're

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:53.500
a respectable upper-class family.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.179
Stop wearing it.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.179
What's wrong with this?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.299
This is

00:09:58.299 --> 00:09:59.899
my specially-made divine robe.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.580
Let me tell you.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:03.120
If I hadn't stolen

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.539
Lin's prosperous fate,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.940
we wouldn't be here today.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.320
Mom,

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:10.279
everything I have today

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.019
is earned through my own efforts.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.519
It has nothing to do with you.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.279
Instead, you almost

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:18.059
ruined my plans.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.820
Lin Xia

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:21.299
dared to hit me.

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:23.259
My head still hurts.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.500
Why didn't you bring her corpse back?

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.759
I'll make sure

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:29.500
she never reincarnates!

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:30.340
Enough, Mom.

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:32.019
Stop talking nonsense,

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:33.419
especially at the company.

00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:36.559
Think you're all grown up now?

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.139
Ashamed of me?

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:41.379
No.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.100
Kneel.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.659
Mom!

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:43.539
Kneel!

00:10:59.019 --> 00:10:59.620
Dong!

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.419
Get out!

00:11:02.019 --> 00:11:02.519
Dong!

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.059
Bai Cha has appeared.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.539
Go ahead!

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.659
