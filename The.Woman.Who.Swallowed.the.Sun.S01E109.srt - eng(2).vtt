WEBVTT

00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.070
Sun Jae, Sul Hee, and Se Ri...

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.410
are going to be the owners of this place.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.080
I'm starting over with you.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.380
How dare you...

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.920
Who gave you the right
to treat her this way?

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.920
You abandoned this woman 20 years ago...

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.950
and the child she was carrying
at the time.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.820
What gives you the right
to waltz back in here?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.130
Do things change now
that the daughter you rejected...

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.530
owns Mingang Distribution?

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.760
Why?

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.560
Because Baek Sul Hee and Kim Se Ri
were a burden to you back then,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.070
and now, they've become stepping stones?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.800
Is that why you're crawling back to them?

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.270
Watch your mouth! Who's crawling back?

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.570
You're interfering with my family.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.940
Don't you dare use the word "family."

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.410
You don't even know the first thing
about family.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.850
Family isn't something you just discard
and pick up again when you feel like it.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.050
Family means being there in tough times
and staying together until the end.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.190
By that definition,
you don't deserve to have a family.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.290
You should just live alone and die alone.
That's what you deserve.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.400
You really think saying all that
will make her and my daughter your family?

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.570
Say what you want,
but they'll never be yours.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.500
She's my woman, and Se Ri is my daughter.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.970
No. They have nothing to do
with you anymore.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.470
You can’t even reveal who you really are,
yet you sure talk big!

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.440
Fine by me. Go on, reveal everything!

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.980
I've been wanting to take
this mask off anyway.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.280
Expose that I'm not Moon Tae Kyung,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.450
and that I'm the son of Doeun's CEO,
Han Kyung Soo,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.250
and that my goal is revenge
on Chairman Min Doo Sik!

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.280
Go ahead, reveal it all!

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.360
- You're insane. You've got a death wish.
- Hey, Kim Sun Jae.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.860
Now that I know who you truly are,
I have nothing left to fear.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.930
You want to know why?

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.260
Because without Madam Jang,
Min Kyung Chae, and even Se Ri,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.100
you're incapable of
doing anything on your own.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.240
And I know that all too well.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.770
What did you say?

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.010
Darn it...

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.990
Darn it!

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.800
(Episode 109)

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.540
Why did you do that?

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.310
What if he really exposes
who your parents are?

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.310
It doesn't matter.
Chairman Min is incapacitated,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.750
and as for Min Kyung Chae,
as long as I don't get in her way,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.020
she'll choose to ignore it.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.920
Something's not right with him.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.090
I saw him take off
his engagement ring earlier.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.160
That means he's prepared
to end his engagement with Min Kyung Chae.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.700
Then it's obvious what's happening.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.300
Min Kyung Chae and Madam Jang
were planning to cut him loose.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.970
And Kim Sun Jae must have
found out somehow.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.040
And now he's one step ahead of
the two women...

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.870
who are trying to ditch him
by making his move first.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.140
Plus, he's holding
an unexpected card now, Se Ri.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.550
It's terrifying to even think
about becoming a family with him again.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.520
I won't let that happen.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.520
Getting hurt once was more than enough.
I won't let him hurt you a second time.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.590
Like I said,
Kim Sun Jae doesn't deserve a family.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.160
Someone who only knows how to use people
and does not know how to cherish them...

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.430
is destined to live and die alone.
It's just the natural order of things.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.080
For a nerdy guy, he packs a real punch.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.550
Darn it.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.780
- What's wrong?
- Where are you?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.320
Come to my office now.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.160
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.500
What happened to your face?

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.240
And come to think of it,
your engagement ring is gone too?

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.080
I just took it off for a moment.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.440
Who hit you?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.880
I didn't get hit.
He's the one who got a beating.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.380
So you definitely got in a fight.
Who was it?

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.820
Was it Moon Tae Kyung?

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.630
What are you two, children?
What were you fighting about?

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.430
Honestly, if you were going to fight,
you should've won. Why did you get hit?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.970
(Mingang Distribution)

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.470
What on earth is wrong with him?

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.910
Yes, Mother.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.850
What? Kim Sun Jae is acting up?

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.890
The nerve of him.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.890
I don't know
what's gotten into him lately.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.060
He even took off his engagement ring.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.960
He took the ring off?

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.330
Yes.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.960
He's not even pushing for us
to get married anymore.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.900
It's like
he's a completely different person.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.500
If he's acting like this, it means
he's determined to end the engagement.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.940
So why won't he just leave
instead of dragging his feet?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.570
Does he have some other ace up his sleeve?

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.810
Oh, right. I've scheduled
the shareholders' meeting for next week.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.720
Good. You have to lock
in a date like that.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.320
Otherwise, things just get pushed back.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.520
And make sure you keep
the board members in line...

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.920
so they don't say foolish things.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.220
If someone asks
about Chairman Min Doo Sik,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.990
tell them he's recuperating
somewhere with a nice view.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.500
And while you're at it,
change the Articles of Incorporation.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.240
Make the preparation in advance
so that the articles and the people...

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.340
pave the way for Se Ri to become
the third-generation chairman.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.380
Of course. I'll do as you say, Mother.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.980
I don't want you
in the chairman's seat for long.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.590
- What do you mean?
- Don't you get it?

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.090
You're just a stepping stone for Se Ri,
nothing more.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.990
Enjoy being called "Chairman"
for a few years,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.700
then hand the position over to Se Ri.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.400
(Mingang Distribution)

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.510
I know Se Ri is her own flesh and blood,
but come on.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.180
She's only 20.
What could she possibly know?

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.580
And besides,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.350
why should I have to
hand it over right away?

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.230
- Is something wrong?
- Can I see you in my office for a minute?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.630
You have something to say?

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.030
There's something I need to know,
but since you seem unwilling to tell me,

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.740
- I decided to just ask you myself.
- Fine. Ask me now.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.070
Discussing my future with the company...

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.010
isn't a conversation for the phone, is it?

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.380
Just get to the point.
I'm busy enough as it is.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.820
Busy calling a shareholders' meeting?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.550
So you can have me dismissed.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.720
Then?

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.090
Did you think living in the same house,
working at the same company,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.230
as mother and daughter in private,
and as boss and subordinate in public...

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.600
would last forever?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.270
When the chairman finds out later
what you did while he was unconscious,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.670
he's not going to just let it slide.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.540
Don't you realize it's not your place
to worry about my father right now?

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.610
Why would a divorced woman
worry about her ex-husband?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.880
A divorce isn't over
just because you sign some papers.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.450
You must not know because
you haven't been through one,

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.050
but filing them is required.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.820
What a shame, though.
I filed the papers a while ago.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.790
Then I suppose I'm a complete stranger
to the chairman now?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.560
- Since it's all been legally processed.
- Isn't that the point?

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.470
You've never been stabbed in the back
by someone you trust, have you?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.800
You'll find out how it feels.
It will hurt twice as much.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.050
What's she relying on
that makes her so cocky?

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.760
Where are you? Come to my office now.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.960
What is it?

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.000
It's about my father and Lucia.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.100
You're sure you filed
the divorce papers, right?

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.300
Of course. I'm positive
I told you I took care of it.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.040
Then what is she on about?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.380
Why? Is she getting to you?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.920
She acts like they're still married.
She's so full of herself.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.520
Does she have something up her sleeve?

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.820
The only card she could play
is my father waking up,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.790
but that's impossible.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.130
You're absolutely sure
you handled everything correctly?

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.130
Of course.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.780
You haven't changed a bit.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.580
Tae Joo.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.980
What do you think? Would it be better
for Se Ri if this man lived...

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.950
or if he were to die?

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520
I don't know.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.390
How could I possibly
decide that right now?

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.260
You're right. It's all up to fate.
It's not our place to decide, is it?

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.760
Listen here, Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.430
You're only still here because
I haven't decided what to do with you yet.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.940
It's not out of the goodness of my heart.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.810
Your fate will be sealed soon enough,

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.710
so don't wake up.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.480
Just keep sleeping soundly
like you are now.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.240
Once they decide
whether to kill me or let me live,

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.040
they'll act immediately. Is that it?

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.210
All to make Se Ri the new head of Mingang.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.820
Then I can't just take this lying down.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.290
What are you watching so intently?

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.260
The international news.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.070
Apparently, there was this adoptee
who didn't even know they were adopted.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.400
Then they found their birth mother
and just up and left to be with her.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.770
They just abandoned the mother
who raised them for 20 years overnight.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.010
- That really happened?
- I guess blood is thicker than water.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.980
But what can you do
when they want to be with their own blood?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.050
So what happened to the adoptive mother?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.320
They say she stuck a flower in her hair.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.590
She put a flower in her hair?

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.630
It means she went crazy.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.600
I mean, she doted on that kid all her life
as if they were her own.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.270
If they go to their birth mom overnight
without a second thought,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.870
of course she'd go crazy.
How could she not?

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.510
Goodness.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.580
Ms. Se Ri, no matter what happens,
you can't abandon Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.250
You can't betray her!

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.090
What's gotten into you lately?

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.390
- Why would I betray Kyung Chae?
- Exactly!

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.130
Depending on what you do from here on,

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.160
I might at least lessen my guilt a little.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.260
Did you do something wrong?

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.130
I'm so frustrated!
It's driving me crazy.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.200
This stress is going to be
the death of me.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.310
Is there a field of reeds somewhere?

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.210
I just need to scream,
"The king has donkey's ears!"

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.980
What is going on with you?

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.150
Do you have a secret or something?

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.480
You are my secret.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.920
Your very existence...

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.020
is a secret I have buried for 20 years,
like a punishment from the skies.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.630
There you go again.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.660
Why is it lately when you see me,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.800
you get all teary-eyed
or space out, or sigh?

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.630
Anyway.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.470
Promise me.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.470
That no matter what happens,
you will never leave Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.770
Okay?

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.850
At the shareholders' meeting next week,
Min Kyung Chae, as majority shareholder,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.820
will table a motion for my dismissal,
and it's very likely to pass.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.560
If Chairman Min's dormant shares
could be exercised at a time like this,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.760
we could easily turn
this whole situation around.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.930
But we have no idea
what condition Chairman Min is in.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.930
Don't worry too much.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.010
I'm right here beside you.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.710
The two of us...

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.420
came here for our own separate revenge,
not even knowing each other.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.350
We've been through so much together...

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.250
and have come to understand
each other's pain.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.690
We've even cried together
out of compassion for each other,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.860
and that's how we've made it this far.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.130
Whether Se Ri is your biological daughter
or Kim Sun Jae is her real father,

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.230
nothing will change between us.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.740
My adoptive mother always used to say...

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.110
"A child you take into your heart
becomes your own."

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.580
You were Mi So's mother
until the very end,

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.550
and for that, I'm so grateful.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.620
Think of Se Ri
as gaining another daughter,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.620
not as having lost Mi So.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.630
I guess this is why I like you, Tae Kyung.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.300
You like me?

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.560
You couldn't tell?

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.300
I wouldn't have made it
this far otherwise.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.670
There were more days I cried
than I smiled,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.410
but you were always there,
protecting me like a rock.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.350
Goodness.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.080
You two are getting all lovey-dovey
in the office, are you?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.390
What are you doing here?

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.790
Maybe my fist wasn't persuasive enough.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.690
You're unbelievable.
Even with Chairman Min in his condition,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.790
you have no right to be here
carrying on like this.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.460
And what gives you the right?

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.570
Look, if we're being technical about it,
Chairman Min is her legal husband,

00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:59.740
so I'll give you that.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.440
But I was her first man,
and I'm Se Ri's biological father.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.110
So who are you?

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.940
If you're just here to spout nonsense,
then get out.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.480
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280
Let's take this outside.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.360
You should know
I'm barely holding it together right now.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.770
I'm protecting my woman and daughter,
so I'm keeping quiet.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.040
It's not because I'm scared of you.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.170
Your woman?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840
Your child?

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.170
If you had any shame,
you wouldn't dare say that.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.510
It's a fact that woman is mine.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.880
She'd never been with anyone before me.
I was her first.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.820
And Se Ri? Need I say more?

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.950
She's my spitting image
in every single way.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
It's pathetic how some people cling to
their blood ties.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.000
I'm in love with her.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.170
So much so that my biggest regret is
not stopping her marriage to Chairman Min.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.400
I couldn't stop her...

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.770
because she was so desperate
to avenge her daughter.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.210
It was like she was a moth
drawn to a flame,

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.440
knowing she'd be destroyed.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.640
So what's your point?

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.280
You know what we were to each other.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.720
That's why I'm done with regrets.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.180
You might have been her first man,

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.190
but I'm going to be her last.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.890
You really can't tell that
I'm holding back right now, can you?

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.760
One word from me will finish you both.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.830
One word from me,
and the same goes for you.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.930
Madam Jang is on your side because
she thinks Se Ri is her flesh and blood.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.400
But what happens when she finds out
Se Ri is actually your flesh and blood?

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.310
I can't be sure,
but I bet she'll come after you first.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.580
Do you know why we haven't revealed...

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.310
the fact that
you're Se Ri's biological father?

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.050
Because if Se Ri finds out,
we know how deeply it would hurt her.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.020
I'm not even related,
but I'm worried enough about that child...

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:57.090
to keep my mouth shut.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.090
For you, her own father,
to use this as leverage is just wrong.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.290
What's the matter?

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.960
Did I strike a nerve?

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.030
I see you've got nothing to say.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.840
(Mingang Distribution)

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.440
- Sorry I'm late. Here's our new proposal.
- Okay. By the way,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.250
I need you to run an errand for me.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.520
Sure, what is it? Anything for you.

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.350
I need you to check on
Dad and Lucia's marriage registration.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.620
I need to know for sure
if their divorce has been finalized.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.160
Wait, isn't that what you left Lawyer Kim
to carry out?

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.630
He must've handled it.
That guy would do anything for you.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.900
That's what I thought,
but he's been acting strange lately.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.570
No way.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.370
The sky would fall
before he'd ever betray you.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.110
Still, check it for me anyway.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.540
But isn't that information
only available to the people involved?

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.910
Which is why I'm telling you
to figure it out.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.180
Do I have to do every little thing myself?

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.750
I'm swamped preparing
for the shareholders' meeting next week.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.650
All right, I get it. I'll look into it.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.160
What are you thinking so hard about?

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.470
Can you look up someone's marriage records
if you're not that person?

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.370
Who are you talking about?

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.770
Kyung Chae wants me to check if Dad
and that woman are divorced on paper yet.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.770
I'm sure Lawyer Kim
handled all of that.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.940
That's what I said.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.010
But apparently,
Sun Jae's been acting strange.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.850
Anyway, how do you even find
this stuff out?

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.480
I'll find out for you.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.550
Director Oh can do it in a flash,
so just leave it to me.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:42.960
Were you resting?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.500
Se Ri.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.930
What am I supposed to do with you?

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.540
Should I be happy
that I've found you, even now?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.610
Or should I blame you for Mi So's death,
whom I raised as my own daughter,

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.440
and hate you for it forever?

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.410
Mom, I've been thinking.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.420
It's about what you suggested last time.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.190
I'd like to get a part-time job.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.820
It won't be easy, you know.
Are you sure you can handle it?

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.890
It's better than sitting around
at home doing nothing.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.730
Plus, I'll probably learn a thing or two
from interacting with people.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.600
All my life, I've just been "Ms. Se Ri."
I've never done anything for myself.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.240
So I'm going to give it a try.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.910
That's my girl.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.190
It seems like that young man in that room
is a pretty big deal at his company.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.190
Where did that come from?

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.590
The CEO and the chairman
are the important ones.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.400
A director is nothing special.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.360
Ja Kyung said...

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.770
the young mother-in-law,
who is the acting chairman,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.870
relied heavily on that young man.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.240
What kind of
ridiculously absurd story is that?

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.170
If she has to rely on someone,
it should be Ji Seop.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.480
Why a complete stranger?

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.380
That just goes to show how capable
and good-natured he is.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.610
However great he is,
she shouldn't be acting that way.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.780
Her husband is lying on his deathbed,

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.420
and what if this starts some nasty rumors?

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.060
Nasty rumors? Like what?

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.690
Like a man and a woman getting together?

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.190
I've never once seen
a man and a woman get that close...

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.960
without trouble starting.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.430
And she's a young woman, isn't she?

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.700
At that rate, a huge scandal
is bound to break out.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.200
Oh, please. You should talk.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.340
- You think he's anything like you?
- What about me?

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.810
I've turned a blind eye time and again,
whether I knew what was going on or not.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.310
Like that whole thing with you
and Ms. Stella, or whatever her name is.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.180
My dear wife.
Why are you bringing that up now?

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.420
Our relationship is purely professional.
There's nothing romantic going on.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.190
Oh, sure. Of course, it's not a romance.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.890
What crazy woman would want a romance
with that mug of yours?

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.260
Only a fool like me with no taste.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.200
If it weren't for these wrinkles,
I'd have women falling all over me.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.430
And stop dragging Ms. Stella into this.
She's not that kind of woman.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.000
She's elegant, luxurious, and beautiful.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.170
Oh, for crying out loud.
So you like "elegant," do you?

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.080
Anyway, you just try anything
with that woman, romantic or otherwise.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.380
And you'll see me come at you
with everything I've got.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.180
I'll come at both of you!

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.990
And do what? Will you headbutt me?
Like this?

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.020
- How are you not hurt?
- I've built up a tolerance!

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.230
Goodness...

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.030
Hey, Se Ri. It's Mom.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.600
It's about what we talked
about last night.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.970
You mentioned you wanted
to get a part-time job.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.600
You haven't changed your mind about that,
have you?

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.240
Of course not.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.470
Did you think
I'd change my mind overnight?

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.940
Good. Then come to the office today.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.040
I've found some places,

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.580
and I'll set you up
so you can start right away.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.110
Today? Right away?

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.450
Why? You don't want to?

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.250
No, that's not it. I'll be there.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.490
So, where should I meet you later?

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.790
I know that place.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.330
Okay, I'll see you there later then.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.380
Grandma? Why are you calling again?

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.080
You could at least sound happy to hear me.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.020
What's with the attitude?

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.750
I asked what you wanted.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.420
I just wanted to see you.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.890
Do you want to meet up?
I'll buy you something delicious. Come on.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.030
I can't today.
I have to go meet my mom later.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:38.900
Your mom?

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.030
Why are you meeting her outside?
You see her at home all the time.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.140
That's none of your business.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.210
Anyway, I'm hanging up.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.220
Lucia, what on earth is she up to?

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.550
Don't tell me...

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.160
she's planning on hurting my Se Ri,
is she?

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.960
Tae Joo, go over to Se Ri's place
and tail her for me.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.600
Lucia asked to meet her.
Find out what they're up to.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.170
Sure.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.880
Wait, you want me to wait tables here?

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.680
Why? You think you can't handle it?

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.050
You think you're too good for it
because it's hard work?

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.080
No, it's not that.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.990
I've never done anything like this before.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.960
No one's born knowing
how to do this stuff.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.590
Lots of people do this kind of work
to pay for school...

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.530
or support their families.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.260
At least you don't have to worry
about that.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.100
Think of it as a life experience
and give it a try.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.340
For how long?

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.870
For as long as you can last.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.880
Do I have to wear this?

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:00.310
Yes.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:06.280
You won't last long in those heels.
You'll twist an ankle.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.650
Change into some comfortable sneakers.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.520
So, what's the pay?

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.390
Ten dollars an hour?

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:13.690
What?

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.390
I could work my butt off all month
and not even afford a single handbag.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.310
What? My Se Ri is doing what?

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.980
Waiting tables in some tiny cafe?

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.580
And for only ten dollars an hour?

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.650
- It seems like she's dead set on it.
- That crazy witch!

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.490
Who is she, working my girl to the bone?
She's too precious for that!

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:48.430
Now that she's the acting chairman,
she's on a total power trip.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.160
Tae Joo, that's it.
Take me to Mingang Distribution.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.860
- To see Lucia?
- Will you stop calling her that?

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.770
(Mingang Distribution)

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.760
What is this all of a sudden?

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.910
"When the cat's away, the mice will play."

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.510
That's exactly you.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.080
Just because Min Doo Sik is in that state,
do you think you're somebody now?

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.010
Sitting there in the chairman's office,

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.810
hearing people address you
as the acting chairman,

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.680
you think the world is at your feet,
don't you?

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.390
Watch what you say.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.660
You're the one who should watch it.
What did you do to my Se Ri?

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.690
It makes my blood boil just to know
you see her morning and night at home.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.730
Don’t you feel sorry for that girl...

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.730
who follows you like her real mom,

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.700
while you're hiding your claws
like a fox ready to pounce?

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.140
Don't you feel sorry for her...

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.770
when her mother is actually her sister,
so she can’t call her Mom?

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.710
And yet to a child like that,
you did what?

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.840
Make her wait tables?

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.750
Who do you think you are?

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.480
Who said you can make my granddaughter
do such a menial job?

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.550
- Who do you think you are to my girl?
- Please, stop.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.860
Who do you think you are...

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.890
I said that's enough!

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.230
Let go of me!

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.130
Se Ri isn't a special girl to you.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.130
So, please stop.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:38.370
What are you talking about?

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.210
(Mingang Distribution)

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.380
I heard you were wondering
if Dad and Lucia were legally divorced,

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.050
and if everything was finalized, right?

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:54.720
Is that what Ji Seop told you?

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.990
You have to ask the right person
for that kind of favor.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.220
Like he'd ever actually look into it.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.460
So you looked into it instead?

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:04.830
Then just get to the point.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.600
So what's the verdict?

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.670
Unfortunately, it's not the news
you were hoping for.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.840
Dad and Lucia are still legally married,

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.110
so if Dad passes away,

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.840
the person who stands
to inherit the most...

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.680
is still that woman.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.540
What?

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.680
Is that really true?

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.320
See for yourself.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.190
(Certificate of Marriage)

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.790
(Name: Min Doo Sik, Spouse: Jung Lucia)

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.800
Oh, perfect timing.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.570
Explain this to me right now.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:54.780
Tell me why those two are still married!

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.860
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.050
I'm doing things my way
for my life and the remaining years.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.680
My new beginning
includes Baek Sul Hee and Kim Se Ri.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.350
Madam Jang is out of her mind right now.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.120
If we just let her go on like this,
something much worse is going to happen.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.920
We have to stop Madam Jang
from going off the rails.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:40.990
Lucia said she was going
to report me to the police.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.060
If she reports you, then so be it.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.630
If you don't like that,
then just tell us where the chairman is.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.200
You know exactly what I'm about to tell
Se Ri about Lucia, don't you?

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.910
