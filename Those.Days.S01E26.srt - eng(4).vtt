00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.420
(Jianqi,)

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.620
(we said we'd play)

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.500
(a duet at the wedding.)

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.340
(Now, come play it with me.)

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.860
(Let's give this happiness)

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.980
(to Zhidong and Bichen.)

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.760
It's beautiful.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.980
(Xu's Wedding, Mr. Xu and Ms. Yuan)

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.460
Thank you for helping me out today.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.700
That was so awkward.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.660
If I'd had to go up there,
it would've been a disaster.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.940
How was my hosting skill?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.020
You were so good.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.460
You play the piano well.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.580
I was just messing around.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.060
They're here.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.340
Dr. Li.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.100
Thank you for everything.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.740
Mingzhu.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.100
You too, Ni.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.260
Come on.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.780
Congratulations on your wedding!

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.820
Be good to her.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.650
I will. I'm going to drink
with my parents now.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.380
Mom and Dad!

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.180
Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.260
Uncle and Aunt.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.100
Here's to you.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.340
Yes! Yes!

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.900
Congratulations!

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.700
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.460
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.300
Drink.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.460
Drink.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.260
Today is a good day.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.900
Yes.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.620
I'm not going

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.740
to say much,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.980
it's all in the wine.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.820
Yes, yes.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.250
Bottoms up!

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.570
- Easy there, Mom.
- Empty the glass.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.220
Finish it.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.460
Yes, finish it.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.980
Finish it.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.940
Mom,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.500
your cheeks are red. Go easy on it.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.380
I'm okay.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.180
Tell him to go easy too.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.220
Relax.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.820
Let's all sit down.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.780
Let's sit down.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.260
Come on.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.980
Thanks for coming, everyone.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.420
I don't know what to say,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.460
so please enjoy the food.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.860
Xu Dacheng and I

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.020
will toast to you.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.820
Yes, we will.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.980
Come on, Xu Dacheng.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.780
They are having quite a lot to drink.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.420
How about I give you a ride home later?

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.920
You're not going back to the hospital?

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.660
No.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.380
Sure.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.380
Come on.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.220
Cheers!

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.340
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.940
Mrs. Xu,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.340
you're so blessed!
Your son and your daughter are with you.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.100
You're wrong.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.820
Not just one daughter,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.780
two daughters.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.460
I have two daughters and a son.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.860
She's pretty, mature,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.260
and filial.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.540
What are they talking about?

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.540
The girl who played the piano earlier,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.180
she's our daughter too.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.540
She's amazing.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.140
Come on.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.500
Shengli,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.740
we must share a drink tonight.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.820
Come on!

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.820
Bottoms up!

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.620
Yes, finish your glass!

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.060
Shengli, finish it!

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.020
Come on, drink it.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.140
Drink.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.140
Don't drink it.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.140
You've had enough.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.820
Don't drink it.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.280
You see, someone like me...

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.020
Good capacity.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.500
My capacity is average,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.460
but my courage is top three.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.380
And my drinking etiquette
is second to none.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.300
Yes.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.380
You have good capacity
and great courage.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.660
Still, I need to remind you,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.340
Xu Dacheng,

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.740
that girl is our daughter.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.980
I know, I know.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.300
Now, I'm not one to criticize,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.900
but you can't let your wife

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.140
make all the decisions.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.740
Xiu'e, listen,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.380
a family

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.380
must have a man to steer the ship.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.900
That's right.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.500
You're

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.940
keeping my friend
here under your control.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.900
Is that appropriate?

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.220
Not appropriate.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.940
That's right.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.140
The man handles outside affairs,
the woman manages the home.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.500
Yes.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.500
That's the rule.
It shouldn't be flipped.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.660
That's right.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.660
That's funny.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.260
In our house, it's been flipped

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.180
the other way around for years.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.540
And how's life been?

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.180
Great.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.980
Great, right?

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.660
We're doing great.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.380
No, no.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.060
There are some things women

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.380
just can't handle as well as men.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.980
That's right.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.500
You see, in my house,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.220
I have the final say
on every major decision.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.220
That's right.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.020
Don't let her loud voice fool you.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.740
I'm the one backing her up from behind,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.460
you know?

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.820
Let me show you something.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.580
That's right.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.540
No, I don't want it.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.060
- Just eat it.
- No.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.140
No.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.220
Look at this.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.820
Look here.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.060
Look here.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.020
You get it now?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.500
I've been holding onto
this for safekeeping.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.860
If she ever found out,
all hell would break loose.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.900
Xu Dacheng, you think you can scare me

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.180
with some useless paper?

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.380
She's slamming the table.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.300
You've gone too far.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.860
From now on,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.460
stay away from us.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.020
We're done. No more contact!

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.940
We're going home, Shen Shengli!

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.820
Shen Mingzhu!

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.900
You're coming home with us!

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.700
Oh, no. My mom just called me by my full name.
It can't be good.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.180
What's wrong, Mrs. Shen?

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.780
Mrs. Shen?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.740
Xu...

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.780
In-law.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.740
So this is a trap for us.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.020
Coming!

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.460
Please excuse us.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.300
- What's going on?
- Come on!

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.820
Why are you leaving?

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.260
(Shen's Restaurant)
See? Now you've caught a chill.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.700
You rushed out of there so fast.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.140
You see?

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.220
They're just treating us like fools!

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.580
We even gave them
such a big red envelope.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.500
And you still say I'm the foolish one?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.860
Who's actually being stupid here?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.140
Didn't you see what was going on today?

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.950
Getting mixed up with that
family is like asking for trouble.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.180
And that brother of hers,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.260
standing there in front of everyone,

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.740
calling her sister.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.100
Her parents were pretending to be drunk.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.220
They had the paternity test

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.140
ready all along!

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.020
What did I tell you?

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.980
It's a setup!

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.420
You keep telling me I'm paranoid.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.820
You're the one who's clueless.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.340
Lower your voice.
Mingzhu might hear you.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.060
He keeps saying
"she's their biological child."

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.140
So what?

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.300
Does it count if you
don't even raise her?

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.420
They gave her away!

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.660
They didn't want her!

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.940
We worked so hard to raise that child!

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.980
She's right next door. Keep it down.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.220
Mom, don't be upset.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.340
Drink your medicine
while it's still warm.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.180
Mingzhu,

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.420
I know I didn't give birth to you,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.260
but I did raise you.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.300
I can't bear the thought of losing you.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.500
You can't acknowledge them.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.060
You...

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.940
That family is no good.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.900
You stay away from them.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.540
We can't win against them,
but we can avoid them, okay?

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.820
Okay, I'll do as you say.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.580
We'll all do as you say.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.500
Shut up!

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.580
Don't be mad anymore.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.940
(Until someone told me)

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.220
(that Flying Tiger Capital plans)

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.060
(to sell Wildfire within the year.)

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.020
(Who kind of man is Sheng Jiangchuan?)

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.420
(I'm sure you've heard of him.)

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.930
(His nickname is "Sheng the Wrecker.")

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.460
(And how did he get that nickname?)

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.700
(By tearing companies apart)

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.140
(and sucking them dry.)

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:43.700
Okay.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.140
Sell it.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.180
(No matter how big the company is,)

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.260
(once it's in his hands,)

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.580
(it won't escape the fate
of being sold off.)

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.470
(I heard someone say
I was selling off company)

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.220
Who was it?

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.260
Zhang.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.060
He was asking about the inventory.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.260
Feng,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.980
are you hiding something from me?

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.700
What do you mean?

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.580
The bank just texted me

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.820
a payment reminder.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.260
It's really nothing.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.380
Once I clear out the inventory,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.700
the problem will be solved.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.020
Don't worry.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.460
Really?

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.020
That's good.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.110
Listen, if something really is wrong,

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.940
you have to tell me.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.580
We'll face it together.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:47.740
Lihua,

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.260
business is very tough right now.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.700
It's exhausting.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.820
Money isn't so easy
to come by anymore.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.980
From now on, we have

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.560
to be more careful with our spending.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.780
I got it.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:17.660
Listen,

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.140
you can only eat the egg white.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.620
No yolk. Your cholesterol
and lipids are high.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.140
Okay, I'll be careful.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.900
Here, Meiqi.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.580
I have no appetite.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.460
What's wrong now?

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.900
Today's the last day
of our company assessment.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.550
I'm the only one who
didn't hit the target.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.940
I might get fired soon.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.180
How much more do you need?

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.060
A hundred thousand.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.180
Alright. Go to work.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.540
I'll transfer it to you later.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.420
Really?

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.700
Thank you, Daddy!

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.220
Look at you, so dramatic.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.180
Spending big when I need it the most!

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.740
Meiqi,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.720
I can help you get started,
give you a little push.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.460
But the journey ahead is long,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.520
you'll have to walk it on your own.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.020
I got it.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.740
Don't worry.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.500
I'm going to work now..

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.020
Okay.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.220
Stay safe.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.060
Thanks, Daddy!

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.700
Look at that girl.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.900
Will she

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.860
ever grow up?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.020
Bye!

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.620
Okay, stay safe!

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.850
So the inventory problem's
been taken care of?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.020
More or less.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.500
Morning, Samantha.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.260
Morning.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.700
Meiqi.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.700
Wouldn't it be easier to just
inherit the family business?

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.660
Why put yourself through
the grind here with us?

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.540
You're the only one
who hasn't hit your numbers.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.560
You're not hurting for money,

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.900
but the rest of the team

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.060
actually depends on this job

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.300
to make a living.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.180
Before I close out today,

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.380
I'll hit my KPIs.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.540
Samantha,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.740
Meiqi hit her target.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.140
How did she pull that off?

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.860
She topped up 100,000 yuan
on her own membership card.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.620
(Lijun Hotel KPI Performance Sheet)

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.340
So she

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.700
bought her way into the rankings.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.060
Samantha,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.540
I've completed my KPI.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.180
Not bad.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.060
Catching the train
at the very last minute.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.180
But I'm getting off now.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.900
Here's my resignation letter.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.020
Goodbye, Samantha.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.060
Whose turn is it?

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.460
Let's drink!

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.620
Cheers!

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.500
Let's play!

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.100
Come on!

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.780
- 15, 20, none.
- 15, 20, 15.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.260
15, 20, 10.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:32.940
20.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.700
Drink!

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.020
I lost. I'll drink.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.980
You have to admit,

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.940
money really is a wonderful thing.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.500
Look at a family like ours.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.660
With a rich father behind her,

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.380
as soon as Meiqi
topped up her card,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.450
her manager sent her on
a business trip to Shanghai.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.940
If you ask me,

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.660
that manager is just so opportunistic.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.700
Meiqi's actually capable on her own.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.300
We're just giving her a boost now.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.500
The road ahead, she'll
have to walk on her own.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.380
Mingzhu.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.900
- Come join us.
- You're back, Mingzhu.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.930
- We've been waiting for you.
- I'm home.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.420
Let's eat.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.700
I brought back some plum
blossom cakes from our hotel.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.660
They're delicious.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.060
I wanted you to try them.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.260
Plum blossom cakes?

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.550
- This pastry...
- They look wonderful.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.500
- It's Meiqi's favourite.
- Let's eat.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.140
It's a shame she's on a
business trip to Shanghai.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.260
We'll save some for her.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.340
Didn't she resign?

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.930
Why would they send
her on a business trip?

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.580
Who?

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.780
Resigned?

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.300
You didn't know?

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.060
No.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.460
How did you find out?

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.100
She posted it on her Moments.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.820
On her Moments?

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.620
There's nothing here.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.850
Same here. I don't see anything.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.500
(Shanghai, here I come)

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.540
Let me see yours.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.300
(Freedom is human nature, and quitting
is my decision. Shanghai, here I come.)

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.700
She blocked us.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.300
(Dad)

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.600
Someone's calling you.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.420
I have to take this.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.020
Go ahead.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.020
Come on.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:08.860
Let's keep drinking!

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:10.940
Finish it!

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.380
Hello, Dad.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.220
Feng Meiqi!

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.100
Listen to me!

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.380
I don't care where you are,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.420
I don't care how you do it

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.540
I want you to come home right now,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.140
this instant!

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.140
So irresponsible!

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.100
Absolutely zero sense of responsibility!

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:45.900
Meiqi,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.820
I gave you that money

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.340
to help you establish
yourself in your career,

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.220
not for you to become some hotel VIP!

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.600
What are you showing off for?

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.100
Anyone can spend money!

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.660
Do you need to study abroad in England

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.340
to learn how to spend money?

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.340
Do you really

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.700
need to quit your job just
to blow 100,000 yuan?

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.540
Honey,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.100
when will you grow up

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.820
and start sharing

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.820
the burden for this family,
for me, for your mother?

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.060
What you need right now
isn't ways to spend money.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.700
You need to learn how to earn it,

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.020
honey.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.540
That's enough.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.180
You've made her cry.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.740
Why are you being so harsh on her?

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.340
We work ourselves

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.900
half to death for our kids.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.620
Our son is gone,

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.380
and Meiqi is all we have left.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.580
Why should she have to
suffer and endure hardship?

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.180
Enough!

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.760
She's like this because you spoil her.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.260
And exactly because our son is gone,

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.700
Meiqi needs to learn to grow up.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.860
Our family will need her

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.900
in the future.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.380
She's just a girl.
What burden is she supposed to carry?

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.660
Isn't that what you are for?

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.540
We have you.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.580
Where are you going?

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.020
Feng?

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.260
Feng?

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.380
Don't cry.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.580
Alright, don't cry.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.140
Stop crying.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.900
Meiqi, Dad only said those things
for your own good.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.580
Think about it, you've got the degree,
you've got the experience.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.340
You can definitely
land something better.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.540
I don't want to find a job!

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.300
Why are you yelling?

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.810
I'll just find a husband
with a rich family!

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.060
One that will shelter me
from hardship and worry,

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.660
and give me a family heirloom!

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.020
Meiqi...

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.060
Hang on,

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.900
what's that supposed to mean?

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.860
The literal meaning!

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.740
It's not English.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.750
What don't you understand?

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.100
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.220
Mom,

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.580
to be honest, I've been walking
on eggshells wearing this bracelet.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.900
I'm giving it back to you now,

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.540
so Meiqi won't feel uncomfortable.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.500
Mingzhu...

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.020
Meiqi didn't mean that.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.740
- I meant it.
- Don't...

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.300
I meant every word of it!

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.300
Meiqi...

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.980
Why?

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.540
Why is it that after Jianqi passed away,

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.660
all you care about is your grandson?

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.620
You spend so much money on him
without any hesitation,

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.420
but you make a huge deal out of
spending 100,000 on me?

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.140
Weren't you the ones who said

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.580
I was your favorite daughter?

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.100
That you'd take care
of me my whole life?

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.060
So why?

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.620
Why is everything I do wrong now?

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.300
Why is it always my fault?

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.220
The fault is all mine.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.660
Mingzhu?

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:15.980
Mingzhu.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.340
Mom.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.140
It's raining so heavily.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.660
I've been calling Dad,

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.650
but he's not picking up.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.420
I'm getting worried.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.180
I want to go find him in the factory.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.620
I'll go with you.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.500
Okay.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:27.880
Let's go.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.500
I don't know what's going on with him.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.860
I've been calling.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.380
I...

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.940
And he's not answering.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.060
Mom.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:39.980
You should stay home.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.100
I'll go with Mingzhu instead.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.180
Are you sure?

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.060
We'll be fine. Don't worry.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.340
Call me when you find Dad.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.700
Okay, don't worry.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:50.780
Dad?

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.650
Dad, why aren't you...

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.460
- Dad!
- Dad!

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.420
Are you okay?

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.420
- Dad?
- Dad?

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.020
What's wrong?

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:01.820
Dad?

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.380
Dad?

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:10.900
Hello.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.660
Jianmei Workshop! Hurry!

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.220
Dad?

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.180
(Forever in our memory
- In loving remembrance)

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.460
Dad,

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.100
I actually went to Shanghai this time

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.620
for an interview.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.140
I passed.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.820
I just wanted to make you proud.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.340
(Forever in our memory)

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.540
I'm sorry.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.380
Here, have some water.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.060
Okay.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.620
Thank you.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.420
Oh, Feng,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.660
gone before he was even sixty.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.460
It's so sudden.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.660
How will the family manage now?

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.380
Nothing but misfortune
for the Fengs lately.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:01.780
Good thing

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.460
Feng did business for so many years,

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.980
at least he left something behind.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.340
And thank goodness for
his new daughter-in-law.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:10.980
She's handling everything,

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.140
inside and out, all by herself.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.580
The funeral was quite dignified.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.500
Yes.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.860
It hasn't been easy for her.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.380
Elders,

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.950
you've been here all night,
you must be exhausted.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.760
We've bought some
steamed buns and soy milk.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.380
Please eat something first.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.500
Here.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.060
Here, eat something.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.340
Please eat something.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.500
Aunt.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.060
How's my mom?

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.660
It's one tragedy after another.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.950
It's too much for her to take it.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.340
Aunt,

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.300
eat something.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.540
I have no appetite.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.980
Why is fate being so hard
on your and my sister?

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.500
Mingzhu,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.380
my sister has collapsed.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.620
Meiqi is young

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.700
and unreliable.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.580
This family is counting on you now.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.580
You have to hold on, alright?

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.540
And you're pregnant.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.780
You must take care of yourself.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.500
Don't worry, Aunt.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.260
I'm alright.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.340
Your father-in-law was a good man.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.900
And just like that, he's gone.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.500
Mingzhu,

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.700
we need to give him

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.780
a proper funeral.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.860
He was a respectable man.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.540
We should send him
off with dignity too,

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.420
okay?

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.620
Don't worry, Aunt.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.500
I'll make sure it's done properly.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.140
Thank you, Mingzhu.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.780
A lavish funeral?
What does "lavish" mean?

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.260
It means spend like crazy.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:21.860
Spend like crazy?

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.650
The Feng family's main pillar is gone.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.550
What's the point of a lavish funeral?

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.980
The living still need to survive.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.780
That's right.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.100
And Mingzhu has a baby

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.380
on the way to think about.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:38.860
This won't do.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.660
I'll go talk to Jianqi's mother.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.500
I'll talk to her.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.940
She's probably not thinking clearly,

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.300
listening to all those relatives

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.140
spouting nonsense.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.780
- I'm going to.
- Where are you going?

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.500
You always have to stick your nose in.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.740
If you go now

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.340
and tell them to be frugal,

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.740
you're just asking for an earful.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.540
I mean,

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.700
they have to consider their future.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.940
Mingzhu is pregnant now.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.900
She's not thinking straight.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.820
You can't just think
about yourself right now.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.340
You...

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.060
They're overwhelmed
with funeral arrangements.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.180
What are you planning to do?

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.900
Go start a fight?

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.780
Think of a way to actually help.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:11.060
You...

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.180
Mom, Dad,

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.060
how about

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.540
we consult Ni Debao?

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.940
((Ni's Clinic,
Full-Service Funeral Arrangements)

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.620
Funerals,

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.620
let's be honest, are
really for the living.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.100
It's life's final stop.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.300
Once you close your eyes
and breathe your last breath, it's over.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.180
My take?

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.940
However the family feels most
at peace, that's how you do it.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.100
Good point.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.900
- Exactly.
- So right.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.700
No wonder they say Debao

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.820
is the top dog in the funeral business.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.500
Oh, quit it, quit it.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.980
I know what you're really saying.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.980
Don't spend too much money,

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.940
but don't skimp on the ceremony either.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.540
We can't give the Feng family relatives

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.780
any reason to nitpick.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.540
Do I have that right?

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:03.980
Mom,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.740
stop worrying.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.140
Once Mingzhu's
father-in-law is laid to rest,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.660
I'll take you to see her.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.980
You'll take me?

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.320
Who dares go over there right now?

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.860
That Yue Xiu'e, one minute she's nice,
the next she's a nightmare.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.020
Honestly, I'm scared of her myself.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.780
If we push her too far,

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.780
she might not

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.460
let us see Mingzhu anymore.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.500
What would we do then?

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:28.940
You startled me.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.060
What are you talking about?

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.540
Let her try!

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.540
She wouldn't dare!

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.540
Dad,

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.560
if Chen was here, you yelling like that
might scare her into early labor.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.300
Listen to your father,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.180
all bark, no bite.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.560
Strong only at home, got it?

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.410
Fine then, Xu Dacheng,
if you've got the guts,

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.740
go get Mingzhu back for me.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.700
Go on.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.140
Yu Jingxiang,

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.460
things were going just fine.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.660
It's because you lost your cool.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.780
So now it's all my fault?

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.180
- Whose fault should it be?
- Yours.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.900
How is it my fault?

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.500
Of course it's your fault.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.660
If you hadn't gone to jail back then...

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.580
Arguing, arguing, always arguing!

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.140
She's...

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.140
If arguing solved anything,

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.300
you could go fight at the
funeral home right now.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.100
Go yell

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.340
until Mingzhu's father-in-law
comes back alive.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.580
He was the backbone
of their whole family.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.260
Well, we...

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.820
We're not that capable.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.620
Let's go back to eating.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.780
Why is life so hard on Mingzhu?

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.300
She was taken away when she was tiny

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.620
and grew up without her real mom,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.260
right?

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.180
Finally, she grows up

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.340
and marries into a good family.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.240
But then, the Feng family

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.900
lost a son, then lost the father.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.580
It's just...

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.500
Do you think there's a problem
with their feng shui?

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.420
Should they move?

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.220
Could be.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.580
I heard when a house is too big,
it can't hold its energy.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.580
That's right.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.620
Our house is good.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.540
It's not too big,
so it holds the energy well.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.020
Yes.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.220
We've lived here for decades.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.460
Dad went to jail.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.210
Little sister got given away.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.210
Little brother's useless.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.260
And me?

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.540
Nothing impressive at all.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.380
You tell me,
is our feng shui good or not?

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.220
Is it good?

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.140
Look at it this way instead.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.620
Dad changed his ways,

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.460
little sister came home, the useless
brother got married and is having a kid,

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.500
and I'm about to
have my second child.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.290
Now tell me, is that
good feng shui or not?

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.500
- Of course it's good.
- Is it good?

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.700
Of course it is.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.060
Life has its ups and downs,

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.380
that's perfectly normal.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.220
Don't blame everything on feng shui,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.180
that's so superstitious.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.300
I think Mingzhu's place is great.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.020
Really great.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.020
I love it.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.290
Other than being expensive,
there's nothing wrong with it.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.620
(In loving remembrance)

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.820
The mighty river flows ever eastward,

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.460
A soul departs on a journey
with no return.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.580
Bow.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.620
Bow again.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.620
Final bow.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.820
(Forever in our memory
- In loving remembrance)

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.140
Please accept our condolences.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.020
We will now proceed to the funeral home.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.480
This is the place.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.340
This is it.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.020
Everyone's here.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.180
Is everyone here?

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.020
Who's in charge of this family now?

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.570
The person who calls
the shots, step forward!

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.620
Come talk to us.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.420
What is this about?

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.060
Is it you?

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.920
We're here for the debt.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.060
Feng Zhi owed all of us money.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.260
If we don't get paid today,

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.340
nobody's burying anybody.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.820
No one leaves.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.740
You mustn't block
the path of the departed.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.340
Blocking it will bring trouble
upon your family.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.060
And who are you

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.020
to lecture us?

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.260
Cut the superstitious nonsense.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.420
That's superstitious.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.580
Let them finish.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.620
Feng's factory has been insolvent

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.220
since the year before last.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.780
He's been robbing Peter to pay Paul.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.380
We suppliers didn't

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.420
have the heart to press him.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.410
We thought he'd turn things around.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.340
But before anything turned around,
he was gone.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.020
Heart attack.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.700
No one,

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.420
no one saw this coming.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.140
- Do you understand now?
- Listen to me,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.260
he owes me hundreds of thousands.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.180
I want that money today.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.220
Hundreds of thousands?

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.220
He took 12 machines from me.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.020
That's a few million right there.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.620
And I haven't seen a single cent back.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.180
You hear me?

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.300
I'm getting an explanation today.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.180
- Do you hear me?
- When are you paying us?

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:12.820
When we compared notes,

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.580
we realized the truth,

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.420
Feng's factory was an empty shell.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.780
Yes, an empty shell.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:19.860
That's impossible!

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.180
How is it impossible?

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.980
My dad never said
the company had any problems!

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.060
You think he'd tell you?

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.340
Don't be naive, girl.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.220
You must be the princess
who blows money.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.660
- You can't say that.
- Am I right?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.950
- Why would your dad tell you?
- Why can't I say that?

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.860
Would telling you have gotten him

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:33.900
money or manpower?

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.700
You can't talk to her like that.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.700
Are you a Feng?

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.180
If not, shut up!

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.580
I'm a Feng, let me say something.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.220
Are you paying?

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:40.740
You...

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.980
If not, shut up too!

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.300
So you're causing a scene
at my dad's funeral?

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.820
Even if I had the money,
I wouldn't give it to you now!

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.480
What can you do about it?

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.860
Let's talk this through!

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.660
No one's going anywhere
till we get paid!

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.580
Please listen to me!

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.860
Please calm down, guys.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.100
Calm down.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.900
This is the Feng family's funeral.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.140
Does making a scene

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.620
solve anything?

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.060
Look,

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.940
Feng didn't just owe all of you money.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.580
He owed me money too,

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.780
and not any less than yours.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.380
Wang,

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.100
why are you still defending them then?

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.620
What's wrong with you?

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.980
The Feng family representative

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.380
is standing right here.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.180
Can we at least hear her out first?

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.580
Hear what she has to say?

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.420
Alright, alright, go ahead.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.660
- Go ahead.
- Let's hear it.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.860
We were all his friends, weren't we?

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.540
If we owe you money,

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.340
we won't deny it.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.300
But now is not
the time to settle accounts.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.740
Let us lay my father-in-law
to rest first.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.420
After that, we will
go through everything

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.660
and settle it with each of you.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.460
You all know

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.500
what kind of man he was.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:50.980
If you didn't trust him,

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.060
you wouldn't have lent him
your hard-earned money.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.700
He's gone now.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.460
The dead deserve their dignity.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.100
So I'm asking all of you,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.820
please let our family

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.060
finish this funeral properly

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.100
and let us say goodbye to him, okay?

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.380
I give you my word,

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.460
we will

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.180
pay you back every cent,

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.720
even if we have to
sell everything we own.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.500
The sun rises in the east
and sets in the west,

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.540
The departed has left,
never to return.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.020
Feng Zhi,

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.980
we are here to see you
on your final journey.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:44.540
May you rest in peace.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.060
(Blessings)

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.100
(Grave of Feng Zhi)
Returning to one's roots in death,

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.820
the spirit returns to its homeland.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.900
Mr. Feng Zhi,

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.780
may you rest in peace.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.980
Girl, girl.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.700
Offer a toast to your father.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.180
Dad,

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.820
I won't get to toast you anymore.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.260
Please have a drink.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.620
(In loving remembrance)

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.700
This is our family photo.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.380
Please don't forget us.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.780
And your favorite fountain pen.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.180
Blue-black ink.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.260
I filled it for you.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.340
And your phone.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.660
Meiqi,

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.140
we need to keep the phone.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.950
We'll need it to settle accounts
with the creditors.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.900
Drums echo through the valley,
all rites return to one.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.340
Family members, please bow
before the tombstone.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.220
Please bow.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.420
Bow again.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.380
Final bow.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.220
The ceremony is complete.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.860
Family and friends may now
come forward to offer incense.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.020
Hello.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.860
Hello, are you Feng Zhi's family?

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.380
I am.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.100
Who is this?

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:23.780
Here's the thing.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.100
The mortgage for Unit 8001, Block 6,

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.340
Xin City Grand Court is overdue.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.780
We paid for that apartment in full.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.700
There is no mortgage.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.580
It's a collateral loan.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.620
This property was mortgaged
for two million last year.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.140
Can you put me in touch with Mr. Feng?

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:43.860
Hi.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.380
Are you the family member?

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.500
This is the itemized bill.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:50.620
I'll need your signature.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.420
Okay.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.100
This isn't right.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.900
When we bought the plot,

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.140
the headstone was included in the price.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.380
Why are there all these extra charges?

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.060
The engraving, the porcelain photo,

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.380
the gold-leaf detailing

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.380
are separate fees.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.060
Don't worry,

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.780
everything is clearly priced.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.380
Hang on,

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.380
everything was supposed to be included.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.900
And today's burial ceremony,

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.220
we handled that ourselves.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.540
So where did

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.900
(Burial service)
this 1,888 yuan service fee come from?

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.300
Yes.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.700
It's true you did

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:23.740
the ceremony yourselves,

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.180
but we provided

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.900
the electric cart, set up the tent, and
handled the guiding services.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.260
Those things come with charges.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.740
The headstone itself is included,

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.940
but engraving costs extra.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.500
Then why didn't you make
all this clear from the start?

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.180
I can't accept these charges.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:40.900
Look,

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.660
our prices are all posted.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.020
And besides, letting the deceased rest in
peace is what matters most,

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:46.900
right?

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.220
The deceased is laid to rest,

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.860
and that's why you wait until now

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:50.940
to show me a surprise bill?

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.900
Does that seem reasonable to you?

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.860
Can the deceased truly
rest in peace that way?

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.220
That's not a fair thing to say.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.360
The deceased should come first.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.380
Don't you think?

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:01.840
Yes, the deceased should come first.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.060
But don't try to guilt-trip us.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.120
Does being the grieving family mean
we should just throw money at you?

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.380
Where's the price list?

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.380
Is it even posted in your lobby?
Show it to me.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.900
Enough. It's not that much money.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.660
I'll pay.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.380
Hang on, Meiqi,

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.500
this isn't about the amount.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.180
Isn't this arguing just about the money?

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.440
Is this really the occasion for that?

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.380
Can't you consider the bigger picture?

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.100
There is no

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.900
bigger picture for this family anymore.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.620
Do you have a receipt
and an itemized bill?

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.220
Yes.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.860
If you're overcharging,

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.380
I will be back.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.500
Alright.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:37.740
Then...

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.020
(Party A, Shen Mingzhu)

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.380
Alright.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.700
Thank you.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.620
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.120
I've always been the one in
charge of campus recruitment.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:12.980
Yes.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.460
I'm fairly experienced in that area.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.340
Thank you.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.780
Oh, you flatter me.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.820
Okay, okay.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.940
Thanks, boss.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:29.620
Okay, bye.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:36.900
Director Zhao

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.540
just called to encourage me.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.340
I feel like I've really
got a shot this time.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.340
You know, Mingzhu's father-in-law

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.620
really did have some good connections.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.620
We should treat him to a meal.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.720
You treat him if you want to.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.020
I'm not.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:58.940
Why are you so stingy?

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.540
This is important business.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.580
We owe it to him.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.740
He's gone.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.820
Gone where?

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.820
Went on a trip? Well, he'll come back.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:08.820
He's not coming back.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.880
What, he went abroad?

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.620
He passed away.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.580
A heart attack.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.020
(In loving memory)

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.700
Meiqi,

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.700
you haven't eaten properly for days.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.100
Have some soup, okay?

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.180
Your body won't hold up otherwise.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.540
Meiqi,

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.540
many elders have come.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.020
Let's go offer them a toast

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.180
to show our appreciation.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.060
No.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.180
I can't handle this kind of occasion.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.100
Elders,

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.460
on behalf of my family,

00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.940
I thank you all for coming

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.740
to see my father-in-law off.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.540
Let me propose a toast with tea.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.340
Of course.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.140
Thank you.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.100
Mingzhu,

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.260
the departed are gone.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.440
The living must look forward.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.980
You must stay strong.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.340
I got it. Thank you.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.660
Meiqi,

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.460
your sister-in-law is pregnant.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.620
It's not easy for her,
carrying a baby like that.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.140
Your family will depend
on you from now on.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.540
You need to step up when the time comes,

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.340
you know?

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:40.700
Hello.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.780
(Hello.)

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.380
(Congratulations, Miss Feng.)

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.900
(You've been hired.)

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.160
(May I know when you can come)

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.740
(to complete the onboarding procedures?)

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.260
(Hello?)

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.260
(Miss Feng?)

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.540
I'm sorry.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.950
I'm afraid I won't be able
to accept the position.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.780
I'm sorry to trouble you again.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.940
Well, Dad, I'll leave you be.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.980
I'm going back.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:16.900
Please wait.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:19.700
Inside this safe are

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.060
the company's corporate seal,

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.260
the financial seal,

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.300
and all the accounts and records.

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.940
The password is Jianqi's birthday.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.620
If one day...

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.780
I mean just in case...

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.860
Just in case something happens to me,

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.140
you won't be left scrambling.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.300
I'll leave its key

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.180
right here.
