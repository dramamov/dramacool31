00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.720
Everyone, please take your seats.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.920
Teacher Jiang will be here soon.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.640
Ren Nan, take a look.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.840
Does it look like an adult's signature?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.120
Not at all.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.680
Hui Ge, can you sign my dad's name?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.880
I didn't do well on this test either.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.800
Let me be alone for a moment.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.680
148

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.360
This is a multiple-choice question.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.880
Last chance.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.320
Tang Song, what are you doing?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.600
New shoes?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.720
How about these Air Force Ones?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.600
I have a pair of Jordan 5s, bought too big.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.920
I'll sell them to you for half price.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.000
Sure.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.040
School rules say no selling on campus.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.200
And you, Tang Song.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.280
Your dad's a cop.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.520
Why are you doing business here?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.200
So what?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.320
I'm not going to be a cop when I grow up.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.400
Exactly.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.480
Wait till Teacher Jiang comes and deals with you.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.080
Who are you trying to scare? It's PE class.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.600
He's really here.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.720
Wake up.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.400
I'm dreaming.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.480
The deceased was our high school classmate.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.960
The one you've never forgotten.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.080
I can't even dream of you.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.720
Yu Xingchen.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.360
If you like standing so much,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360
then keep standing.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.720
Today,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.760
the PE teacher is out sick.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.320
I'll be teaching this class instead.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.400
Taking over PE again.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.200
What are you doing?

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.000
The First Mock Exam results are out.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.120
Our class, out of all thirteen classes,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.360
has the worst grades.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.200
You're the worst senior class I've ever taught.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.120
I really missed hearing that.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.640
Take out your test papers.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.200
Question two.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.000
It's a freebie.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.000
You don't even want free points.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.920
What are you doing?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.960
This dream feels so real.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.120
Are you looking for trouble?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.040
Zhang Jie.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.320
You explained it well down there.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.640
Why not come up and explain?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.240
Teacher Jiang.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.440
Yu Xingchen poked me first.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.560
Yu Xingchen.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.880
Always joking around.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.240
How many points did you get?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.400
Just poking at the girls.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.400
Come on, poke me and see what happens.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.960
Quiet.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.560
Yu Xingchen.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.680
Reporting.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.640
Sorry, I was held up by something.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.280
Did I tell you to go back to your seat?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.280
Fine, hand in your homework.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.280
Then go back to your seat.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.160
Sorry.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.040
I didn't do it.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.160
Su Ruo didn't do it either.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.000
Why not?

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.080
I was held up by something.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.040
What was it?

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.080
You're wasting everyone's precious senior year.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.400
People get sick sometimes.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.960
She must have her reasons too.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.960
Why not just start the lesson?

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.280
You're wasting time by dragging this out.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.480
Yu Xingchen.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.000
You're out of control.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.720
I'll go to your house and talk to your parents today.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.960
Don't make up any stories.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.200
Like saying they're away on business.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.400
I won't make anything up.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.160
My mom's laid off, she's home all day.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.840
But that's not true for you, Teacher Jiang.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.560
You said the PE teacher took leave.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.000
How many times has it been now?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.440
How could that be true?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.840
Always on leave.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.480
Yeah.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.760
Quiet.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.440
Yu Xingchen, fine.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.640
This time, the teacher

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.960
won't play games with you.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.280
Let's do something real.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.080
A self-criticism report, one thousand words.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.240
Write it right now.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.440
Don't go home until it's done.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.120
Su Ruo, finish your homework.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.320
Don't go home until it's finished.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.640
Her silhouette is the one I know best.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.400
I've watched this silhouette for three years.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.920
Sometimes, even after school ends,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.120
I still stay behind on purpose.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.040
Wait for her and walk home together.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.640
Just like now, watching her from behind.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.280
But she's already gone.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.120
Even this familiar silhouette

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.800
only appears in my dreams.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.600
Is something on your mind?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.120
Do you need something?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.880
I want to tell you,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.880
Teacher Jiang is actually a good person.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.560
He likes you too.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.280
He wasn't mad at you in class today.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.320
So it's okay if you don't finish.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.240
Mm.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.520
Turns out, even in dreams,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.880
you still ignore me.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.640
I wonder, in your world,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.280
do you ever dream?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.040
Yu Xingchen, let's go home together.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.360
Hurry up, let's go.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.600
Su Ruo was acting strange today.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.000
She ignored everyone.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.160
She wasn't like this before.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.320
Why am I still dreaming?

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.960
Since Mom passed away,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.040
I haven't dreamed of her for five years.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.200
Why are you back so late?

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.360
Where did you go?

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.600
You didn't even change your shoes.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.080
I just remembered,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.080
I've never cooked a meal for Mom.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.600
Is it good?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.040
It's pretty good.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.800
Yu Xingchen.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.120
You're a senior now.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.800
Make sure to work hard, okay?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.360
I'll be fine on the college entrance exam.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.160
I got into Physics at East City University.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.920
Why physics?

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.280
I mean,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.480
I'll definitely get into East City University.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.720
Mom.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.960
At your age, you should get regular gastroscopies.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.760
Why are you worrying about me now?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.040
Waiting for you to get into a good college.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.200
Next National Day, our family of three
will go on a trip.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.440
I've heard you say that
so many times before.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.880
Always "next year,"
again and again.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.880
Stop saying "next year."

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.400
How about this year instead?

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.840
This year's National Day
is already over.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.160
Are you out of your mind?

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.080
Even if it wasn't over,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.520
you still wouldn't take me.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880
What did you just say?

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.640
This year's National Day
is over.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.840
It's been two days
since it ended.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.200
Isn't today your second day
back at school?

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.720
Su Ruo is really pitiful.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.000
I remember her parents
were...

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.360
They passed away
in our senior year.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.800
It was a car accident,
wasn't it?

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.840
I think it happened
around National Day.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.440
She kept it from everyone,
never told a soul.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.240
By the time we found out,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.880
several months
had already passed.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.200
Su Ruo rarely ever
takes time off.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.400
But that National Day,
she took several days off.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.040
She had something
holding her up.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.760
Turns out Su Ruo's parents
had an accident.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.000
It happened
just yesterday.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.400
Su Ruo must feel
so helpless now.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.680
This seventeen-year-old girl

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.680
faces it all
with such stubbornness.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.240
She says nothing
when Teacher Jiang questions her.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.960
Yu Xingchen.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.200
Where are you going
instead of doing homework at night?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.240
Why does Teacher Jiang
always steal the show in my dreams?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.520
Darn it, will you ever stop?

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.200
Teacher Jiang, I have something to do.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.320
I'm about to go to your house
to meet your parents.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.920
Come on, take me
to your house.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.600
Teacher Jiang.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.200
Yu Xingchen, try pushing me again.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.760
Stop messing around
with your teacher.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.920
Why does this dream
never end?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.080
What are you mumbling about?

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.600
Teacher Jiang.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.680
Let me tell you the truth.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.600
Su Ruo's parents
have passed away.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.640
What?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.840
Su Ruo's parents died
in a car accident.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.200
So I need to go
and take her home now.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.600
Yu Xingchen.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.200
You can't joke
about things like this.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.080
If you're making this up,

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.080
just wait and see
how I deal with you.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.280
Teacher Jiang.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.400
Think about it.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.640
She was late
to class again today.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.000
She didn't finish
her test paper.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.840
Was she ever
this out of character before?

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:45.960
Uh...

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.040
When did this happen?

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.240
Just yesterday.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.560
Goodbye, Teacher Jiang.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.440
Stop right there.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.640
It's going to rain.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.880
Take this.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:10:59.960
Thank you.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:01.960
Su Ruo.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.360
Let me walk you home.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.920
No need.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.440
Can you please
stop following me?

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.320
Let me take you home first.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.680
I said no need.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.120
Given your situation now,

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.480
you should really
take care of yourself.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.920
You're on your own now.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.480
If you catch a cold,

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560
who will look after you?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.400
How did you know?

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.000
It's not important.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.720
What's important now

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.240
is that I get you home first.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.760
Okay?
