00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.850
You didn't even know
your shoelaces were untied.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.750
Hold on.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.850
There, it won't come undone now.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.050
Well done!

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:50.670
Thank you.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.000
Have you eaten?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.260
What do you want to eat?

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.950
What should we eat?

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:55.820
Spicy pork stir-fry?

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.600
Spicy pork? How about pasta?

00:21:58.570 --> 00:21:59.620
Why pasta?

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.120
How about pork cutlet?

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.350
Pork cutlet?

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.500
Yes, I have.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.720
If I had known,
I wouldn't have started this.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.070
Liking someone

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.150
means not wanting to hurt them.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.350
I don't know what's going on,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.470
but you should take the initiative
this time.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.700
Give in for once.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.650
Gyeon is always the one
giving in, after all.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.050
Did I give you a hard time?

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.200
I just felt stifled.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.650
Everything will be fine.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.050
Because, Doha, you shine.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.800
I had fun today,

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.570
but thanks to someone, it was ruined.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.630
Why did you do that?

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.550
I told you not to mess with people

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.820
if you don't like them.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.470
Do whatever you want.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.420
I can't act like nothing happened.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.020
I like you.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.070
I said, "I like you."
