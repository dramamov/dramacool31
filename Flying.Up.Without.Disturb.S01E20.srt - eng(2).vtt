00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:46.249
Wait here.

00:01:46.488 --> 00:01:46.928
Yes.

00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:50.488
The Jiusu now

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.809
is different from before.

00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:53.249
It's critical.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:54.768
I understand.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.329
Fortunately we only need

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:57.449
the Dragonblood Herb now

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:58.529
to have all ingredients

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:00.488
and restore your spiritual core.

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:01.729
Be extremely careful.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.249
I'll wait here for your return.

00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:08.968
By the way,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.289
I almost forgot this.

00:02:12.928 --> 00:02:14.849
This boosts spiritual energy.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:15.449
This one

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.409
heals external wounds.

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.129
And this.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.129
It's very effective.

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.449
Take all of them.

00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:24.648
These should suffice.

00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:26.688
Don't worry about me.

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:28.329
I'll be back soon.

00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:32.968
Ling Hui.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:33.729
Ling Hui.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.088
What's wrong, Tan Feng?

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:36.329
It's Kong Hou's message.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:37.208
She's safely

00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:38.329
exited the secret realm.

00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:38.968
Really?

00:02:39.088 --> 00:02:39.808
Excellent.

00:02:41.768 --> 00:02:42.488
What's the matter?

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.208
That Chi Si was actually Jiusu.

00:02:44.368 --> 00:02:45.368
He infiltrated the group.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.208
Huan Zong is leading a pursuit now.

00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:50.808
Thankfully Kong Hou is safe.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:52.648
Kong Hou is safe.

00:02:52.648 --> 00:02:54.169
Shouldn't you be happy?

00:02:54.648 --> 00:02:55.449
Kong Hou's safe.

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:56.569
Of course I'm relieved.

00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:57.569
I nearly cried

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.808
getting the message earlier.

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:00.129
But did you forget?

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.729
When Master ordered me

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:02.609
to bring her back,

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.729
I pretended not to hear.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:04.648
If he finds out now

00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:05.688
she met Jiusu,

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:08.088
I'll be... I'll be...

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.768
True.

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.368
With his temper,

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.849
you're in deep trouble.

00:03:15.088 --> 00:03:16.049
Alright.

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.488
Just beg for his mercy.

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:18.569
Perhaps he'll

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.569
forgive you.

00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:21.768
No other choice then.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:22.768
Also,

00:03:23.088 --> 00:03:23.688
Kong Hou wants

00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:24.889
to meet us at the tea stall.

00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:25.729
Let's hurry.

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:26.088
Okay.

00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:35.329
Our lord effortlessly

00:03:35.368 --> 00:03:36.729
deceived all the orthodox sects.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:37.889
Those fools

00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:38.609
never realized

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.208
his true identity.

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.889
I also heard

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.129
our lord killed

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.648
everyone in the secret realm,
humiliating the righteous sects.

00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:56.889
My lord!

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.889
My lord, bad news.

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.129
Intruders are attacking.

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.248
They tracked me down already?

00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:07.049
My lord,

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:08.049
do we fight?

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:10.409
Not yet.

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.289
We can't afford to waste our strength.

00:04:25.688 --> 00:04:26.289
Fear not.

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.849
We're here to save you.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:38.488
They're nearby. Search!

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:39.209
Understood.

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:39.888
Let's go.

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:51.808
Master,

00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:53.008
no one's here.

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:54.769
There's writing here.

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:59.409
(My father's murderers shall die.)

00:04:59.688 --> 00:05:00.769
(I will slaughter)

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:02.368
(all you shameless rats)

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.488
(to honor my father Rong Ji's spirit.)

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:15.089
Kong Hou.

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:16.488
- Kong Hou.
- Kong Hou!

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:17.209
Tan Feng.

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:18.169
Kong Hou.

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.128
I'm so relieved

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:23.128
to see you safe.

00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:26.248
I'm fine, Tan Feng. Truly.

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:26.769
Moreover,

00:05:26.808 --> 00:05:28.089
we've finally met, haven't we?

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.969
You've been long gone.

00:05:29.008 --> 00:05:30.409
I was worried sick.

00:05:30.568 --> 00:05:31.328
And Tan Feng said

00:05:31.328 --> 00:05:32.688
you encountered Jiusu.

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.248
You nearly scared me to death.

00:05:34.248 --> 00:05:35.368
There were some dangers,

00:05:35.448 --> 00:05:36.609
but all turned out well.

00:05:36.688 --> 00:05:38.008
See? I'm perfectly fine now.

00:05:43.368 --> 00:05:44.248
Tan Feng,

00:05:44.808 --> 00:05:46.409
Kong Hou is getting hungry.

00:05:46.448 --> 00:05:46.928
Could you

00:05:46.928 --> 00:05:48.409
buy us some pastries?

00:05:48.568 --> 00:05:49.328
No.

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:50.808
I need to watch Kong Hou.

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.328
Stop crying now.

00:05:52.328 --> 00:05:53.049
Look at me,

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.049
alive and well.

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:55.969
As Ling Hui said,

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:57.688
I really am getting hungry.

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.008
Could you buy me some pastries?

00:05:59.008 --> 00:05:59.688
Please?

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.609
Okay.

00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:01.409
Wait for me.

00:06:01.568 --> 00:06:02.568
Go quickly.

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:06.209
Sit down.

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:09.248
Kong Hou,

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:10.328
your trip to the realm

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:11.409
sounded terrifying.

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:12.209
Hearing about it

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:13.328
made my hair stand on end.

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:14.209
But fortunately,

00:06:14.488 --> 00:06:15.169
we got two herbs

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:16.368
Huan Zong needed.

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:18.008
However...

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.769
Ladies,

00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:20.008
want some qiaoguo?

00:06:21.008 --> 00:06:22.008
Let's buy some qiaoguo.

00:06:22.008 --> 00:06:22.688
My treat.

00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:24.609
This time, I'm paying.

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:26.209
I have spirit stones now.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:27.609
How many?

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:28.328
Four.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.209
Four qiaoguo.

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:31.209
Here you are.

00:06:31.368 --> 00:06:31.808
Thank you.

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:32.688
Thank you.

00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:35.529
Tasty qiaoguo!

00:06:35.568 --> 00:06:36.328
Four?

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:37.849
One for you, one for me,

00:06:37.928 --> 00:06:38.888
and one for Tan Feng.

00:06:38.928 --> 00:06:39.609
And the fourth?

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:40.368
Are you having two?

00:06:40.688 --> 00:06:42.328
The last one's for Huan Zong.

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:43.969
Why give him any?

00:06:44.248 --> 00:06:45.409
The Luanfeng Peak people

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:46.729
are pursuing Jiusu.

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.969
Besides, he's supposed to be fasting.

00:06:49.128 --> 00:06:50.089
Huan Zong

00:06:50.128 --> 00:06:51.928
occasionally eats a bite or two.

00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:54.928
And this is from me to him.

00:06:56.008 --> 00:06:57.568
Are you two...

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:58.849
No.

00:06:59.049 --> 00:07:00.409
What I meant is,

00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:03.888
what are your plans now?

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:07.769
I haven't decided yet.

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:09.409
I just want

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:12.368
to stay with Huan Zong forever.

00:07:12.568 --> 00:07:15.568
So you've pledged your hearts
to each other.

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:17.729
What 'pledged hearts'?

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:18.328
Ling Hui,

00:07:18.328 --> 00:07:20.049
you're being too blunt.

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:21.568
You're making me shy.

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:23.568
What's there to be shy about?

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:24.169
Unless

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:25.368
you don't want him.

00:07:25.609 --> 00:07:26.769
Of course I do.

00:07:26.928 --> 00:07:28.328
I definitely want to be with him.

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:30.248
It's just

00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:32.769
I don't know how to

00:07:32.888 --> 00:07:34.928
be with him forever

00:07:35.008 --> 00:07:35.688
and never part.

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:36.609
That's simple.

00:07:36.609 --> 00:07:37.568
Get married.

00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:40.328
Getting married?

00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:45.089
But he hasn't mentioned

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.128
marriage to me.

00:07:46.488 --> 00:07:47.248
Kong Hou,

00:07:47.248 --> 00:07:48.609
since when are you so rigid?

00:07:48.808 --> 00:07:50.849
The man doesn't have to propose.

00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:51.969
A woman can do it too.

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:54.488
True.

00:07:58.568 --> 00:07:58.928
Right.

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:02.248
I'll marry Huan Zong.

00:08:05.688 --> 00:08:06.568
Where are you going?

00:08:06.808 --> 00:08:07.888
To ask for his hand.

00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:09.529
The storybooks say

00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:10.849
marriages

00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:12.769
need proper ceremony.

00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:14.928
And it's a once-in-a-lifetime event.

00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:16.409
I must prepare thoroughly.

00:08:16.609 --> 00:08:18.128
When Huan Zong returns,

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:19.289
I'll tell him

00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:21.368
I want to marry him.

00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:22.649
Kong Hou,

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:23.969
there's no need to rush this.

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:26.609
It requires proper planning.

00:08:27.248 --> 00:08:28.529
Proper planning?

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:32.808
Senior Ling Bo.

00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:37.649
Ling Bo,

00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:38.848
everyone's ready.

00:08:38.848 --> 00:08:39.769
We can depart.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:42.369
Ling Bo,

00:08:42.608 --> 00:08:43.129
why do you

00:08:43.129 --> 00:08:44.328
seem preoccupied?

00:08:45.808 --> 00:08:46.808
Do you know

00:08:46.808 --> 00:08:48.129
what foxes like to eat?

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:50.289
Foxes?

00:08:50.568 --> 00:08:51.249
Ling Bo,

00:08:51.409 --> 00:08:51.889
why are you

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:53.009
suddenly asking about foxes?

00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:54.529
Will you keep a spirit pet?

00:08:54.688 --> 00:08:55.769
No more questions.

00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:57.688
Anyway, I need this information.

00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:59.448
Speak up if you know.

00:09:00.129 --> 00:09:01.088
Foxes love chickens.

00:09:01.328 --> 00:09:01.968
Right.

00:09:02.769 --> 00:09:04.009
But he's been fasting.

00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:05.369
A fox fasts too?

00:09:05.568 --> 00:09:07.649
How fascinating.

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:11.129
I recall my uncle

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:12.968
once kept a fox spirit pet.

00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:14.409
It adored Ancient Tea Fruits.

00:09:14.568 --> 00:09:16.129
They're great for fox fur maintenance.

00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:18.968
Ancient Tea Fruits improve fur.

00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:19.808
And Lucid Fruits.

00:09:19.808 --> 00:09:20.928
Excellent for eye health.

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:22.169
And Woodsky Grass.

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:23.688
It makes foxes hyperactive.

00:09:23.728 --> 00:09:25.169
They'll roll around excitedly.

00:09:25.249 --> 00:09:27.848
Ancient Tea Fruits, Lucid Fruits,
and Woodsky Grass.

00:09:28.448 --> 00:09:28.928
Enough.

00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:29.889
You go ahead.

00:09:29.889 --> 00:09:30.688
I have things to do.

00:09:30.688 --> 00:09:31.448
Don't wait for me.

00:09:32.608 --> 00:09:34.249
- Ling Bo?
- Ling Bo?

00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:47.208
You're back.

00:09:47.489 --> 00:09:48.608
Are you hurt?

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:49.409
No.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.169
Let's get inside then.

00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:52.568
Alright.

00:09:52.968 --> 00:09:53.928
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:55.208
By the way,

00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:56.649
should you check on Lin Hu?

00:09:56.728 --> 00:09:57.448
Is he alright?

00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:25.649
Ling Bo, you're here.

00:10:26.369 --> 00:10:27.328
How are you?

00:10:29.289 --> 00:10:29.808
Well...

00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:31.728
Should I

00:10:31.728 --> 00:10:32.928
call a healer for you?

00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:33.649
No need.

00:10:34.249 --> 00:10:35.688
Some medicine will help.

00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:45.009
My arms feel weak.

00:10:47.289 --> 00:10:48.769
Could you assist me?

00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:51.129
Don't push your luck.

00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:54.728
Fine, I'll manage.

00:11:01.608 --> 00:11:03.009
Never mind. I'll do it.

00:11:08.088 --> 00:11:08.568
Here.

00:11:18.848 --> 00:11:20.568
Slow down. It's hot.

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:30.968
Here.

00:11:38.249 --> 00:11:38.848
Thank you.

00:11:40.448 --> 00:11:41.369
No need to thank me.

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:42.688
You became like this

00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:43.769
because of me.

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:44.968
I'm here to repay my debt.

00:11:45.608 --> 00:11:46.369
Well,

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:48.169
don't dwell on it.

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:50.289
Though you've lost cultivation now,

00:11:50.448 --> 00:11:52.369
your spiritual core remains intact.

00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:54.808
If you start cultivating anew,

00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:56.208
within a century,

00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:57.448
full recovery is certain.

00:11:58.088 --> 00:11:58.889
Moreover,

00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:01.529
I came to tell you

00:12:01.608 --> 00:12:02.848
I've sent my sect members

00:12:02.848 --> 00:12:03.808
back first.

00:12:05.608 --> 00:12:06.688
I am

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:08.928
staying to care for you.

00:12:09.088 --> 00:12:10.249
R-Really?

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:15.249
Ling Bo,

00:12:15.608 --> 00:12:17.409
this sudden kindness

00:12:17.608 --> 00:12:20.129
is unfamiliar to me.

00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:21.728
You'll get used to it.

00:12:21.728 --> 00:12:22.688
I always

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:23.889
repay what's owed.

00:12:29.568 --> 00:12:31.369
Well then.

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:34.169
Let me share something too.

00:12:34.728 --> 00:12:35.328
It's about

00:12:35.968 --> 00:12:37.129
my tail.

00:12:37.649 --> 00:12:39.409
It's broken,

00:12:39.808 --> 00:12:40.369
but

00:12:40.369 --> 00:12:43.289
it can actually regrow.

00:12:43.289 --> 00:12:44.208
And my cultivation

00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:45.649
will fully recover too.

00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:49.688
What did you say?

00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:51.088
Don't look at me like that.

00:12:53.728 --> 00:12:56.088
Don't draw your sword.

00:12:57.249 --> 00:12:57.889
Wait.

00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:58.889
Don't draw it.

00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:00.009
Regardless of everything,

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:01.088
I've lost my tail.

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:02.448
At the very least,

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:03.568
I'm still a patient,

00:13:03.568 --> 00:13:03.928
right?

00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:05.169
I need... need care.

00:13:05.448 --> 00:13:06.289
Fine.

00:13:06.728 --> 00:13:08.009
Then I'll make sure

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:10.049
to take good care of you.

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:10.769
Wait.

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:11.728
Stop running.

00:13:11.728 --> 00:13:12.249
Ling Bo.

00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:12.688
Stop.

00:13:12.688 --> 00:13:13.009
Listen.

00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.769
Wait, listen to me.

00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:15.169
Stop right there.

00:13:15.409 --> 00:13:17.489
I didn't tell you earlier

00:13:17.489 --> 00:13:18.529
because

00:13:18.568 --> 00:13:19.968
you've been so kind to me.

00:13:19.968 --> 00:13:21.009
I... I just...

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.088
So you lied to me.

00:13:22.088 --> 00:13:22.409
And now

00:13:22.409 --> 00:13:23.649
you're blaming me?

00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:25.208
I'm not blaming you.

00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:27.529
Before I lost my tail,
you'd scold and hit me.

00:13:27.608 --> 00:13:28.688
But after I lost it,

00:13:28.769 --> 00:13:30.249
you stopped both.

00:13:30.249 --> 00:13:31.448
Now you even feed me medicine.

00:13:31.489 --> 00:13:33.009
I was not used to

00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:34.049
your sudden kindness.

00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:35.088
So I went along with it.

00:13:35.088 --> 00:13:35.608
Alright.

00:13:35.688 --> 00:13:37.928
So you kept lying to me?

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:39.608
After all I've done for you.

00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:40.728
You made me feel guilty.

00:13:40.728 --> 00:13:41.649
That's not true.

00:13:41.649 --> 00:13:42.688
It wasn't like that.

00:13:42.728 --> 00:13:43.448
I told you

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:43.968
as soon

00:13:43.968 --> 00:13:44.968
as I felt better.

00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:46.448
I worried you'd blame yourself.

00:13:46.489 --> 00:13:47.568
So I told you right away

00:13:47.568 --> 00:13:49.129
about the regrowth possibility.

00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:50.009
I wanted

00:13:50.169 --> 00:13:51.568
to spare you from worry.

00:13:54.009 --> 00:13:54.848
We're even now.

00:13:55.328 --> 00:13:56.328
Take care of yourself.

00:13:56.448 --> 00:13:57.289
I'm returning now.

00:13:57.728 --> 00:13:58.208
Wait.

00:13:59.009 --> 00:13:59.889
I... I...

00:14:00.169 --> 00:14:01.409
Look at me.

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:03.448
You're leaving now?

00:14:03.568 --> 00:14:05.289
I haven't finished my medicine.

00:14:08.489 --> 00:14:09.688
He still got away.

00:14:10.088 --> 00:14:11.448
But I'll catch him.

00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:14.009
Huan Zong.

00:14:15.448 --> 00:14:16.289
In the past,

00:14:16.409 --> 00:14:18.129
when I heard cultivators
from Luanfeng Peak

00:14:18.328 --> 00:14:19.928
captured dark cultivators

00:14:20.088 --> 00:14:21.328
or subdued demons,

00:14:21.448 --> 00:14:22.448
I always thought

00:14:22.448 --> 00:14:23.369
it was just their duty.

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:25.129
It felt so distant from me.

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:26.009
But

00:14:26.009 --> 00:14:27.369
since knowing you,

00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:28.529
I've realized

00:14:28.728 --> 00:14:30.049
that you all devote

00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:31.369
so much effort

00:14:31.489 --> 00:14:32.208
and you face

00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:33.249
unimaginable dangers.

00:14:33.448 --> 00:14:35.448
From another perspective,

00:14:35.568 --> 00:14:37.049
cultivators of Luanfeng Peak

00:14:37.049 --> 00:14:38.049
are like everyone else.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.529
You're ordinary people

00:14:39.568 --> 00:14:40.928
who cultivate as we do.

00:14:41.009 --> 00:14:41.769
You've actually

00:14:41.928 --> 00:14:43.529
done exceptionally well.

00:14:43.728 --> 00:14:45.129
Stop being so hard on yourself.

00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:45.728
Okay?

00:14:50.409 --> 00:14:51.169
Right, Huan Zong,

00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:52.169
earlier,

00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:53.649
while waiting for you,

00:14:53.848 --> 00:14:54.688
I read

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:56.688
the most fascinating storybook.

00:14:56.889 --> 00:14:58.328
It tells about

00:14:58.489 --> 00:14:59.289
a man

00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:00.208
who deceives

00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:01.489
a woman so cruelly.

00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:02.728
That poor woman

00:15:02.728 --> 00:15:04.289
is so tragic.

00:15:07.568 --> 00:15:08.249
Is that so?

00:15:08.928 --> 00:15:10.889
What does he lie to her about?

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:12.249
The woman

00:15:12.249 --> 00:15:13.769
only learns from others' words

00:15:13.769 --> 00:15:15.088
upon her deathbed

00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:16.889
about the man's true identity.

00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:18.129
Well,

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:19.889
isn't that man utterly despicable?

00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:21.608
Keeping her in the dark.

00:15:23.568 --> 00:15:24.328
Then

00:15:25.489 --> 00:15:27.328
is the woman angry?

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:30.009
Of course.

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:31.448
She becomes furious.

00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:32.568
I suspect

00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:34.369
that's actually what kills her.

00:15:35.328 --> 00:15:36.889
But what if the man

00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:38.369
has unspeakable hardships?

00:15:38.369 --> 00:15:38.928
Right?

00:15:39.049 --> 00:15:40.369
Still unacceptable.

00:15:40.489 --> 00:15:41.169
Even if

00:15:41.169 --> 00:15:43.289
he faces heaven-defying adversities,

00:15:43.328 --> 00:15:44.688
they can discuss it together.

00:15:44.808 --> 00:15:46.289
How can he deceive her like that

00:15:46.328 --> 00:15:47.688
while hypocritically claiming

00:15:47.688 --> 00:15:50.409
eternal, unyielding love?

00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:52.688
He won't even reveal

00:15:52.688 --> 00:15:53.649
his true identity.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:55.409
That man

00:15:55.529 --> 00:15:56.928
is truly despicable.

00:15:57.129 --> 00:15:58.129
As for the woman,

00:15:58.289 --> 00:15:59.649
I feel she deserves better.

00:15:59.968 --> 00:16:01.328
(We are in love.)

00:16:02.049 --> 00:16:03.169
(I should have told her)

00:16:03.169 --> 00:16:04.169
(about my real identity.)

00:16:05.448 --> 00:16:06.249
(How could I...)

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:09.208
(For something so crucial,)

00:16:09.728 --> 00:16:10.728
(how could he keep it)

00:16:11.608 --> 00:16:12.568
(from her?)

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:15.728
Kong Hou,

00:16:16.249 --> 00:16:16.808
I...

00:16:17.249 --> 00:16:18.009
By the way,

00:16:18.608 --> 00:16:20.009
earlier I heard people

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:21.249
address you

00:16:22.289 --> 00:16:25.409
as 'Master' or something.

00:16:26.088 --> 00:16:27.249
Don't tell me,

00:16:27.249 --> 00:16:28.088
like the man

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:29.649
in the storybook,

00:16:29.848 --> 00:16:31.489
you're actually not Huan Zong

00:16:31.769 --> 00:16:33.088
and have been lying to me?

00:16:33.289 --> 00:16:34.409
Then I'd be more pitiful

00:16:34.409 --> 00:16:35.448
than that woman.

00:16:38.688 --> 00:16:39.369
Kong Hou,

00:16:40.688 --> 00:16:41.889
at this point,

00:16:42.848 --> 00:16:44.129
I won't keep it from you.

00:16:45.369 --> 00:16:46.529
I am Zhong Xi.

00:16:47.728 --> 00:16:48.769
Zhong Xi?

00:16:49.088 --> 00:16:50.369
You Zhong Xi?

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.328
Master of Liuguang Sect's Luanfeng Peak,

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:54.968
Master Zhong Xi?

00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:56.448
Heavens!

00:16:56.928 --> 00:16:58.369
My wild guess was right.

00:17:05.648 --> 00:17:06.689
But...

00:17:06.969 --> 00:17:07.568
What is it?

00:17:15.249 --> 00:17:18.128
So you're Zhong Xi.

00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:21.408
Then you must carry

00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:22.489
tremendous burdens.

00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:24.568
No wonder you were so harsh

00:17:24.848 --> 00:17:26.368
on yourself before.

00:17:29.769 --> 00:17:30.929
Then the descriptions

00:17:30.929 --> 00:17:32.168
I read in storybooks

00:17:32.608 --> 00:17:33.848
about Master Zhong Xi

00:17:33.929 --> 00:17:35.808
suffering near-fatal injuries,

00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:37.848
brushing with death...

00:17:38.168 --> 00:17:39.128
Were they true?

00:17:40.128 --> 00:17:41.408
I used to think

00:17:41.729 --> 00:17:43.088
those were just

00:17:43.088 --> 00:17:44.408
exaggerated fictional tales.

00:17:44.769 --> 00:17:45.729
After all, stories need

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:47.568
perilous twists

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:49.568
and heart-wrenching separations

00:17:49.729 --> 00:17:52.128
to be romantic and engaging.

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:53.088
But

00:17:53.848 --> 00:17:55.209
now I realize

00:17:55.848 --> 00:17:57.128
those were events

00:17:57.128 --> 00:17:58.408
that truly happened to you.

00:18:00.168 --> 00:18:02.769
You've endured so much.

00:18:03.608 --> 00:18:06.408
My heart aches for you.

00:18:06.848 --> 00:18:08.009
I worry about you.

00:18:12.088 --> 00:18:12.769
It's alright.

00:18:13.648 --> 00:18:15.328
I've grown accustomed over the years.

00:18:16.168 --> 00:18:17.049
Moreover,

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.408
those storybooks

00:18:19.249 --> 00:18:20.489
are mostly exaggerated.

00:18:22.408 --> 00:18:23.328
About the part

00:18:23.449 --> 00:18:24.328
saying

00:18:24.328 --> 00:18:25.848
that since taking over Luanfeng Peak,

00:18:25.848 --> 00:18:26.888
you've lost all emotions,

00:18:26.969 --> 00:18:27.969
is that also exaggerated?

00:18:28.568 --> 00:18:30.969
I simply hold myself and others
to high standards.

00:18:31.769 --> 00:18:32.888
Taking over Luanfeng Peak

00:18:33.249 --> 00:18:33.608
happened

00:18:33.608 --> 00:18:34.769
over a century ago.

00:18:36.848 --> 00:18:37.648
Before,

00:18:38.289 --> 00:18:39.289
I couldn't understand

00:18:39.608 --> 00:18:41.608
why certain people

00:18:41.648 --> 00:18:43.328
would see themselves as swords.

00:18:43.529 --> 00:18:44.769
Cold and emotionless,

00:18:45.489 --> 00:18:47.128
even when gravely wounded,

00:18:47.529 --> 00:18:48.848
they disregard their own lives

00:18:48.848 --> 00:18:49.969
but fight desperately.

00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:53.128
I solemnly swear

00:18:53.489 --> 00:18:55.729
to govern Luanfeng Peak
from this day forward

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:58.168
to eradicate evil
and uphold righteousness,

00:18:58.408 --> 00:18:59.729
leaving no wickedness unpunished.

00:19:00.449 --> 00:19:01.969
I'll stand with the peak's disciples

00:19:02.088 --> 00:19:04.128
through life, death, and every trial.

00:19:04.729 --> 00:19:07.368
As Luanfeng Peak's master,

00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:09.689
I cannot afford ordinary emotions.

00:19:10.689 --> 00:19:12.608
Master Song He once told me

00:19:13.009 --> 00:19:14.249
that in my master's youth,

00:19:14.729 --> 00:19:15.888
his compassion

00:19:16.449 --> 00:19:17.689
caused peers to be injured.

00:19:18.808 --> 00:19:19.568
Even worse,

00:19:20.209 --> 00:19:21.529
a dear friend of his

00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:22.489
perished because of it.

00:19:23.088 --> 00:19:24.088
So your master simply

00:19:24.088 --> 00:19:25.888
wants to spare you
from repeating his mistakes

00:19:26.049 --> 00:19:27.209
and losing loved ones.

00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:28.608
Right?

00:19:29.729 --> 00:19:30.209
Yes.

00:19:33.808 --> 00:19:35.009
Enough explanations.

00:19:35.368 --> 00:19:36.088
I'm glad

00:19:37.449 --> 00:19:38.408
you're not upset.

00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:41.328
How could I possibly be upset?

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:42.209
Moreover,

00:19:42.608 --> 00:19:43.848
I've made my decision.

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.249
From now on,

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:47.368
whatever happens to you,

00:19:47.648 --> 00:19:48.888
I'll stand by your side

00:19:48.929 --> 00:19:50.049
to share your burdens.

00:19:50.249 --> 00:19:52.568
I'll protect you without fail.

00:20:12.088 --> 00:20:12.608
Ling Bo.

00:20:16.608 --> 00:20:17.408
I just heard

00:20:17.608 --> 00:20:19.368
Zhaohan Sect's members departed.

00:20:20.088 --> 00:20:21.368
I feared I'd missed you.

00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:24.209
Blame your Liuguang Sect's

00:20:24.209 --> 00:20:25.368
stinking fox.

00:20:25.529 --> 00:20:26.808
His antics were so outrageous.

00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:28.088
He even lost his tail.

00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:29.088
I merely stayed

00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:30.168
to clean up

00:20:30.328 --> 00:20:31.449
his mess.

00:20:31.888 --> 00:20:33.009
You mean Lin Hu?

00:20:33.729 --> 00:20:35.249
He is quite nice.

00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:37.689
He's just impulsive sometimes,

00:20:38.088 --> 00:20:39.049
with fewer formalities.

00:20:39.249 --> 00:20:40.529
You'll appreciate him in time.

00:20:40.529 --> 00:20:42.049
Who'd want that?

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:43.808
I

00:20:43.808 --> 00:20:45.168
don't mingle

00:20:45.168 --> 00:20:46.449
with just anyone.

00:20:47.848 --> 00:20:48.689
Enough about him.

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:49.769
By the way,

00:20:50.049 --> 00:20:51.648
I heard about your secret realm trip.

00:20:51.929 --> 00:20:52.489
Are you

00:20:52.608 --> 00:20:53.808
experiencing any ill effects?

00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.729
None at all.

00:20:56.209 --> 00:20:56.729
Good.

00:20:57.408 --> 00:20:58.009
I'll be

00:20:58.088 --> 00:20:59.368
returning to Zhaohan Sect soon.

00:21:00.608 --> 00:21:01.449
Wait.

00:21:02.529 --> 00:21:03.328
The day

00:21:04.128 --> 00:21:05.608
grows late,

00:21:05.969 --> 00:21:07.249
and rainy clouds gather.

00:21:07.729 --> 00:21:08.529
Rain may affect

00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:09.128
your journey.

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.808
Why not

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:10.769
stay here

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:11.529
one more night?

00:21:16.209 --> 00:21:17.608
(Is the jade pendant)

00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:19.608
(the one I gave him before?)

00:21:21.408 --> 00:21:22.328
Stay one more night.

00:21:22.568 --> 00:21:23.529
It won't hurt.

00:21:27.969 --> 00:21:28.489
Very well.

00:21:28.568 --> 00:21:29.449
I'll depart tomorrow.

00:21:29.848 --> 00:21:30.249
Sure.

00:21:41.929 --> 00:21:42.648
Who's there?

00:21:47.209 --> 00:21:48.449
Liuguang Sect's Xiao Dong.

00:21:49.088 --> 00:21:49.729
Lady,

00:21:50.128 --> 00:21:51.769
are you here for
the Cultivation Assembly?

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:52.408
Yes.

00:21:54.608 --> 00:21:55.449
But

00:21:55.929 --> 00:21:57.449
why were you staring at me?

00:21:58.769 --> 00:21:59.689
Not at you.

00:22:00.328 --> 00:22:01.408
I merely noticed

00:22:02.368 --> 00:22:03.328
(Night Vision Art)
the book you held.

00:22:05.808 --> 00:22:07.009
If it interests you,

00:22:07.128 --> 00:22:08.449
you can have it.

00:22:08.888 --> 00:22:10.249
I've already read it twice.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:13.848
Lady,

00:22:15.368 --> 00:22:16.608
what should I call you?

00:22:17.088 --> 00:22:17.929
And how should I

00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:19.529
return this book to you?

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:20.888
I'm Ling Bo.

00:22:21.128 --> 00:22:23.408
Keep it for now.

00:22:23.489 --> 00:22:24.648
Return it after you finish.

00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:32.689
Ling Bo?

00:22:33.568 --> 00:22:34.168
So she's

00:22:34.168 --> 00:22:35.729
Zhaohan Sect's leader's chief disciple,

00:22:36.568 --> 00:22:37.408
Lady Ling Bo?

00:22:47.088 --> 00:22:47.929
What is

00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:50.009
Xiao Dong's intention anyway?

00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:51.368
Why's he still wearing

00:22:51.368 --> 00:22:53.408
that jade pendant from back then?

00:22:54.568 --> 00:22:56.769
I thought I made myself clear.

00:22:57.009 --> 00:22:57.769
Why?

00:22:59.489 --> 00:23:00.128
Could it be...

00:23:01.969 --> 00:23:02.729
No, no.

00:23:02.969 --> 00:23:03.929
I'm overthinking this.

00:23:05.368 --> 00:23:06.128
Xiao Dong.

00:23:07.489 --> 00:23:08.969
You remember my name?

00:23:09.808 --> 00:23:10.769
Your name

00:23:10.769 --> 00:23:11.969
is pleasant and memorable.

00:23:12.249 --> 00:23:12.648
What?

00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:13.848
Need something from me?

00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:16.249
I came to ask you

00:23:16.368 --> 00:23:17.648
about some passages in the book.

00:23:17.848 --> 00:23:18.568
There are parts

00:23:18.568 --> 00:23:19.449
I don't understand.

00:23:22.969 --> 00:23:24.449
Have you been waiting long?

00:23:24.449 --> 00:23:25.289
Why not call me?

00:23:25.449 --> 00:23:26.289
I just got here.

00:23:26.568 --> 00:23:28.848
I didn't want to bother you

00:23:29.648 --> 00:23:30.608
without proper notice.

00:23:31.529 --> 00:23:32.368
The purpose

00:23:32.368 --> 00:23:33.969
of our attendance at the Assembly

00:23:34.209 --> 00:23:35.529
is for cultivation discussions.

00:23:35.729 --> 00:23:36.489
We can sit down

00:23:36.489 --> 00:23:37.929
and discuss your questions.

00:23:38.289 --> 00:23:39.808
Thank you, Lady Ling Bo.

00:23:44.808 --> 00:23:45.368
Ling Bo.

00:23:46.769 --> 00:23:47.289
What is it?

00:23:47.648 --> 00:23:48.328
Ling Bo,

00:23:48.568 --> 00:23:50.088
the market's lantern show is in days.

00:23:50.168 --> 00:23:51.529
There's word of pretty lanterns,

00:23:51.568 --> 00:23:53.009
all sorts of toys,

00:23:53.009 --> 00:23:54.328
and even street performances.

00:23:54.328 --> 00:23:55.449
Let's go see it.

00:23:57.088 --> 00:23:58.449
Xiao Dong asked me out.

00:23:58.489 --> 00:23:59.449
He has a few questions

00:23:59.449 --> 00:24:00.408
to ask me,

00:24:00.408 --> 00:24:01.848
and we'll visit the lantern show.

00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:03.249
Xiao Dong?

00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:04.568
Why have you been with Xiao Dong

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:06.489
from Liuguang Sect so often?

00:24:06.568 --> 00:24:07.489
Because Liuguang Sect

00:24:07.489 --> 00:24:08.608
is hosting the Assembly.

00:24:08.769 --> 00:24:09.729
Certainly,

00:24:09.729 --> 00:24:11.088
they'll be hospitable to guests

00:24:11.088 --> 00:24:11.729
like us.

00:24:11.769 --> 00:24:13.088
Besides, Xiao Dong

00:24:13.088 --> 00:24:14.209
has great character.

00:24:14.408 --> 00:24:15.249
He's driven,

00:24:15.249 --> 00:24:16.529
and we get along well.

00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:17.808
Didn't he give you

00:24:17.808 --> 00:24:19.168
a Frostbell Flower yesterday?

00:24:19.408 --> 00:24:21.049
That plant only grows on cliffsides.

00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:22.608
It must've been hard to get one.

00:24:23.289 --> 00:24:25.929
He said he was gathering energy

00:24:26.009 --> 00:24:26.608
and happened

00:24:26.608 --> 00:24:28.249
to see such a beautiful bloom there.

00:24:28.328 --> 00:24:30.009
So he picked it for me.

00:24:30.128 --> 00:24:31.289
Every time you practiced

00:24:31.328 --> 00:24:32.049
recently,

00:24:32.049 --> 00:24:34.168
he brought you cooling tea.

00:24:35.128 --> 00:24:36.368
That's Liuguang Sect's

00:24:36.368 --> 00:24:37.368
special brew.

00:24:37.368 --> 00:24:39.088
It's said to aid cultivation.

00:24:39.128 --> 00:24:40.289
The way he looks at you

00:24:40.368 --> 00:24:42.249
is full of admiration.

00:24:42.929 --> 00:24:44.289
Stop talking nonsense.

00:24:44.489 --> 00:24:45.729
I'm not.

00:24:45.929 --> 00:24:47.249
And I think you two

00:24:47.328 --> 00:24:48.289
look great together,

00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:49.209
a perfect match.

00:24:49.408 --> 00:24:51.689
You are Lady Ling Bo

00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:53.209
with radiant beauty.

00:24:53.368 --> 00:24:54.168
As for him,

00:24:54.209 --> 00:24:55.689
he's rather dashing

00:24:55.769 --> 00:24:56.848
and charming too.

00:24:57.249 --> 00:24:58.128
And both of you

00:24:58.128 --> 00:24:59.648
have exceptional talent.

00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:01.888
They say Xiao Dong

00:25:01.929 --> 00:25:03.769
is Liuguang Sect's rising star.

00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:04.689
In just a few years,

00:25:04.689 --> 00:25:06.088
he's reached the Golden Core stage.

00:25:06.168 --> 00:25:08.209
His future's boundless.

00:25:08.328 --> 00:25:09.729
What? Golden Core?

00:25:09.888 --> 00:25:10.449
Yes.

00:25:10.808 --> 00:25:12.368
Moreover, I think you should

00:25:12.449 --> 00:25:14.128
elevate your relationship with him.

00:25:14.249 --> 00:25:16.128
It would be a powerful union.

00:25:16.449 --> 00:25:17.808
If he's at the Golden Core stage,

00:25:17.929 --> 00:25:18.769
how could he not know

00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:20.128
the Night Vision Art?

00:25:21.168 --> 00:25:22.529
Why would he lie to me?

00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:30.729
Ling Bo?

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:31.689
Why are you here?

00:25:31.808 --> 00:25:33.088
What's your intention?

00:25:33.128 --> 00:25:34.249
At the Golden Core stage,

00:25:34.249 --> 00:25:34.888
you know all.

00:25:34.888 --> 00:25:35.808
Yet you pretended

00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:36.888
to seek guidance from me.

00:25:37.128 --> 00:25:37.568
Tell me.

00:25:37.808 --> 00:25:39.289
Why did you play me for a fool?

00:25:39.729 --> 00:25:40.529
I didn't.

00:25:40.608 --> 00:25:41.088
Truly.

00:25:41.489 --> 00:25:43.368
Then why did you approach me?

00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:44.209
What's your motive?

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:45.168
Any schemes?

00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:46.529
I harbor no ill intentions.

00:25:46.808 --> 00:25:48.888
Then why did you

00:25:49.128 --> 00:25:50.209
feign ignorance?

00:25:51.328 --> 00:25:52.088
Well...

00:25:53.608 --> 00:25:55.128
What's so unspeakable about it?

00:25:55.128 --> 00:25:56.368
What's your true intention?

00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:00.489
Ling Bo.

00:26:01.128 --> 00:26:01.929
I wish to cultivate,

00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:04.128
advance,

00:26:05.128 --> 00:26:06.368
and build a future with you.

00:26:07.328 --> 00:26:08.529
You make it

00:26:08.529 --> 00:26:09.568
sound so formal.

00:26:09.729 --> 00:26:11.568
We're cultivators of the Lingyou Realm,

00:26:11.888 --> 00:26:12.848
essentially one family.

00:26:12.848 --> 00:26:13.489
Mutual help

00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:14.489
is only natural.

00:26:14.648 --> 00:26:15.328
I understand.

00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:17.328
But beyond our communal ties,

00:26:19.529 --> 00:26:20.929
I desire more interaction with you.

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:24.648
I understand now.

00:26:25.729 --> 00:26:26.808
You... you understand?

00:26:27.368 --> 00:26:29.209
So you grasp my meaning?

00:26:29.449 --> 00:26:31.049
Since you're a Golden Core cultivator,

00:26:31.168 --> 00:26:32.088
may I

00:26:32.088 --> 00:26:33.128
seek your guidance

00:26:33.168 --> 00:26:34.168
when I have questions?

00:26:34.168 --> 00:26:34.769
No problem.

00:26:35.088 --> 00:26:36.168
I'll share all I know

00:26:36.209 --> 00:26:37.009
without reservation.

00:26:46.969 --> 00:26:47.769
Who's there?

00:26:52.929 --> 00:26:54.009
(I'll see you off.)

00:26:54.328 --> 00:26:55.608
(Don't leave without a word,)

00:26:55.689 --> 00:26:56.489
(Lady Ling Bo.)

00:26:57.368 --> 00:26:58.929
Who asked you to see me off?

00:26:58.929 --> 00:27:00.168
You sly fox.

00:27:08.128 --> 00:27:09.209
(What time will you rise,)

00:27:09.209 --> 00:27:09.969
(Lady Ling Bo?)

00:27:10.249 --> 00:27:11.568
(Don't oversleep.)

00:27:12.408 --> 00:27:14.049
How could I possibly oversleep?

00:27:14.088 --> 00:27:15.368
When have I ever overslept?

00:27:19.368 --> 00:27:20.408
(Right.)

00:27:20.568 --> 00:27:21.449
(Lady Ling Bo)

00:27:21.449 --> 00:27:22.408
(would never oversleep.)

00:27:22.848 --> 00:27:24.529
(Then I'll entrust tomorrow's awakening)

00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:25.848
(to your care, Lady Ling Bo.)

00:27:26.168 --> 00:27:27.209
(I fear I will awake)

00:27:27.209 --> 00:27:28.128
(to find you gone)

00:27:28.568 --> 00:27:29.568
(and miss you.)

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:30.769
(That would be sad.)

00:27:30.969 --> 00:27:31.449
So...

00:27:32.529 --> 00:27:34.408
So what if we miss?

00:27:34.608 --> 00:27:36.009
I'll never wake you up.

00:27:45.888 --> 00:27:46.848
(Just teasing you.)

00:27:47.128 --> 00:27:47.808
(Lady Ling Bo,)

00:27:48.249 --> 00:27:49.769
(I'll come wake you tomorrow.)

00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:50.608
Farewell.

00:27:51.209 --> 00:27:51.929
See you tomorrow.

00:27:57.848 --> 00:27:59.808
Who says I'm seeing you tomorrow?

00:28:05.608 --> 00:28:06.368
What?

00:28:06.568 --> 00:28:07.529
You're bringing him

00:28:07.529 --> 00:28:08.808
back to our sect?

00:28:09.088 --> 00:28:09.729
Yes.

00:28:10.568 --> 00:28:12.009
Don't tell me you plan

00:28:12.088 --> 00:28:13.888
to detain him here

00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:15.328
if he declines your proposal?

00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:18.328
What nonsense.

00:28:18.568 --> 00:28:19.328
I simply want

00:28:19.328 --> 00:28:21.368
to formally introduce him

00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:23.209
to Master.

00:28:24.608 --> 00:28:25.449
Understandable.

00:28:25.848 --> 00:28:27.769
If your master learns

00:28:27.888 --> 00:28:28.888
he's the renowned

00:28:28.888 --> 00:28:29.888
Master Zhong Xi,

00:28:29.969 --> 00:28:31.328
he'll be utterly astonished.

00:28:31.608 --> 00:28:32.769
When you first told me,

00:28:32.808 --> 00:28:33.969
it took me ages to process.

00:28:34.328 --> 00:28:36.689
Zhong Xi or Huan Zong,

00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:37.808
either way,

00:28:38.009 --> 00:28:40.209
he's mine from now on.

00:28:41.648 --> 00:28:42.888
Are you that confident?

00:28:43.009 --> 00:28:45.209
Aren't you worried

00:28:45.568 --> 00:28:46.729
that he never considered

00:28:46.729 --> 00:28:47.969
marrying you?

00:28:48.648 --> 00:28:49.808
How could that be?

00:28:49.808 --> 00:28:50.929
Impossible.

00:28:51.929 --> 00:28:52.769
Ling Hui,

00:28:53.049 --> 00:28:54.168
please teach me.

00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:55.689
What method should I use

00:28:55.689 --> 00:28:56.769
to propose to him?

00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:06.408
Will that work?

00:29:08.648 --> 00:29:09.689
Can I really

00:29:10.328 --> 00:29:11.848
say those words out loud?

00:29:17.249 --> 00:29:17.929
Lin Hu.

00:29:23.249 --> 00:29:23.929
Tomorrow,

00:29:24.328 --> 00:29:25.408
I'll visit Yunhua Sect

00:29:25.408 --> 00:29:26.128
to see the elders.

00:29:26.888 --> 00:29:28.568
Help me check if this outfit works.

00:29:29.328 --> 00:29:30.489
You want my opinion?

00:29:31.529 --> 00:29:32.689
This outfit...

00:29:33.168 --> 00:29:33.769
I think...

00:29:33.808 --> 00:29:34.489
Alright. Stop.

00:29:35.648 --> 00:29:36.088
Wait.

00:29:36.848 --> 00:29:37.408
You...

00:29:37.489 --> 00:29:38.729
Don't be shy.

00:29:38.769 --> 00:29:39.769
I haven't even said it.

00:29:41.368 --> 00:29:42.128
Makes sense.

00:29:42.408 --> 00:29:44.249
It's his first time meeting the elders.

00:29:44.328 --> 00:29:44.848
It's normal.

00:29:49.408 --> 00:29:50.209
How about this one?

00:29:50.848 --> 00:29:51.808
I thought about it.

00:29:51.848 --> 00:29:53.049
Since I'm meeting the elders,

00:29:53.088 --> 00:29:54.689
I should dress more formally.

00:29:54.848 --> 00:29:55.929
That said,

00:29:56.249 --> 00:29:57.328
the Yunhua Sect is used

00:29:57.328 --> 00:29:58.289
to casual freedom.

00:29:58.489 --> 00:29:59.808
Wouldn't being too formal

00:30:00.328 --> 00:30:00.888
be improper?

00:30:03.489 --> 00:30:04.049
Makes sense.

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:07.128
This outfit

00:30:07.128 --> 00:30:08.209
and that outfit,

00:30:08.209 --> 00:30:09.289
changing back and forth.

00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:13.088
How about this one?

00:30:13.529 --> 00:30:15.608
I thought about it carefully.

00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:17.009
Kong Hou has a lively nature.

00:30:17.009 --> 00:30:18.529
I should maintain

00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:20.168
this energetic appearance.

00:30:20.608 --> 00:30:21.568
Young Master,

00:30:22.449 --> 00:30:23.368
every outfit

00:30:23.769 --> 00:30:25.568
looks majestic

00:30:25.608 --> 00:30:27.969
and dashing on you.

00:30:28.408 --> 00:30:29.209
However,

00:30:29.449 --> 00:30:30.848
we should consider one thing.

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:33.328
What do you mean?

00:30:33.608 --> 00:30:35.249
First, we need to decide

00:30:35.249 --> 00:30:36.608
what status you'll claim.

00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:37.328
As a friend?

00:30:37.368 --> 00:30:38.249
If as a friend,

00:30:38.249 --> 00:30:38.969
your outfit choice

00:30:38.969 --> 00:30:39.648
doesn't matter.

00:30:39.689 --> 00:30:40.729
Of course not.

00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:41.729
If not a friend,

00:30:41.729 --> 00:30:42.289
what are you?

00:30:47.009 --> 00:30:47.848
At the very least

00:30:48.449 --> 00:30:50.168
more than an ordinary friend.

00:30:50.529 --> 00:30:51.969
More than an ordinary friend?

00:30:52.049 --> 00:30:52.648
Then what?

00:30:58.888 --> 00:31:00.249
Good news!

00:31:00.408 --> 00:31:01.209
Starting today,

00:31:01.328 --> 00:31:03.729
all suitors proposing to Kong Hou

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:06.168
will receive lifetime free access

00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:08.568
to Yong City's beef noodles.

00:31:08.729 --> 00:31:12.009
First come, first served.

00:31:13.489 --> 00:31:14.969
Doesn't Zhong Xi

00:31:14.969 --> 00:31:17.289
practice fasting?

00:31:20.289 --> 00:31:21.929
It slipped my mind in my haste.

00:31:22.689 --> 00:31:23.368
Then...

00:31:23.449 --> 00:31:25.729
Fasting cultivators can get...

00:31:26.449 --> 00:31:28.249
Get what? What can they get?

00:31:28.328 --> 00:31:29.489
Enough. Stop thinking.

00:31:29.489 --> 00:31:30.449
Oh my dear.

00:31:30.729 --> 00:31:32.449
With your proposal method,

00:31:32.929 --> 00:31:34.408
he'll definitely refuse.

00:31:34.689 --> 00:31:36.449
He might not even want you anymore.

00:31:36.808 --> 00:31:37.929
Just listen to me.

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:38.529
I mean it.

00:31:38.969 --> 00:31:39.969
Ling Hui.

00:31:40.769 --> 00:31:42.009
What should I do then?

00:31:42.009 --> 00:31:43.848
Why is proposing so hard?

00:31:44.249 --> 00:31:44.888
Kong Hou.

00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.848
You came for me?

00:31:49.368 --> 00:31:50.608
What are you two doing?

00:31:51.808 --> 00:31:52.608
Nothing.

00:31:53.769 --> 00:31:55.009
We're enjoying the moon.

00:31:58.368 --> 00:31:59.249
I have things to do.

00:31:59.249 --> 00:31:59.969
I'll leave now.

00:32:00.209 --> 00:32:00.808
Take care.

00:32:06.929 --> 00:32:08.808
Zhong Xi, what are all these?

00:32:11.969 --> 00:32:12.729
These

00:32:13.168 --> 00:32:15.328
are keys to Luanfeng Peak's
Treasure Hall.

00:32:15.608 --> 00:32:16.289
These two

00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:17.408
are storage room keys.

00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:19.969
These are for the archive vaults.

00:32:21.128 --> 00:32:22.368
But why are you showing me

00:32:22.368 --> 00:32:22.969
these?

00:32:23.249 --> 00:32:24.408
What's so special

00:32:24.529 --> 00:32:25.729
about these keys?

00:32:27.168 --> 00:32:27.729
I...

00:32:28.689 --> 00:32:30.368
I want you to keep them for me.

00:32:31.648 --> 00:32:33.249
These are crucial items.

00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:35.168
You want me to keep them?

00:32:36.608 --> 00:32:37.289
Zhong Xi,

00:32:37.808 --> 00:32:39.289
are you going on a long trip?

00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:40.689
I'm not.

00:32:41.209 --> 00:32:42.449
These are meant for you.

00:32:44.168 --> 00:32:45.168
Have you

00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:46.969
lost your keys recently?

00:32:47.929 --> 00:32:48.648
That's not right.

00:32:48.969 --> 00:32:50.249
You're always meticulous.

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:52.168
How could you lose anything?

00:32:59.128 --> 00:32:59.848
Look at this.

00:33:01.128 --> 00:33:02.568
With this key

00:33:02.888 --> 00:33:05.368
you'll become

00:33:05.368 --> 00:33:06.568
another owner

00:33:07.088 --> 00:33:09.689
of Liuguang Sect's
Master Zhong Xi's abode.

00:33:16.249 --> 00:33:19.088
Owner of Zhong Xi's adobe?

00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:30.209
Are... are you...

00:33:31.489 --> 00:33:32.368
Are you...

00:33:34.249 --> 00:33:35.489
Are you saying...

00:33:36.689 --> 00:33:37.449
Zhong Xi,

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:39.608
you want to...

00:33:40.289 --> 00:33:41.729
You finally understand.

00:33:42.408 --> 00:33:42.888
I...

00:33:44.009 --> 00:33:44.648
I...

00:33:45.249 --> 00:33:46.568
No, I don't understand.

00:33:46.969 --> 00:33:47.929
If you hand

00:33:47.929 --> 00:33:49.368
everything to me,

00:33:49.568 --> 00:33:51.568
what if I go broke someday?

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:52.608
I might

00:33:52.608 --> 00:33:53.888
sell a key

00:33:53.888 --> 00:33:54.888
for money.

00:33:54.888 --> 00:33:55.689
That's fine.

00:33:55.769 --> 00:33:57.009
Do as you wish.

00:33:57.088 --> 00:33:58.449
At worst, we'll roam the streets

00:33:59.088 --> 00:34:00.648
together. It doesn't matter.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.494
♪Fade like a poem♪

00:34:04.608 --> 00:34:07.128
We'll be together?

00:34:10.088 --> 00:34:12.248
Let's get married.

00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:17.608
Will you?

00:34:27.088 --> 00:34:28.849
I... I will.

00:34:32.819 --> 00:34:37.472
♪Time engraves into rings♪

00:34:37.536 --> 00:34:44.718
♪Slowly, we accompany the fading lights♪

00:34:48.168 --> 00:34:48.768
Ling Bo?

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:50.728
Lady Ling Bo?

00:34:51.568 --> 00:34:52.849
Lady Ling Bo, rise and shine.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:55.529
Stop knocking.

00:34:56.648 --> 00:34:57.648
I've been up for hours.

00:35:02.168 --> 00:35:02.889
What?

00:35:03.728 --> 00:35:04.288
Nothing.

00:35:05.288 --> 00:35:06.049
Why are you damp?

00:35:08.049 --> 00:35:09.168
I've never seen you

00:35:09.168 --> 00:35:10.529
fresh from bathing before.

00:35:10.728 --> 00:35:11.688
You look great.

00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:13.489
With the scents

00:35:13.648 --> 00:35:14.929
of the cosmetics gone,

00:35:14.969 --> 00:35:15.768
you smell great.

00:35:17.648 --> 00:35:18.728
W-Why are you smiling?

00:35:19.809 --> 00:35:22.009
Don't people say cosmetics

00:35:22.009 --> 00:35:23.128
make one more presentable?

00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:23.728
Right?

00:35:23.768 --> 00:35:24.608
Nonsense.

00:35:24.728 --> 00:35:25.568
That's for people

00:35:25.648 --> 00:35:26.608
with ugly faces.

00:35:26.809 --> 00:35:28.208
You're naturally beautiful.

00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:29.369
No need for those things.

00:35:29.449 --> 00:35:30.688
Natural purity suits you best.

00:35:30.728 --> 00:35:31.248
Really?

00:35:31.449 --> 00:35:32.208
Absolutely.

00:35:32.929 --> 00:35:33.929
You look pretty.

00:35:36.329 --> 00:35:38.248
Well... smooth talker.

00:35:38.489 --> 00:35:39.088
Let's go.

00:35:40.329 --> 00:35:40.969
Wait.

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:41.929
I meant every word.

00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:42.809
This natural look

00:35:42.809 --> 00:35:43.449
suits you best.

00:35:43.449 --> 00:35:44.849
Pure and unadorned.

00:35:44.849 --> 00:35:46.088
Better than heavy makeup.

00:35:46.329 --> 00:35:46.848
I mean it.

00:36:00.969 --> 00:36:01.568
Ling Bo?

00:36:05.288 --> 00:36:05.969
Ling Bo?

00:36:07.449 --> 00:36:08.208
Ling Bo?

00:36:15.904 --> 00:36:19.179
(Haoqing Temple)

00:36:26.409 --> 00:36:27.049
Master,

00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:28.688
still no sign of Lin Hu.

00:36:29.288 --> 00:36:30.248
Let's wait longer.

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:32.608
(So he's Master Zhong Xi.)

00:36:35.969 --> 00:36:36.688
Tan Feng.

00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:37.369
Tan Feng.

00:36:38.449 --> 00:36:39.088
Why do you keep

00:36:39.088 --> 00:36:40.849
staring at Zhong Xi?

00:36:41.809 --> 00:36:42.849
Have you lost your senses?

00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:44.409
I wasn't staring.

00:36:44.608 --> 00:36:45.369
Listen.

00:36:45.449 --> 00:36:46.288
Return like this,

00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:47.568
and Master will be furious.

00:36:47.809 --> 00:36:49.288
How could a marriage be that simple?

00:36:49.809 --> 00:36:51.529
Master Wang Tong
dotes so much on Kong Hou.

00:36:51.608 --> 00:36:52.929
He'd certainly approve.

00:36:53.929 --> 00:36:55.809
My master will definitely agree.

00:36:55.969 --> 00:36:57.128
When that time comes,

00:36:57.608 --> 00:36:59.088
we'll need your support, Tan Feng.

00:37:02.128 --> 00:37:03.529
No problem.

00:37:07.049 --> 00:37:07.929
Where's Lin Hu?

00:37:08.409 --> 00:37:09.768
Why hasn't he returned yet?

00:37:11.728 --> 00:37:12.849
You're really going back?

00:37:13.088 --> 00:37:14.409
Young Master plans

00:37:14.409 --> 00:37:15.288
to marry Kong Hou.

00:37:15.369 --> 00:37:16.329
Why not come with us

00:37:16.329 --> 00:37:17.088
to Yunhua Sect?

00:37:17.369 --> 00:37:18.969
I'll go then when the time comes.

00:37:18.969 --> 00:37:20.969
The back-and-forth is too troublesome.

00:37:21.409 --> 00:37:22.608
None of your business.

00:37:22.768 --> 00:37:23.369
How about this?

00:37:23.409 --> 00:37:25.472
Give me your messenger talisman.
I'll contact you.

00:37:25.568 --> 00:37:26.369
Why should I?

00:37:26.529 --> 00:37:27.768
I'm concerned for your safety

00:37:27.768 --> 00:37:29.009
if you go alone.

00:37:31.369 --> 00:37:32.009
This is mine.

00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:33.728
Well...

00:37:33.929 --> 00:37:34.809
Yours.

00:37:39.369 --> 00:37:39.768
Here.

00:37:43.449 --> 00:37:44.168
Well...

00:37:44.608 --> 00:37:46.288
Stay safe on your journey.

00:37:46.568 --> 00:37:47.489
And

00:37:47.768 --> 00:37:49.608
I lied to you before.

00:37:49.929 --> 00:37:51.449
I'm sorry.

00:37:52.369 --> 00:37:53.409
Don't dwell on it.

00:37:55.889 --> 00:37:56.809
Why are you smiling?

00:37:57.409 --> 00:37:58.969
Be safe on the road.

00:37:59.329 --> 00:38:00.608
Stay vigilant.

00:38:00.929 --> 00:38:02.088
Remember to message me.

00:38:07.648 --> 00:38:08.369
I'm back.

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:08.728
Look.

00:38:11.568 --> 00:38:12.849
Lin Hu, why are you so late?

00:38:12.929 --> 00:38:14.128
We thought you'd left already.

00:38:14.128 --> 00:38:15.128
I... I...

00:38:15.449 --> 00:38:17.088
I went to buy some things

00:38:17.088 --> 00:38:17.728
to bring back.

00:38:18.009 --> 00:38:19.809
Not everyone's here yet.

00:38:19.929 --> 00:38:21.088
Xiao Dong hasn't arrived.

00:38:21.088 --> 00:38:21.688
Master.

00:38:24.449 --> 00:38:25.728
Perfect timing, Xiao Dong.

00:38:26.088 --> 00:38:27.608
Lead the disciples back to the sect.

00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:29.688
I'm going to Yunhua Sect with Kong Hou.

00:38:29.728 --> 00:38:30.128
Master,

00:38:30.648 --> 00:38:31.568
Sect Leader isn't well.

00:38:36.889 --> 00:38:37.632
Master Song He.

00:38:38.088 --> 00:38:38.768
Zhong Xi?

00:38:39.648 --> 00:38:40.849
Why are you back too?

00:38:40.929 --> 00:38:41.529
Master Song He,

00:38:42.529 --> 00:38:43.768
what happened to my master?

00:38:44.208 --> 00:38:45.608
During his cultivation,

00:38:45.688 --> 00:38:46.728
his mental instability

00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:48.329
caused severe energy blockage

00:38:48.329 --> 00:38:49.248
that's hard to resolve.

00:38:49.409 --> 00:38:50.409
Mental instability?

00:38:50.849 --> 00:38:51.568
What caused that?

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:53.208
He's been regretting

00:38:53.449 --> 00:38:55.049
forcing your cultivation
all these years,

00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:56.608
not understanding your struggles.

00:38:56.768 --> 00:38:57.849
The guilt overwhelmed him.

00:38:58.608 --> 00:38:59.409
Now hearing

00:38:59.568 --> 00:39:00.809
that the Yunhua Sect girl

00:39:00.809 --> 00:39:01.889
has become close with you

00:39:01.969 --> 00:39:02.809
as your soulmate,

00:39:02.929 --> 00:39:04.248
he feels relieved,

00:39:04.329 --> 00:39:05.168
yet the guilt

00:39:05.208 --> 00:39:06.449
remains unresolved.

00:39:06.648 --> 00:39:08.208
Years of suppressed emotions

00:39:08.248 --> 00:39:08.728
caused...

00:39:11.128 --> 00:39:11.969
I'll go check on him.

00:39:22.369 --> 00:39:24.608
Master, I'm back.
