[Previously]
When the time is right, you’ll finally see me.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.480
Ma’am, Miss Nid and Miss Ruedee are here to see you.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.840
I have something for you. It’s a gift I inherited from Sophee, my cousin.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.600
What kind of ghost would live in such a tiny pin?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.400
You didn’t see what she was like after she became conscious.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.280
It was very strange…and also scary.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.280
It’s really you, Sophee.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.440
Please dance with me, Kaew.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.040
Time to go home, Kaewta.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.320
I saw someone walking this way but then he just disappeared.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.520
Why didn’t you stop him?

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.880
How could I?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.200
Where is he now?

Khun Yai!

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.280
Why does that man look so much like the one I saw in my dream?

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:43.880
Hey!

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.240
You!

Kaew.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.560
What are you thinking, dear?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.120
Go tell Sin and Saen that their food is ready.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.160
I’m going to make another portion of chilli paste.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.880
Yes, Mum.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.160
How is he, Sin?

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.440
May the Holy Buddha protect him please.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.480
Don’t worry, Dad is taking care of him now.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.240
I’d better go check on them then.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.640
Please make sure those two won’t suspect anything.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.400
Mhm, don’t worry. Please take good care of him.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.480
Yes.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.120
Where’s he?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.800
Dad?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.880
Have you got anything, Sin?

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.960
I already asked Luangta Cham.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.080
There’s only one way to help him.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.840
What is it?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.120
Here.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.760
Luangta wrote it for you.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.200
What does it say?

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.160
I guess we have to give it a try.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.720
But you must be keeping watch upstairs.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.960
Make sure Khun Kaew won’t come down, or you’re dead.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.760
Yes.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.280
Go.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.680
Is there something wrong?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.280
Why is he acting so suspicious?

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.680
Khun Yai, please try to stay conscious to receive the merits.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.080
Luangta Cham is helping you now.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.040
Unbelievable, is there a cellar here too?

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.000
Mum.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.880
Hm?

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.000
Apart from us, Sin, Saen, and Nanny Yam…

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.680
I can feel there’s also someone else in this house.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.800
Who else? It’s just us here.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.760
I don’t know too.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.000
You and your fanciful imagination.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.080
Listen dear,

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.000
if what you said is true; Nanny Yam, Sin, and Saen must have told us already.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.880
But I think those three have been acting suspicious lately.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.920
How?

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.280
I’ll just…let you know when I’m sure about it.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.720
You should go to bed now. Don’t you have to leave early tomorrow?

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.640
Yes.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.480
Go to sleep.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.160
Why does he have to stay on guard? There must be something in there.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.840
Kaew.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.760
No…Don’t come in.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.040
Khun Kaew! What are you doing here?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.640
Holy shit!

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.480
Khun Kaew, what are you doing here?

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.760
I saw you sleeping here to guard this room. What’s in there?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.240
You can’t go into this room.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.880
That’s right.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.640
Why?

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.680
What’s in there?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.680
You can’t go in anyway.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.280
A forbidden area?

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.520
Yeah. That’s what Saen told me.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.960
That’s odd. Aren’t you the house owner, Kaew?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.640
How strange.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.480
Why is there a forbidden area for the house owner?

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.200
I’m not the real owner, Ruedee.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.000
I’m just a tenant like the rest of them.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.520
So, what did you do after that?

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.840
What else do you think?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.200
I could only keep the curiosity to myself…

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.840
…and went back to bed.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.800
So strange. What are they hiding? Why aren’t you allowed to go in there?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.200
Come to think of it, there was a time when I went near that room…

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.120
and saw a shadow of someone.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.000
Whose shadow?

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.200
Hey!

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.040
You!

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.840
Hey!

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.720
Where did he go?

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.800
Or perhaps…is it a house spirit?

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.600
Listen, I think you should go make merits and dedicate them to him.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.800
I’m doing it every day.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.640
But I’m afraid the more I do it, the more I’d see him.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.320
This is creepy.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.600
He probably wants to thank you for dedicating him merits.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.680
Mhm.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.400
Honestly, I don’t think it’s a ghost, Ruedee. It’s a person.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.320
Even so, it’s still creepy.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.600
Excuse me, Ajarn Kitti.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.960
You’re here, Kaew?

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.480
Good morning, sir.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.280
You already submitted your work.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.280
Why are you here, Ruedee?

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.240
Am I not allowed to accompany him?

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.760
So? Where’s your work?

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.360
I thought you said you can’t draw a portrait.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.160
Look at these lines.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.560
and curves,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.640
so soft and gentle...

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.520
truly reflect your own style.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.800
Beautiful indeed.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.440
Someone who could draw like this,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.160
must also possess such a gentle soul.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.440
I think maybe you should stay…

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.760
Kaew!

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.800
You have to go somewhere after this, don’t you?

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.720
Oh, that’s right.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.480
Please excuse us then, Ajarn.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.920
That’s too bad.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.480
I still want to discuss about your thoughts on this drawing.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.359
Thank you, sir.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.760
Maybe I’ll come back for your advice next time.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.480
Let’s go.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.880
Goodbye.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.960
Hey, did you notice how he was looking at you?

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.920
I think he fancies you.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.680
Nonsense, why would he fancy someone like me?

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.760
Thanks for coming with me anyway.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.480
No problem.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.360
How could I let you come here alone?

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.520
Let’s go.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.000
-Thank you, my bestie.
-Yeah.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.240
This way please.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.840
Greetings, Luangta.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.240

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.240
Feeling better now?

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.000
Yes, sir.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.000
My sincere gratitude for your kind help.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.760
Are you talking to me, Luangta?

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.920
I’m feeling better now, Luangta.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.400
I went to the temple the other day and told Lunagta that Da…

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.880
I mean, Saen wasn’t feeling well.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.440
Yes.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.520
You should be more careful.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.040
Don’t bite off more than you could chew again.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.200
Bless you.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.840
Smells so nice.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.040
I thought I’d never see you again, my dear.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.960
So, what’s the matter?

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.240
Why are you looking of a Chuichai dancer?

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:02.240
Well, we’re just looking for a dancer to perform at the party, Miss.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.600
But we might have a little misunderstanding here.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.320
Yes, our apologies to you, Miss.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.560
If you’re looking for a dancer,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.240
you should go to Luang Sanor’s place over there.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.120
Yes, Miss.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.920
We’re leaving then, Miss.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.000
Yes, bless you.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.240
Let’s go, sir. What are you waiting for?

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.640
Why are they looking for Kaew?

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.600
And where’s he now? Why isn’t he home yet?

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.480
[Seller]: Bananas! Want some bananas?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.920
[Seller]: We have fresh kaffir lime leaves too.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.480
[Seller]: Bananas! Bananas!

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.320
[Seller]: Desserts! Want some desserts?

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.200
[Seller]: Bananas! Bananas!

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.960
[Seller]: Kaffir lime leaves! Kaffir lime leaves!

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.760
[Screaming]

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.080
Let go!

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.960
Hey, stop!

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.240
Follow me if you dare!

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.600
Hey! Stop!

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.280
Thief! Catch him!

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.560
Those servants at Luang Sanor’s place were very sure her name is Payom.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.960
How reckless. We could’ve been killed if that were a thief’s lair.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.400
Then we should just arrest them and send them to the police.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.640
Thief! Catch him!

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.800
There’s a thief, Khun Yai.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.760
Thief!

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.800
Move! Out of the way!

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.440
Hey! Stop!

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.120
Stop!

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.200
Lady Chuichai.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.960
Move!

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.200
What a surprise. We’ve been looking for her everywhere.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.800
I’m afraid you’re on your own this time, Khun Yai.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.360
Are you all right?

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.960
You…

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.600
Yes, it’s me.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.600
But…you’re not a lady.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:58.200
You don’t have…br…

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.200
Hey!

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.560
How could I be a lady?

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.760
And why are you blocking my way?

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.480
Well, Sae…

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.200
I’m sorry.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.480
That’s it.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.320
Geez, I’ve lost him now!

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.480
Lady Chuichai is a man?

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.560
Isn’t that a sound of baby birds? Their mother probably left them.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.360
Hang in there, little birds.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.320
What are you going to do, dear?

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.040
Kaewta, what are you doing?

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.840
Naughty as usual.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.640
Come down, dear. Let Sin and Saen do it.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.600
Sin!

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:34.840
Saen!

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.440
Sin!!

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.160
Hey, be careful!

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.400
Kaew!

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.800
Kaewta, are you all right, my dear?

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.040
Who are you?

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.440
I’m talking to you. Who are you?

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.040
You can see me?

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.240
Don’t be ridiculous. Of course I can, I have eyes.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.280
Why are you smiling?

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.000
You still haven’t answered my question.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.960
How did you get in here?

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.240
Well, I…

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.440
Help! We have intruder!

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.160
Saen, Sin! Help!

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.000
Please calm down.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.240
Help!!

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.240
Help!!

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.240
Help! We have an intruder! Saen! Sin! Mum!

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.000
Khun Kaew!

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.920
Khun Kaew!

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.680
Khun Kaew!

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.400
Khun Kaew!

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.560
Help! We have an intruder!

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.960
- What?
- Let’s go!

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.240
Hurry up, Sin!

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.120
Kaew!

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.960
Who’s it? Who?

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.160
Who dares to trespass on our white house?

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.120
Where is he?

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.240
Kaew!

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.120
Right there. He’s quite big, can’t you see him?

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.840
You can see him now, Khun Kaew?

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.840
Don’t be funny, Saen.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.680
Yes, I can see him. I have eyes too.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.800
He can see you!

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.720
Oh, I mean…

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.400
I just answered it for Khun Kaew.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.080
Kaew, are you all right, dear?

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.560
I’m fine, Mum.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.760
But I have no idea how this man got in here.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.160
Is there something funny?

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.960
That’s right. Why are you all smiling?

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.880
Oh, but I’m not smiling.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880
Not at all.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.440
And where are you from, young man?

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.440
Why are you here?

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.280
That’s right. Why do you all seem to know him?

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.160
Who is he, Saen?

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.520
Well…

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.680
Let me officially introduce him to you.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.160
This is Khun Phra…

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.160
I mean, Khun Yai – the landlord of this house.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:02.960
Yes.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.040
-Hello. / -Hello.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.440
Hello.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.360
Landlord? I thought you said I’m the owner of this white house.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.360
A sole inheritor of Chao Meun Samur Jairatch.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.000
Well…

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.400
That is correct. This house belongs to no one else but you.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.160
Please rest assured. You are the true owner of this house.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.440
That’s right.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.760
I mean…

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.080
Khun Yai is a friend of the old landlord.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:44.920
Yes.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.480
I probably forgot to mention it earlier.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.040
A friend?

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.400
Judging from your age…

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.080
it’s hard to believe you’re Khun Phra Nai’s friend.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.440
Is friendship limited by a person’s age? I never know that.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.240
Let’s just say I’m also a tenant.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.760
Does that mean you’ll be staying here too?

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.440
Yes.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.720
The landlord has agreed to let Khun Yai stay here.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.320
Let’s just say, Khun Yai is allowed to reside in this house…

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.560
as stated in the Will made by the old landlord.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.880
So, where have you been all this time?

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.160
That’s right.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.600
No one has ever mentioned about him before.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:54.240
Well, Khun Yai had been away on a business trip for quite a long time.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.680
Exactly.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.080
Yes.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.640
Now that he has returned, we’ve been thinking to introduce him to you.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.440
Yes.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.720
I see. That’s why.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.520
Since you’ve already lived here, then please stay.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.520
What about the house owner, will you allow me to stay?

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:27.400
Doesn’t the Will state that I must allow those who used to live in this house continue their stay?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.240
Good then.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.240
This Khun Yai, I think he must have been away for so long.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:58.000
Look at Nanny Yam, Sin, and Saen. They all seem so thrilled to see him.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.720
What’s wrong, dear?

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.440
Nothing, Mum.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.080
If there’s nothing, I’ll go back to the kitchen then. I’m making some desserts.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:16.840
Yes.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.560
So much alike. The more I look, the more they are alike.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.640
Is it really possible that someone I saw in my dream…

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.000
would also exist in real life as if they’re the same person?

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.920
Khun Kaew finally sees you, Khun Yai.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.280
I’m so happy for you.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.679
I’m happy too. I never thought this day would come.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.920
That’s right. It must be because of Khun Kaew.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.760
Since you’ve met him, you’ve been able to leave this house and roam freely.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.239
Not to mention about today.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.520
Perhaps, it’s the result of those merits we made together in the past, Saen.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.280
So, what should we do after this?

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.840
What do you mean?

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.520
I mean, now that Khun Kaew can see Khun Yai,

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.960
what’s going to happen?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.040
Sin.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:53.960
Yes?

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.920
Let me take care of that for you.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:57.960
Are you sure, Khun Kaew?

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.480
Of course.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.520
You can go watering the plants.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.360
You’ve so much work on hands. You’ll get them done faster this way.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.720
-All right then.
- Good.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.880
-Thank you.
- Yes.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.600
What Sin said earlier, he had a point there.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.080
Now that Khun Kaew can see you,

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.200
what are you going to do next?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.640
The reason why I’m still trapped here and unable to reincarnate…

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.640
Isn’t it because of the love and promise I have given him, Saen?

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.800
As long as Kaew still can’t recall about our past,

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.160
I’m afraid I won’t be able to leave yet.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.640
How are you going to make him remember then?

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.440
Ruedee, have you just woken up?

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.160
I didn’t know you’d be here.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.840
Hello.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:32.000
This girl likes to draw during the night and goes to sleep late. That’s why she’s up very late.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.240
Artists are like that. We could only try to be more understanding, Aunt Nid.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.240
I have an appointment with my brother. Please excuse me then.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.760
You two can enjoy talking without me.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.680
Wait. I’ve been waiting to talk to you. Why such a hurry?

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.880
Sophee is here to see you, Ruedee.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.360
What do you want to talk to me, Sister?

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.960
I’m looking for an artist to draw my portrait.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.840
You want me to do it for you?

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.000
No.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.320
I happened to see your friend’s work.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.200
I like it a lot and want him to draw for me.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.480
My friend? Which one?

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.560
Kaewta.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.960
Well…

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:38.240
You used to tell me that
the scent of Orange Jessamine is soothing and makes you sleep well.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.000
I always remember that.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.960
I will do everything to make you recall those memories about us.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.400
This Song

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.520
It’s your favourite, dear.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.200
Do you still remember?

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.400
Khun Yai.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.720
Oh, good morning. Did you sleep well?

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.040
Yes.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.480
Do you have anything to talk to me?

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.960
What? No, I don’t.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.040
But it looks like you’re waiting for me to come out of my room.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.200
Waiting? What do you mean?

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.840
I also just came out of my room.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.600
Is that your room?

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.840
I thought no one lived there.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.800
I’ve just moved in.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.560
Move in?

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.880
Yes, I used to stay in your room.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.840
Do you mean the room I’m staying in now used to be your room before?

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.480
Nanny Yam has arranged it for me. I’ve absolutely no idea.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.920
I’ll move out as soon as possible.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.000
Don’t worry. No need to move out. You can stay.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.200
But I would feel bad about it.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.280
If it makes you feel that bad,

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.000
then I’ll move in to stay with you.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.560
Wait, Khun Yai.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.000
What did you just say?

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.720
I said…I’ll move in to stay in the same room with you.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.320
I was just kidding.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.400
If that is all, then please excuse me.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.040
Sure.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.160
How could he tease me like that?

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.520
When did you get here?

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.160
It’s so calm and peaceful here.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.800
Such a perfect place for reading, isn’t it?

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.000
No.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.400
That’s good, he’s gone.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:16.720
This song…like what I heard in my dream.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.600
Khun Yai!

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.880
You like this song, don’t you?

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.880
Are you following me?

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.840
It’s rather you who is following me.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.400
I’ll go somewhere else then.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.440
Still sulky as usual.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.160
As usual?

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.520
You talked as if you had known me for a long time.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:40.960
Well…what do you think then?

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.440
What do you mean? Think about what?

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.880
Now that you’ve seen my face, do you think we’ve met before?

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.120
Are you trying to get on my nerves, Khun Yai?

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.760
Not at all. I’m just being honest.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.480
Can’t you try to ponder over it a little?

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.800
I don’t know. Please excuse me.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.920
Khun Yai.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.320
Do you intend to follow me everywhere?

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.440
Is that what you think?

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:21.040
But I believe it’s rather us being destined to meet wherever we go.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.040
You!

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.080
Khun Kaew. Miss Ruedee is here to see you.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.400
Kaew.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.600
Ruedee.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.320
Thank you, Sin.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.000
You’re welcome.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.760
Aww, is this what being “head over heels” is like?

00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.320
Want it, rascal?

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.400
I’d better go. Bye.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.240
It’s good you’re here, Ruedee.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.480
Kaew, who’s that man?

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.160
That’s Khun Yai, a friend of the old landlord.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.240
He also lives here.

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.080
Hello.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.880
Hello, Miss Ruedee.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.960
Please feel free. I’ll leave you two alone then.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.160
Hey, how did he know my name?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.640
I wonder too. Maybe Sin or Saen has mentioned it to him.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:51:00.800
Wait, why does he look so familiar to me though?

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:34.280
Look at you, you’re following him like a shadow, Khun Yai.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.640
I’ve been like this ever since Kaew came to live here.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.280
Can’t see anything wrong with it.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.960
But Khun Kaew can see you now.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.080
He might be suspicious.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.680
But I want to be near him.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:57.920
Aren’t you the same too? You also rush here because Miss Ruedee is here.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:03.920
A lowly person like me could only keep looking at her from afar like this in every life.

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.640
-Ruedee.
- Hm?

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.560
You already saw his face clearly, didn’t you?

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.600
He looks…

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.960
Exactly like that man you drew.

00:52:58.920 --> 00:52:59.960
Yes.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.360
I didn’t imagine it, did I?

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.240
But how is this possible?

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:11.400
Isn’t that portrait of a man in your dream?

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.720
That’s right. I never thought he’d really exist.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.600
Where has he been all this time?

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.240
Last time I came, I couldn’t remember seeing him here.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:30.160
Saen said he had been away on a business trip.

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:37.480
Kaew, are you sure you’ve never seen or met him before?

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.680
Why else would you dream of him and could even draw his portrait?

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.640
Yes, I’m sure.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.080
How odd.

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:58.000
Anyway, why do you want to see me?

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.960
My cousin, Sophee, wants you to draw for her.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.800
She’s here too?

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.960
The White House.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.360
Kaew!

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:49.880
Why did you do that?

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.440
You want to know why?

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.480
Grab him!

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.200
Let me go!

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.680
Lady Sophee.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:08.920
Is this the renowned white house of Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:13.120
Khun Phra Nai is infatuated with the dancer, so much that he neglects to do his work.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.880
[Next Episode]
Hello, Brother.

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.840
Please come inside.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.560
This is Khun Yai and Saen.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.480
They also live here.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.240
A pleasure to meet you.

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.440
Is this the renowned white house of Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.400
Miss Sophee.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.800
What is the reason for your visit, Lady Sophee?

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.880
I’d like to know that too.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.320
How many people live here?

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.440
Think carefully before you answer, Sin.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.880
Hey, earlier I walked into the scene when… when you still hadn’t finished getting dressed.

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.120
- How was it? / - I almost died.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:34.640
Give me some encouragement. I have to sit here meditating all day.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:38.520
You said you saw… that state I was in.

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:41.720
Cheer me up today… without even saying anything.

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.680
Whoa… this much, huh?

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.520
Khun Yai.

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.040
Khun Yai, sir.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:08.440
Please don’t do that again, sir. You scared the life out of me.

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.360
What are you daydreaming about, dear?

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.720
Go call Sin and Saen to come eat, okay?

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.960
I think I’ll make another batch of chili paste.

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.640
Okay, Mom.

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.640
Let go of me!!

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.000
Hey! Stop right there!

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.160
If you’re so tough, then come get me!

00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.520
Hey! Stop! Stop!

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.640
Crap, everything’s ruined!

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.720
Help! Help! Someone catch the thief!

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.200
This scene is where Khun Phra Nai is looking for the Chui-Chai dancer who…

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.600
- Impressed by.
- Waiting for so long… but he can’t find him.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.800
Right.

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.760
Because when he went to the house, he only found Payom instead.

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.040
Yeah, they didn’t meet.

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.720
Right, so they end up meeting at the market.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.400
Today we’re catching a thief and then. hey!

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.080
That’s the lady we’ve been looking for!

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.280
But then..

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.680
- He even came all the way here. / - You’re not a lady.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.400
But you are…

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.840
How could I possibly be a lady?

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.880
Here, here! try doing this. Like this! oops!

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.440
- You’re not a lady..? / - Oh!

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.360
How could I be a lady?

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.840
Because I’m… a kathoey.*
(*kathoey = Thai transgender/gender-diverse identity, kept original nuance)

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:53.920
Oh.

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:07.040
- Today we filmed queue 1, scene 1. / - Scene 1.

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.200
- And it went surprisingly well. / - True.

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:13.840
Nothing got stuck. The acting rhythm was super smooth. We all gossip too much.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.640
A new morning after we leave Mom behind.

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:36.000
Then when we came downstairs, we saw Nany Yam and P’Sin whispering about something.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.440
So I was like, huh?

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:43.800
Something seemed off. Because Khun Yai is sick. he used his powers.

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:49.080
And when he uses his power, he becomes translucent. When he’s like that, he can’t meet people.

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.240
I also wondered where he had gone.

00:59:53.240 --> 01:00:00.560
And then I saw that Khun Yai used up more power fighting.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.320
They said we’d be filming inside a secret tunnel that was pretty narrow.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.480
I didn’t think it would be this narrow.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.960
It’s so tight that you have to walk single file inside.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.800
With just one camera set up, it almost filled the whole frame.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.480
I don’t know why Khun Yai likes this place so much. There are plenty of better ones.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.040
Oh right! he’s a ghost. He has to hide from Kaewta. Makes sense.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.760
His power’s weak lately too. We need to make a lot of merit for him.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:39.280
This is a prop, okay? Not real.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.280
That’s why the sound it makes is like…

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.920
Stop, it’s making my teeth hurt.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.400
This scene is a dream sequence…

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.920
♫ A flower…when blooming ♫

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.080
♫ Its fragrance still fills the air…even after a long time ♫

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.160
