It's windy outside. Come in and sleep.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:44.736
That's not appropriate.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:47.855
I...

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:53.215
I-I'll sleep on the floor.

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:55.055
Don't stand on ceremony with me.

00:01:58.055 --> 00:01:59.615
Don't be afraid.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:00.536
I'm not afraid.

00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:01.775
Really, I'm not afraid.

00:02:02.016 --> 00:02:02.855
I'm fine.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:03.736
I'll take the floor.

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:13.576
Ling Bo,

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:14.856
snap out of it.

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:16.335
Getting shy?

00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:18.495
Regain your senses, Ling Bo.

00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:19.495
Snap out of it.

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:20.495
It's the demonic aura.

00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:21.095
You know?

00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:23.296
The demonic aura doesn't control me.

00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:24.375
My mind's perfectly clear.

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:29.215
Why are you avoiding me?

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:31.736
Didn't you say you like me?

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:33.215
Ling Bo, come to your senses.

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:34.456
Demonic aura controls you.

00:02:34.576 --> 00:02:36.176
You're asking for this.

00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:37.335
Ling Bo!

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:42.976
Ling Bo?

00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:48.535
What should I do now?

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:50.176
The messenger talismans are used up.

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:51.095
What should I do?

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:55.576
Lin Hu, open the door.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:56.375
What...

00:02:56.456 --> 00:02:57.736
What kind of lust demon's aura

00:02:57.736 --> 00:02:58.696
could cause this effect?

00:02:58.775 --> 00:02:59.815
This makes no sense.

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:01.696
It's all your fault.

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:03.495
Let me out first.

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:04.095
Yes.

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:04.976
My fault entirely.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:05.696
Lin Hu?

00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:07.535
Lin Hu?

00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:08.256
Ling Bo?

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:10.055
Ling Bo? Is that you?

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:10.815
What's happening?

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:12.176
Let me out!

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:13.736
Well...

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:14.256
Wait.

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:16.016
What should I do?

00:03:19.256 --> 00:03:20.016
Firewood?

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:22.736
Zhou Xiao.

00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:23.775
I promise

00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:24.775
no matter what we see

00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:25.576
in the mirror,

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:26.696
I won't laugh.

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:30.655
Jin Ling, I was afraid you'd be angry.

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:32.335
I'd be angry?

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:33.495
Why would I be angry?

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:34.456
You...

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:36.896
I know.

00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:37.935
Did you do something

00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:38.775
to wrong me?

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:39.896
How could that be?

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:41.576
Well. Not exactly.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:42.576
Besides,

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:43.215
what could I

00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:44.416
possibly do to wrong you?

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:46.215
You're looking in this mirror.

00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:46.775
No.

00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:47.416
- Jin Ling.
- Let go.

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:48.696
- Let go.
- Have mercy on me.

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:49.495
I won't do it!

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.055
Let it go.

00:03:50.055 --> 00:03:51.456
I'll confess my mistake. Alright?

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:52.935
Well.

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:53.696
So your 'mistake'

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:54.696
isn't trivial after all.

00:03:54.696 --> 00:03:55.696
No. It's not like that.

00:03:55.696 --> 00:03:56.976
If you're admitting guilt now,

00:03:57.055 --> 00:03:57.896
I must see

00:03:57.896 --> 00:03:59.215
what exactly you've done.

00:03:59.256 --> 00:04:00.215
Chi, Chi.

00:04:00.215 --> 00:04:01.375
Speak up for me, Chi.

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:03.456
I can't help you here.

00:04:03.655 --> 00:04:05.176
Best to face it directly.

00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:06.896
There's no hiding the truth.

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:07.775
See?

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:08.256
He

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:09.535
sides with me.

00:04:09.696 --> 00:04:12.335
Cooperate nicely now

00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:13.535
to look in this mirror,

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:15.136
and I might forgive you.

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:18.335
Fine.

00:04:25.256 --> 00:04:26.095
(What?)

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:28.616
(They say I like Jin Ling?)

00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:30.616
(I raised her since childhood.)

00:04:30.655 --> 00:04:32.016
(To me, she's a little sister.)

00:04:32.016 --> 00:04:33.295
(Impossible.)

00:04:33.535 --> 00:04:36.095
(Though she's kind to me,)

00:04:36.215 --> 00:04:37.256
(to others,)

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:38.735
(she's fierce.)

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:40.895
(She's just a complete)

00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:42.936
(tigress.)

00:04:44.215 --> 00:04:44.936
Jin Ling,

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:46.376
I was wrong.

00:04:47.016 --> 00:04:48.456
I truly know I was wrong.

00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:49.256
Don't be angry.

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:50.095
Well...

00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:50.775
Fine.

00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:51.295
Wait.

00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:52.256
You think I'm fierce?

00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:52.855
No.

00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:53.936
Today I'll show you

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:55.056
what real fierceness is.

00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:56.136
You...

00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:57.215
Jin Ling, no violence.

00:04:57.215 --> 00:04:57.855
Cultivators.

00:04:57.855 --> 00:04:58.775
No hitting, alright?

00:04:58.775 --> 00:04:59.256
Come here.

00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:00.095
- Cultivators.
- Chi.

00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:01.056
Help me.

00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:01.856
- Cultivators.
- Come.

00:05:01.856 --> 00:05:02.655
Don't harm the bond.

00:05:02.655 --> 00:05:03.535
Come here.

00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:05.175
Walk over and I won't hit you.

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:06.535
You promise.

00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:08.616
No hitting, right?

00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:09.496
I won't hit you. Come.

00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:10.016
Jin Ling,

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:11.016
calm down.

00:05:11.175 --> 00:05:12.456
Calm down?

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:15.816
You dare dodge?

00:05:15.936 --> 00:05:16.816
Jin Ling,

00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:18.095
it's a treasure after all.

00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:19.215
Don't toss it around.

00:05:19.256 --> 00:05:20.056
Right?

00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:25.655
She's a young girl.

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:26.576
Just coax her,

00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:27.576
Zhou Xiao.

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:32.535
You're right.

00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:34.095
Go quickly.

00:05:37.056 --> 00:05:38.535
(The person in the mirror earlier)

00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:39.775
(seemingly wasn't him.)

00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:42.735
(But he helped me save Jin Ling)

00:05:42.855 --> 00:05:44.056
(and acted so openly.)

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:46.136
(Did I see wrong?)

00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:47.616
(Or am I overthinking?)

00:05:55.735 --> 00:05:57.975
Immortal Bo Yuan's secret techniques

00:05:58.056 --> 00:05:59.376
are finally mastered.

00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:01.056
Are you confident now

00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:02.415
to pass the trial?

00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:04.016
I'm not sure,

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:06.016
but I'll give my all.

00:06:06.136 --> 00:06:06.936
Why don't you ask

00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:08.215
if I'm confident?

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:09.936
Do I even need to ask?

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:12.016
You'll surely succeed.

00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:13.376
I have faith in you.

00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:16.816
(North and south, civil and martial.)

00:06:16.936 --> 00:06:18.016
(Endless strife.)

00:06:18.136 --> 00:06:20.136
(Constant killing and slashing.)

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:21.256
(Plundering everywhere.)

00:06:21.335 --> 00:06:23.735
(All cleared and barren.)

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.415
Why more couplets?

00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:26.456
I know.

00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:29.655
Every household, women and men.

00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:30.616
Left desolate.

00:06:30.735 --> 00:06:32.376
Endless panic and terror.

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:33.376
Weeping forever.

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:35.576
Truly tragic and miserable.

00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:39.975
You two really

00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:41.576
don't play by the rules.

00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:44.136
(If I say you can, you can,)

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:44.975
(even if you can't.)

00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:46.095
He's cheating.

00:06:46.095 --> 00:06:47.456
He's just being witty.

00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:48.335
Watch me.

00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:50.535
If you say I can't, I can't,

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.655
even if I can.

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:55.696
(Rice for cooking.)

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:57.295
Reason for arguing.

00:06:58.095 --> 00:06:59.655
What nonsense is this?

00:07:01.696 --> 00:07:02.456
(Rice for cooking.)

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:03.256
See?

00:07:03.376 --> 00:07:05.256
Immortal Bo Yuan's stopped reacting.

00:07:05.576 --> 00:07:07.496
Challenging me in wit

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:10.136
is like an ant trying to lift a tree,

00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:11.335
overestimating yourself.

00:07:13.256 --> 00:07:14.256
Huan Zong?

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:15.735
Don't be afraid.

00:07:15.775 --> 00:07:17.256
What's happening?

00:07:17.376 --> 00:07:18.735
I see.

00:07:19.456 --> 00:07:21.936
We're outside the ice sphere.

00:07:22.735 --> 00:07:23.535
Wait,

00:07:24.056 --> 00:07:25.175
we've connected both sides

00:07:25.175 --> 00:07:26.535
of the ice sphere.

00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:27.655
We're out.

00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:28.855
Look there.

00:07:36.576 --> 00:07:37.896
What's this?

00:07:38.175 --> 00:07:39.175
Could it be

00:07:39.175 --> 00:07:41.056
Immortal Bo Yuan's reward?

00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:42.775
Just open it and find out.

00:07:47.335 --> 00:07:48.456
Three treasures.

00:07:48.456 --> 00:07:50.175
Choose only one.

00:07:51.056 --> 00:07:52.215
This looks

00:07:52.215 --> 00:07:54.136
like a trap.

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:57.016
Only one out of three options.

00:07:58.775 --> 00:07:59.775
You're the lucky one.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:00.696
You choose.

00:08:00.816 --> 00:08:01.975
Then I'll choose.

00:08:03.936 --> 00:08:05.376
Eeny, meeny,

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:08.655
miny, moe.

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:12.335
That's the one.

00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:13.376
Open it.

00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:21.016
Huan Zong, look at this.

00:08:21.136 --> 00:08:23.696
By reciting the spell,
the destined bearer

00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:24.735
of this talisman

00:08:24.855 --> 00:08:26.855
can teleport to any destination

00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:29.655
within the secret realm
except the forbidden area

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:31.935
for demons in the circle.

00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:34.336
Should I test it?

00:08:36.256 --> 00:08:38.175
Creation is from void.
Unformed at first,

00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:39.455
it shall be done.

00:08:39.575 --> 00:08:42.575
I must reunite
with Lin Hu and the others.

00:08:57.896 --> 00:08:58.815
What's that?

00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:00.295
Why is there dark smoke?

00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:01.775
Chi Si.

00:09:04.455 --> 00:09:05.535
What's that?

00:09:16.935 --> 00:09:17.535
I can't leave.

00:09:17.535 --> 00:09:18.856
But I can call for help.

00:09:18.896 --> 00:09:19.535
I wonder

00:09:19.535 --> 00:09:20.415
if they'll see it.

00:09:22.815 --> 00:09:23.736
Is anyone there?

00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:25.055
(Qin Residence)
Anyone inside?

00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:27.216
Yes.

00:09:27.415 --> 00:09:28.935
Lady Jin Ling?

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:30.336
- Help!
- Lin Hu?

00:09:30.455 --> 00:09:31.616
It's Lin Hu.

00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:33.136
Lin Hu, hold on.

00:09:33.295 --> 00:09:34.295
(Demon Containment, Cultivators Beware)
We'll go in.

00:09:34.336 --> 00:09:35.055
Lady Jin Ling,

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:36.976
this manor reeks of demonic aura

00:09:37.096 --> 00:09:38.856
and definitely has a barrier.

00:09:39.016 --> 00:09:40.096
The demonic aura is strong.

00:09:40.216 --> 00:09:42.016
This barrier won't be easy to break.

00:09:42.055 --> 00:09:43.336
Didn't you hear Lin Hu's cry?

00:09:43.336 --> 00:09:44.175
We must enter.

00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:45.016
Wait.

00:09:46.455 --> 00:09:47.216
Jin Ling,

00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:49.376
the stone tablet said this place

00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:50.736
only traps demon cultivators.

00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:51.575
What does that mean?

00:09:51.616 --> 00:09:53.256
You mean Lin Hu is a demon cultivator?

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:54.856
What? Lin Hu's a demon cultivator?

00:09:54.856 --> 00:09:55.655
Didn't you say

00:09:55.655 --> 00:09:56.775
it traps demon cultivators?

00:09:56.815 --> 00:09:58.415
You said Lin Hu's a demon cultivator.

00:09:58.496 --> 00:09:59.695
Are you questioning me?

00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:00.496
I barely know him.

00:10:00.496 --> 00:10:00.976
I don't know

00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:01.815
if he is.

00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:02.896
I'm not questioning you.

00:10:02.896 --> 00:10:03.935
I'm reasoning with you.

00:10:03.935 --> 00:10:05.055
You always misread me.

00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:05.695
I misread you?

00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:06.736
I do that every day.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:07.535
So I'm fierce,

00:10:07.655 --> 00:10:08.535
and you hate me, huh?

00:10:08.535 --> 00:10:10.016
Why are you bringing that up again?

00:10:10.016 --> 00:10:11.096
Cultivators!

00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:14.535
I think...

00:10:14.695 --> 00:10:15.616
Well...

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:16.815
Zhou Xiao suggests...

00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:17.616
Here's the thing.

00:10:17.695 --> 00:10:19.136
Since this place

00:10:19.216 --> 00:10:20.376
only traps demon cultivators,

00:10:20.575 --> 00:10:21.896
we regular cultivators

00:10:22.016 --> 00:10:23.535
should be able to enter safely.

00:10:24.096 --> 00:10:25.336
I'll try.

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:49.935
Are you okay?

00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:51.775
Lady Jin Ling.

00:10:52.096 --> 00:10:53.175
Take the medicine.

00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:03.616
Please.

00:11:03.815 --> 00:11:05.415
Please save Ling Bo.

00:11:05.976 --> 00:11:06.935
What?

00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:08.415
Lady Ling Bo is here too?

00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:09.775
She's hit by the demonic aura.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.856
We're trapped here.

00:11:12.496 --> 00:11:13.415
Stay calm.

00:11:13.455 --> 00:11:14.455
We'll find a way.

00:11:14.496 --> 00:11:15.175
Alright.

00:11:24.896 --> 00:11:26.055
Ling Bo's inside.

00:11:36.535 --> 00:11:37.896
You're back.

00:11:38.455 --> 00:11:40.295
Let me out now.

00:11:43.856 --> 00:11:45.216
Let me out!

00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:50.256
She's been raging like this.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.616
I couldn't restrain her.

00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:53.455
So I sealed her temporarily.

00:11:53.935 --> 00:11:55.336
Seeing Lady Ling Bo like this,

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:57.376
how much she must be suffering.

00:11:57.655 --> 00:11:58.415
This happened

00:11:58.415 --> 00:11:59.415
because of me.

00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:00.175
I don't know

00:12:00.175 --> 00:12:01.136
what I should do now.

00:12:01.295 --> 00:12:02.295
- Now I...
- Enough.

00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:03.455
Stop blaming yourself.

00:12:03.575 --> 00:12:05.055
This isn't entirely your fault.

00:12:05.256 --> 00:12:06.935
Who could've known the demonic aura here

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:07.935
would be this intense?

00:12:09.535 --> 00:12:10.935
Let's regulate her energy together

00:12:11.016 --> 00:12:12.935
and see if we can
dispel the demonic aura.

00:12:32.775 --> 00:12:34.415
Lin Hu, stop at once.

00:12:34.535 --> 00:12:35.815
Don't force yourself.

00:12:41.016 --> 00:12:41.775
Ling Bo?

00:12:52.976 --> 00:12:53.655
Ling Bo,

00:12:54.496 --> 00:12:55.256
don't worry.

00:12:56.096 --> 00:12:56.736
I will

00:12:56.736 --> 00:12:57.976
expel the demonic aura

00:12:58.096 --> 00:12:59.016
within you.

00:12:59.616 --> 00:13:01.336
And we'll surely get out of here.

00:13:01.455 --> 00:13:02.616
Safely.

00:13:07.535 --> 00:13:08.535
This place...

00:13:08.535 --> 00:13:09.775
It doesn't seem

00:13:09.896 --> 00:13:11.935
like it contains any Merfolk Scales.

00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:13.896
Did someone bring the Merfolk Scale

00:13:13.896 --> 00:13:14.775
here before?

00:13:14.935 --> 00:13:16.455
That's why we were

00:13:16.455 --> 00:13:17.295
brought here.

00:13:18.016 --> 00:13:18.935
This note

00:13:18.935 --> 00:13:20.376
is completely useless.

00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:22.815
The note might not be useless.

00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:24.896
Let me try again then.

00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:29.055
Creation is from void.
Unformed at first,

00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:30.016
it shall be done.

00:13:30.016 --> 00:13:31.216
I want to find Lin Hu.

00:13:33.336 --> 00:13:34.055
See?

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:35.736
It's truly useless.

00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:37.935
Immortal Bo Yuan deceived us.

00:13:38.096 --> 00:13:39.736
Probably not a deception.

00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:43.376
Does this spell

00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:44.736
have a mind of its own?

00:13:45.856 --> 00:13:49.575
It says we can go anywhere

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:51.216
except the forbidden area for demons.

00:13:51.336 --> 00:13:52.896
Since Lin Hu is a demon cultivator,

00:13:53.055 --> 00:13:54.055
he must be trapped

00:13:54.055 --> 00:13:54.856
somewhere.

00:13:55.175 --> 00:13:56.976
So we can't reach

00:13:56.976 --> 00:13:57.976
where he is trapped.

00:13:57.976 --> 00:13:59.655
Is Lin Hu in danger then?

00:13:59.815 --> 00:14:01.055
I already told him to send

00:14:01.136 --> 00:14:02.136
messenger talismans

00:14:02.136 --> 00:14:03.535
at regular intervals.

00:14:03.575 --> 00:14:04.655
But after all this time,

00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:05.815
there's been no word.

00:14:07.016 --> 00:14:08.535
He must have encountered trouble.

00:14:08.695 --> 00:14:10.096
Should we go rescue him?

00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:11.295
Given his abilities,

00:14:11.295 --> 00:14:12.896
I have faith in him.

00:14:13.415 --> 00:14:14.295
However...

00:14:14.815 --> 00:14:15.616
However what?

00:14:17.736 --> 00:14:19.016
I'm just wondering

00:14:19.336 --> 00:14:21.055
why we haven't vanished.

00:14:21.415 --> 00:14:23.616
Could it mean the Merfolk Scale

00:14:23.736 --> 00:14:26.535
is in this demonic containment area?

00:14:26.775 --> 00:14:29.775
That's why we didn't get transported?

00:14:29.856 --> 00:14:32.016
Moreover, merfolk were previously

00:14:32.016 --> 00:14:32.815
considered by all

00:14:32.976 --> 00:14:34.055
as demonic beings, right?

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:37.336
I think there's another possibility.

00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:40.775
The Merfolk Scale might still be there.

00:14:41.055 --> 00:14:43.096
Are you suggesting

00:14:43.695 --> 00:14:45.216
the Merfolk Scale

00:14:45.376 --> 00:14:46.976
is in Immortal Bo Yuan's residence?

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:47.775
Jin Ling.

00:14:50.935 --> 00:14:52.256
Here, drink some water.

00:14:58.976 --> 00:15:01.096
After we leave this secret realm

00:15:01.216 --> 00:15:02.216
and return to the sect,

00:15:06.216 --> 00:15:07.175
let's get married.

00:15:08.096 --> 00:15:09.775
I-I don't want to marry you.

00:15:10.216 --> 00:15:11.575
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:12.736
Stop joking around.

00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:14.336
I'm not joking.

00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:15.896
I know I'm fierce.

00:15:16.256 --> 00:15:17.295
And I also know

00:15:17.535 --> 00:15:19.655
forced relationships never thrive.

00:15:19.736 --> 00:15:21.616
Jin Ling, I was foolish back then.

00:15:21.695 --> 00:15:22.896
I spoke without thinking.

00:15:22.976 --> 00:15:23.336
It proves

00:15:23.336 --> 00:15:24.575
I wasn't in your heart at all.

00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:27.055
You were. You've always been there.

00:15:27.775 --> 00:15:29.856
Jin Ling, please don't be angry.

00:15:30.575 --> 00:15:32.455
Now I finally understand.

00:15:32.736 --> 00:15:33.856
Especially after

00:15:35.016 --> 00:15:35.896
experiencing all those

00:15:35.896 --> 00:15:36.736
sect upheavals.

00:15:39.655 --> 00:15:41.216
I was terrified back then.

00:15:41.415 --> 00:15:42.256
I feared

00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:43.575
if you never woke up,

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:44.336
what would I do?

00:15:44.415 --> 00:15:45.896
I couldn't bear to imagine

00:15:45.976 --> 00:15:46.695
how to live

00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:47.736
a life without you.

00:15:47.896 --> 00:15:49.415
From that moment, I decided

00:15:49.695 --> 00:15:51.096
that if you could just wake up,

00:15:54.016 --> 00:15:55.575
I'd stay with you forever.

00:15:55.695 --> 00:15:56.896
Never to part.

00:15:57.496 --> 00:15:58.455
Are...

00:15:59.016 --> 00:16:00.216
Are you telling the truth?

00:16:00.295 --> 00:16:01.336
Of course.

00:16:03.175 --> 00:16:04.016
Jin Ling,

00:16:04.256 --> 00:16:05.695
can you forgive me?

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:11.616
How can you prove you're

00:16:11.616 --> 00:16:12.575
telling the truth?

00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:14.096
I'll prove it any way you want.

00:16:14.336 --> 00:16:15.175
Whatever you want,

00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:15.976
I'll do it.

00:16:21.775 --> 00:16:24.216
This room would be nicer

00:16:24.295 --> 00:16:25.616
with some flowers.

00:16:28.935 --> 00:16:29.815
That's simple enough.

00:16:29.896 --> 00:16:30.896
I'll be right back.

00:16:31.256 --> 00:16:31.815
Wait for me.

00:17:40.056 --> 00:17:41.415
The demonic aura here is thick.

00:17:41.655 --> 00:17:42.975
It must be the place.

00:18:42.415 --> 00:18:43.776
Who is it?

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:44.816
I'll collect something.

00:18:45.136 --> 00:18:47.576
This place belongs to Immortal Bo Yuan.

00:18:47.896 --> 00:18:49.215
Where's your token?

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.175
With you,

00:19:17.616 --> 00:19:19.455
the great cause is assured.

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:45.255
(He was sneaking around.)

00:19:45.255 --> 00:19:46.376
(What did he take?)

00:19:46.536 --> 00:19:48.455
(And who was
that mirror figure earlier?)

00:19:48.576 --> 00:19:49.975
Calm down?

00:19:50.495 --> 00:19:51.935
You dare dodge?

00:19:57.096 --> 00:19:57.975
She's a young girl.

00:19:57.975 --> 00:19:59.015
Just coax her.

00:19:59.255 --> 00:20:00.655
(The great cause is assured?)

00:20:01.695 --> 00:20:03.576
(What's Chi Si plotting?)

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:05.816
(Who even is he?)

00:20:06.056 --> 00:20:07.255
Zhou Xiao.

00:20:10.975 --> 00:20:11.975
Why were you

00:20:11.975 --> 00:20:12.655
sneaking around?

00:20:13.856 --> 00:20:15.015
You saw everything already.

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:16.616
No explanations needed.

00:20:17.455 --> 00:20:18.175
Then what exactly

00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:19.215
did you take?

00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:22.695
You want to know?

00:20:24.215 --> 00:20:25.096
Zhou Xiao,

00:20:25.255 --> 00:20:26.735
I'd advise you to remain ignorant

00:20:26.735 --> 00:20:27.455
for your own good.

00:20:27.776 --> 00:20:29.376
Because if I tell you,

00:20:31.455 --> 00:20:33.576
I can't let you live anymore.

00:20:34.856 --> 00:20:36.376
Enough of your empty threats.

00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:37.776
Taking my life

00:20:37.816 --> 00:20:38.856
is not that easy.

00:20:39.735 --> 00:20:40.536
Speak.

00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:41.935
Who are you really?

00:20:42.096 --> 00:20:44.096
If you can survive under my blade,

00:20:44.255 --> 00:20:45.175
then I'll tell you

00:20:45.336 --> 00:20:46.376
who I am.

00:20:49.136 --> 00:20:49.896
Ling Bo?

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:55.136
Ling Bo!

00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:56.376
Ling Bo,

00:20:56.376 --> 00:20:57.455
what happened to you?

00:20:57.455 --> 00:20:58.655
You were fine moments ago.

00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:00.495
Lin Hu, what's going on?

00:21:01.776 --> 00:21:02.935
Her demonic aura has surged,

00:21:02.935 --> 00:21:03.975
unlike before.

00:21:07.296 --> 00:21:07.856
But

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:09.495
she was almost healed earlier.

00:21:11.056 --> 00:21:11.935
Lin Hu, are you

00:21:12.056 --> 00:21:13.136
forming a demonic pact

00:21:13.136 --> 00:21:14.015
with Lady Ling Bo

00:21:14.096 --> 00:21:15.136
to draw her demonic aura

00:21:15.136 --> 00:21:16.376
into yourself?

00:21:27.816 --> 00:21:28.735
Lady Ling Bo?

00:21:40.455 --> 00:21:41.415
Lin Hu,

00:21:41.616 --> 00:21:42.776
what are you doing?

00:21:43.096 --> 00:21:43.776
Your fox tail

00:21:43.776 --> 00:21:45.175
contains all your spiritual energy.

00:21:46.495 --> 00:21:48.376
This will cripple your cultivation.

00:22:00.975 --> 00:22:01.975
Ling Bo,

00:22:02.776 --> 00:22:04.655
this settles my debt to you.

00:22:09.175 --> 00:22:10.015
Wait here.

00:22:10.096 --> 00:22:11.695
I'll fetch Zhou Xiao for help.

00:22:23.695 --> 00:22:24.495
Zhou Xiao.

00:22:25.856 --> 00:22:28.056
Jin Ling? Run!

00:22:28.255 --> 00:22:29.255
What's going on?

00:22:29.495 --> 00:22:30.655
What are you?

00:22:35.576 --> 00:22:36.655
Jin Ling!

00:22:41.616 --> 00:22:42.776
Zhou Xiao.

00:22:43.576 --> 00:22:44.376
Jin Ling.

00:22:46.776 --> 00:22:48.056
Zhou Xiao.

00:22:49.856 --> 00:22:51.296
What a pity...

00:22:53.096 --> 00:22:54.136
We

00:22:55.816 --> 00:22:58.816
won't grow old together.

00:23:05.536 --> 00:23:06.376
Jin Ling?

00:23:06.735 --> 00:23:07.616
Jin Ling!

00:23:07.856 --> 00:23:08.655
Stay with me.

00:23:08.776 --> 00:23:10.376
Jin Ling, wake up.

00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:12.856
Jin Ling, listen to me.

00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:13.695
Stay with me.

00:23:14.215 --> 00:23:15.255
Jin Ling.

00:23:33.336 --> 00:23:34.776
Should we head back first

00:23:34.776 --> 00:23:36.536
or look for Lin Hu and the others first?

00:23:36.655 --> 00:23:37.576
Cultivators.

00:23:39.336 --> 00:23:40.536
We met before entering.

00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:42.136
I'm Chi Si, a rogue cultivator.

00:23:43.296 --> 00:23:44.056
Sorry.

00:23:44.096 --> 00:23:45.175
My memory isn't the best.

00:23:45.296 --> 00:23:47.255
I'm Kong Hou from Yunhua Sect.

00:23:47.415 --> 00:23:49.776
This is Huan Zong from Liuguang Sect.

00:23:50.376 --> 00:23:51.215
I recall you.

00:23:51.655 --> 00:23:53.096
This person seems suspicious.

00:23:53.136 --> 00:23:53.975
Be careful.

00:23:55.695 --> 00:23:56.776
Fellow cultivator,

00:23:59.455 --> 00:24:01.255
(Liuguang Sect)
this is our sect's token.

00:24:01.376 --> 00:24:02.776
Forgive my boldness.

00:24:02.896 --> 00:24:04.975
But do you have proof of identity?

00:24:05.336 --> 00:24:06.376
Of course.

00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:19.336
Sir,

00:24:19.576 --> 00:24:20.896
who are you?

00:24:20.935 --> 00:24:22.175
Why are you here?

00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:23.175
You don't seem to be

00:24:23.175 --> 00:24:24.376
from the Ten Great Sects.

00:24:24.376 --> 00:24:26.096
I was resting under the rock

00:24:26.255 --> 00:24:27.136
when suddenly

00:24:27.136 --> 00:24:28.175
a stone fell from above.

00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.896
It nearly hit me to death.

00:24:30.096 --> 00:24:31.576
You have to help me.

00:24:31.576 --> 00:24:34.336
I feel so dizzy.

00:24:34.336 --> 00:24:36.536
Alright, let me help you up.

00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:39.495
Please rise, sir.

00:24:47.576 --> 00:24:48.695
Sir,

00:24:48.776 --> 00:24:49.735
what are you doing?

00:24:49.735 --> 00:24:51.975
Why are you touching him?

00:24:51.975 --> 00:24:53.136
The scent of the living.

00:24:53.655 --> 00:24:55.136
The scent of the living.

00:24:55.455 --> 00:24:56.856
Too long it's been.

00:24:57.296 --> 00:24:59.616
Too long.

00:25:00.616 --> 00:25:01.695
You three

00:25:01.695 --> 00:25:02.896
not only saved my life

00:25:03.056 --> 00:25:05.376
but also cured my ailment.

00:25:05.536 --> 00:25:06.175
Ailment?

00:25:06.376 --> 00:25:07.376
Longing sickness.

00:25:07.536 --> 00:25:09.576
Longing for the living.

00:25:09.816 --> 00:25:12.776
I've been here a thousand years

00:25:12.816 --> 00:25:16.056
without seeing living souls.

00:25:16.215 --> 00:25:19.015
You claim to have been here
a thousand years?

00:25:19.175 --> 00:25:20.695
Then who exactly are you?

00:25:20.896 --> 00:25:22.415
I am Bo...

00:25:29.415 --> 00:25:31.655
I am the guardian of this secret realm,

00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:33.576
the Realm Spirit.

00:25:35.015 --> 00:25:36.735
The Realm Spirit?

00:25:36.896 --> 00:25:37.975
Any proof?

00:25:44.096 --> 00:25:45.856
The Cloudseeker Tree?

00:25:46.215 --> 00:25:47.735
Everyone, I have matters to attend to.

00:25:47.735 --> 00:25:48.536
I'll take my leave.

00:25:48.896 --> 00:25:50.215
You can't leave.

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:52.296
Why?

00:25:52.576 --> 00:25:53.975
The secret realm's gate only opens

00:25:54.015 --> 00:25:55.336
during odd-numbered days

00:25:55.336 --> 00:25:57.415
after the Hour of Shen.

00:25:57.695 --> 00:25:59.056
You won't leave today.

00:25:59.175 --> 00:26:00.015
Don't believe me?

00:26:00.415 --> 00:26:01.856
Try it then.

00:26:02.495 --> 00:26:04.215
What urgent matter
requires you to leave?

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:05.935
Can't you wait another day?

00:26:07.255 --> 00:26:08.255
Not exactly.

00:26:08.935 --> 00:26:09.735
Good.

00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:11.735
You three

00:26:11.776 --> 00:26:14.336
can keep me company till tomorrow.

00:26:17.056 --> 00:26:18.415
What shall we do to pass the time?

00:26:18.415 --> 00:26:20.616
We truly have urgent matters

00:26:20.616 --> 00:26:21.376
to attend to.

00:26:21.376 --> 00:26:22.175
We need to go to

00:26:22.175 --> 00:26:23.695
Immortal Bo Yuan's residence

00:26:23.856 --> 00:26:25.376
to retrieve the Merfolk Scale.

00:26:25.576 --> 00:26:26.215
By the way,

00:26:26.536 --> 00:26:29.056
since you're the Realm Spirit,

00:26:29.096 --> 00:26:30.616
do you know where the Merfolk Scale

00:26:30.616 --> 00:26:31.856
is currently located?

00:26:31.935 --> 00:26:33.975
You seek the Merfolk Scale?

00:26:33.975 --> 00:26:34.695
Exactly.

00:26:34.776 --> 00:26:35.576
Correct.

00:26:35.735 --> 00:26:38.935
It's indeed hidden
in the immortal's home.

00:26:43.336 --> 00:26:45.616
Huan Zong, you were right.

00:26:45.816 --> 00:26:48.056
The Merfolk Scale is truly here.

00:26:48.776 --> 00:26:49.896
Sir, please

00:26:49.896 --> 00:26:50.616
tell us directly

00:26:50.616 --> 00:26:51.695
where the Merfolk Scale is.

00:26:51.856 --> 00:26:53.536
Why the haste?

00:26:53.896 --> 00:26:55.415
Only when the time comes

00:26:55.415 --> 00:26:56.816
can you leave.

00:26:56.856 --> 00:26:57.856
Then

00:26:58.015 --> 00:27:00.096
I'll tell you its location.

00:27:00.655 --> 00:27:02.495
And you three

00:27:02.655 --> 00:27:04.336
must entertain me.

00:27:04.495 --> 00:27:05.136
Sir,

00:27:05.255 --> 00:27:06.655
we genuinely have important matters

00:27:06.816 --> 00:27:08.215
and no time to spare.

00:27:09.096 --> 00:27:11.816
You were insisting on leaving earlier.

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:12.896
Why do I feel

00:27:12.896 --> 00:27:14.376
you're acting strange?

00:27:14.376 --> 00:27:15.056
I...

00:27:16.056 --> 00:27:16.616
Never mind.

00:27:16.975 --> 00:27:18.616
We'll wait until the Hour of Shen.

00:27:18.776 --> 00:27:19.655
Sir,

00:27:20.136 --> 00:27:21.215
please tell us directly

00:27:21.215 --> 00:27:22.015
where it is.

00:27:22.136 --> 00:27:22.896
If you have

00:27:22.896 --> 00:27:24.015
any tests or challenges,

00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:25.376
just state them outright.

00:27:25.776 --> 00:27:27.536
Indeed, sir.

00:27:27.616 --> 00:27:28.455
Please don't keep us

00:27:28.455 --> 00:27:29.655
in suspense any longer.

00:27:29.695 --> 00:27:31.576
You said it yourselves.

00:27:31.735 --> 00:27:33.175
I can set conditions.

00:27:34.896 --> 00:27:38.136
It's morning. I need breakfast.

00:27:38.296 --> 00:27:40.336
The Realm Spirit needs to eat?

00:27:40.816 --> 00:27:42.536
It's not... I...

00:27:42.695 --> 00:27:45.136
I've never had proper meals.

00:27:45.136 --> 00:27:45.856
Alright?

00:27:49.576 --> 00:27:51.816
It seems you won't cook.

00:27:52.175 --> 00:27:53.735
If you refuse to cook,

00:27:53.896 --> 00:27:55.935
I won't tell you

00:27:56.096 --> 00:27:58.695
where the Merfolk Scale is.

00:28:01.296 --> 00:28:02.096
Huan Zong,

00:28:02.255 --> 00:28:03.255
there's a possibility

00:28:03.255 --> 00:28:04.975
some cultivators practice fasting.

00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:05.776
Like yourself.

00:28:05.816 --> 00:28:06.776
And others

00:28:06.776 --> 00:28:07.536
need regular meals.

00:28:07.576 --> 00:28:08.616
Like me.

00:28:09.255 --> 00:28:10.655
This elder

00:28:10.735 --> 00:28:12.455
may happen to be a Realm Spirit

00:28:12.616 --> 00:28:14.056
that requires sustenance.

00:28:14.816 --> 00:28:15.816
Sir.

00:28:15.975 --> 00:28:16.935
Sir.

00:28:17.816 --> 00:28:18.776
What would you like?

00:28:18.856 --> 00:28:19.655
I'll prepare it.

00:28:32.255 --> 00:28:33.655
What's this?

00:28:35.495 --> 00:28:36.655
Is it edible?

00:28:37.655 --> 00:28:39.455
You live here and yet don't know?

00:28:39.576 --> 00:28:42.136
This is Frostweed.

00:28:42.255 --> 00:28:43.376
In this barren area,

00:28:43.376 --> 00:28:44.975
we can only forage Frostweed.

00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:45.536
However

00:28:45.536 --> 00:28:47.616
it's refreshing and crispy.

00:28:47.735 --> 00:28:49.695
I see.

00:28:49.816 --> 00:28:50.695
Chi Si,

00:28:51.215 --> 00:28:52.376
might I trouble you

00:28:52.376 --> 00:28:53.816
to help prepare these?

00:28:54.056 --> 00:28:55.896
I've heard Liuguang Sect cultivators

00:28:55.896 --> 00:28:57.015
all practice fasting.

00:28:57.136 --> 00:28:58.655
Why do you

00:28:58.655 --> 00:29:00.096
carry provisions?

00:29:02.015 --> 00:29:04.136
Because that silly girl doesn't fast.

00:29:05.655 --> 00:29:06.896
Your bond

00:29:06.896 --> 00:29:08.175
is truly admirable.

00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:13.655
Chi Si,

00:29:14.376 --> 00:29:16.296
I've wanted to ask you something.

00:29:16.616 --> 00:29:18.415
Have you encountered

00:29:18.495 --> 00:29:20.296
any remarkable phenomena in this realm?

00:29:20.495 --> 00:29:22.735
Or met other cultivators?

00:29:23.616 --> 00:29:24.495
I've only

00:29:24.735 --> 00:29:26.816
encountered you and Lady Kong Hou.

00:29:30.455 --> 00:29:31.536
By the way,

00:29:31.896 --> 00:29:33.296
you mentioned needing

00:29:33.455 --> 00:29:35.056
to leave for urgent matters earlier.

00:29:35.215 --> 00:29:36.616
Is there trouble?

00:29:36.776 --> 00:29:38.495
Can I assist?

00:29:40.655 --> 00:29:41.735
Some members of

00:29:41.735 --> 00:29:42.896
the Rogue Cultivator Alliance

00:29:43.096 --> 00:29:44.695
can be quite troublesome.

00:29:45.816 --> 00:29:48.056
I'm concerned.

00:29:48.255 --> 00:29:49.096
(Only three)

00:29:49.096 --> 00:29:50.336
(from the Alliance entered.)

00:29:50.576 --> 00:29:52.255
(He's suspicious.)

00:29:53.776 --> 00:29:55.175
Sir, please try these.

00:29:55.215 --> 00:29:56.616
Shall I explain the dishes?

00:29:56.856 --> 00:29:58.735
First, dried meat stir-fry.

00:29:59.136 --> 00:29:59.935
Good.

00:30:02.015 --> 00:30:03.336
Good.

00:30:07.015 --> 00:30:07.576
Good.

00:30:07.576 --> 00:30:10.015
Second, Frostweed stir-fry.

00:30:10.215 --> 00:30:10.975
Try it.

00:30:20.776 --> 00:30:21.816
Not bad.

00:30:22.376 --> 00:30:24.296
Now for the special dish.

00:30:24.336 --> 00:30:26.215
Can you guess its name?

00:30:26.576 --> 00:30:27.896
Looks familiar.

00:30:27.896 --> 00:30:28.655
No idea.

00:30:28.735 --> 00:30:32.096
Dried meat with Frostweed stir-fry.

00:30:33.776 --> 00:30:35.296
You're truly impressive.

00:30:38.695 --> 00:30:40.215
The meat's chewiness

00:30:40.296 --> 00:30:42.856
paired with Frostweed's freshness

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:44.255
creates a perfect

00:30:44.255 --> 00:30:45.455
harmony, right?

00:30:46.255 --> 00:30:48.136
The meat's richness

00:30:48.215 --> 00:30:50.776
contrasts beautifully

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:53.136
with the Frostweed's crispness.

00:30:53.296 --> 00:30:54.816
Hearing you say that,

00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:57.616
there's actually this lingering taste.

00:30:58.376 --> 00:31:00.576
The more I chew,
the more flavorful it becomes.

00:31:03.255 --> 00:31:04.655
Is it truly this delicious?

00:31:05.896 --> 00:31:07.175
This chance is rare.

00:31:07.495 --> 00:31:08.695
I'll try your cooking.

00:31:17.215 --> 00:31:18.255
Don't spit it out.

00:31:19.655 --> 00:31:21.695
The elder already explained.

00:31:21.735 --> 00:31:22.856
He hasn't eaten

00:31:22.856 --> 00:31:24.015
any proper meals.

00:31:24.175 --> 00:31:25.015
So

00:31:25.096 --> 00:31:26.336
whatever taste I tell him

00:31:26.336 --> 00:31:27.415
is what he'll perceive.

00:31:28.455 --> 00:31:30.096
But this is unbearably salty.

00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:36.015
Sir,

00:31:36.136 --> 00:31:37.175
the meal

00:31:37.175 --> 00:31:38.296
has been consumed.

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:39.975
Shouldn't you now tell us

00:31:39.975 --> 00:31:41.576
where the Merfolk Scale is located?

00:31:41.695 --> 00:31:43.296
When did I promise

00:31:43.296 --> 00:31:45.296
I'd tell you about the Merfolk Scale

00:31:45.415 --> 00:31:47.376
after finishing the meal?

00:31:47.376 --> 00:31:48.015
You...

00:31:48.336 --> 00:31:49.616
How could you do this?

00:31:49.616 --> 00:31:50.856
Going back on your word.

00:31:51.096 --> 00:31:53.975
Full stomachs make me drowsy.

00:31:53.975 --> 00:31:54.856
Young lady,

00:31:55.175 --> 00:31:56.975
you enjoy storybooks, don't you?

00:31:57.136 --> 00:31:58.255
Recite me a tale

00:31:58.255 --> 00:31:59.495
from those storybooks.

00:31:59.655 --> 00:32:03.975
I want pleasant dreams for my nap.

00:32:12.175 --> 00:32:14.896
Quick, start narrating.

00:32:14.935 --> 00:32:17.136
If you refuse,

00:32:17.136 --> 00:32:18.455
I won't disclose

00:32:18.455 --> 00:32:20.896
the Merfolk Scale's location.

00:32:22.695 --> 00:32:23.776
Then what genre

00:32:23.896 --> 00:32:25.896
would you like to hear,

00:32:25.935 --> 00:32:27.655
Immortal Bo Yuan?

00:32:27.776 --> 00:32:31.576
Of course, it's about immortal battles.

00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:36.296
What did you just call me?

00:32:36.576 --> 00:32:38.655
Immortal Bo Yuan.

00:32:38.776 --> 00:32:40.616
I'm the Realm Spirit.

00:32:40.735 --> 00:32:43.056
Immortal Bo Yuan was my master.

00:32:43.136 --> 00:32:44.975
He ascended long ago.

00:32:45.175 --> 00:32:48.296
You're spouting nonsense.

00:32:48.655 --> 00:32:49.576
Never mind.

00:32:49.896 --> 00:32:51.616
I possess a spiritual tool.

00:32:51.695 --> 00:32:53.255
Speak to it,

00:32:53.296 --> 00:32:54.056
and it can tell

00:32:54.175 --> 00:32:56.015
if you're Immortal Bo Yuan.

00:32:58.896 --> 00:33:00.376
Such a treasure exists?

00:33:00.495 --> 00:33:02.415
Liuguang Sect having such a treasure

00:33:02.495 --> 00:33:03.495
isn't surprising.

00:33:03.975 --> 00:33:06.015
Then please speak to it.

00:33:11.296 --> 00:33:12.536
Alright.

00:33:14.336 --> 00:33:16.175
I am Bo Yuan.

00:33:16.415 --> 00:33:18.776
So you are Immortal Bo Yuan.

00:33:19.616 --> 00:33:20.455
Tell me,

00:33:20.735 --> 00:33:22.136
can this treasure

00:33:22.175 --> 00:33:24.255
truly tell my identity?

00:33:24.935 --> 00:33:26.856
It's merely an elixir vial.

00:33:26.975 --> 00:33:28.015
Of course, it can't.

00:33:28.096 --> 00:33:29.935
You tricked me!

00:33:30.056 --> 00:33:31.455
A minor stratagem.

00:33:31.616 --> 00:33:33.056
In your prime,

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:35.015
you wouldn't have been tricked.

00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:36.455
Perhaps prolonged isolation

00:33:36.455 --> 00:33:37.296
in this realm

00:33:37.336 --> 00:33:38.536
has caused...

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:40.616
You mean my abilities have diminished,

00:33:40.616 --> 00:33:41.255
don't you?

00:33:41.296 --> 00:33:42.056
I wouldn't presume.

00:33:42.175 --> 00:33:44.536
Yet you've already implied it.

00:33:44.536 --> 00:33:45.935
How audacious.

00:33:46.455 --> 00:33:47.695
Immortal Bo Yuan,

00:33:47.816 --> 00:33:49.136
the world believes

00:33:49.255 --> 00:33:50.776
you've achieved ascension.

00:33:50.896 --> 00:33:52.415
Why remain here?

00:33:52.536 --> 00:33:53.136
I...

00:33:54.455 --> 00:33:55.215
I...

00:33:57.536 --> 00:33:58.856
I understand now.

00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:01.695
You boasted about ascending

00:34:01.776 --> 00:34:02.896
to the world,

00:34:02.896 --> 00:34:03.616
yet in truth

00:34:03.616 --> 00:34:04.455
you failed

00:34:04.495 --> 00:34:05.935
and now hide

00:34:06.056 --> 00:34:07.175
in this forsaken place.

00:34:07.175 --> 00:34:08.656
No, it's not true.

00:34:08.816 --> 00:34:11.415
Not at all.

00:34:12.176 --> 00:34:14.015
So it's true after all.

00:34:14.095 --> 00:34:15.095
Stop it.

00:34:15.095 --> 00:34:18.256
I beg you, stop.

00:34:18.376 --> 00:34:19.216
Immortal,

00:34:19.336 --> 00:34:20.015
you've likely

00:34:20.015 --> 00:34:21.896
been isolated too long,

00:34:22.535 --> 00:34:23.696
losing deception skills.

00:34:25.256 --> 00:34:27.135
My inadequacy

00:34:27.656 --> 00:34:29.216
caused ascension failure.

00:34:29.296 --> 00:34:30.975
Fearing mockery,

00:34:31.615 --> 00:34:35.336
I secluded myself here.

00:34:36.296 --> 00:34:37.296
The three of you

00:34:37.415 --> 00:34:38.415
must never reveal

00:34:38.415 --> 00:34:40.296
the secret I've hidden here.

00:34:40.615 --> 00:34:41.575
Immortal,

00:34:41.656 --> 00:34:43.216
there's no need to fret.

00:34:43.336 --> 00:34:44.696
Didn't you previously require us

00:34:44.696 --> 00:34:45.896
to meet your conditions

00:34:45.896 --> 00:34:47.495
before giving us the Merfolk Scale?

00:34:47.615 --> 00:34:48.656
And now,

00:34:48.656 --> 00:34:50.615
we'll keep your secret,

00:34:50.776 --> 00:34:52.776
and you give us the Merfolk Scale.

00:34:52.856 --> 00:34:53.376
Deal?

00:34:55.455 --> 00:34:57.176
Can you truly safeguard my secret?

00:34:57.256 --> 00:34:58.095
Absolutely.

00:34:58.256 --> 00:34:59.535
Right, Huan Zong?

00:34:59.896 --> 00:35:01.015
We honor our words.

00:35:03.055 --> 00:35:06.095
Fine. It's a deal.

00:35:11.256 --> 00:35:12.176
Cultivators,

00:35:12.296 --> 00:35:13.656
let's part ways here.

00:35:13.776 --> 00:35:15.055
The Hour of Shen has passed.

00:35:15.176 --> 00:35:16.455
I must depart now

00:35:16.535 --> 00:35:17.776
to meet my Alliance brothers

00:35:17.776 --> 00:35:18.455
and regroup.

00:35:18.656 --> 00:35:19.336
Farewell.

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:26.575
Hold, fellow cultivator.

00:35:29.415 --> 00:35:30.776
In my judgment,

00:35:30.935 --> 00:35:31.736
you'd better travel

00:35:31.736 --> 00:35:32.656
with us.

00:35:34.696 --> 00:35:35.816
What do you mean?

00:35:35.935 --> 00:35:37.256
I mean,

00:35:37.376 --> 00:35:38.615
you're not leaving.

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.415
- Jiusu?
- Jiusu?

00:36:08.296 --> 00:36:09.615
This trick of yours

00:36:09.776 --> 00:36:11.055
is quite formidable.

00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:13.415
It saves me the pretense.

00:36:41.656 --> 00:36:42.415
Stop chasing.

00:36:49.575 --> 00:36:50.135
Zhou Xiao?

00:36:50.135 --> 00:36:50.736
Zhou Xiao?

00:36:50.736 --> 00:36:51.495
Jin Ling?

00:36:52.495 --> 00:36:53.455
How could this happen?

00:36:54.296 --> 00:36:55.615
I have the sect's best medicine.

00:36:55.935 --> 00:36:57.176
Where is it?

00:36:58.575 --> 00:37:00.095
No need. It's too late.

00:37:01.816 --> 00:37:02.575
Lin...

00:37:03.896 --> 00:37:05.135
Lin Hu.

00:37:05.336 --> 00:37:06.015
Yes?

00:37:06.656 --> 00:37:08.615
One final request.

00:37:08.656 --> 00:37:09.336
Speak it.

00:37:09.696 --> 00:37:10.575
Take

00:37:11.856 --> 00:37:14.216
my remains and Jin Ling's

00:37:15.856 --> 00:37:19.216
back to our sect for joint burial.

00:37:20.135 --> 00:37:21.376
Also, please

00:37:22.415 --> 00:37:24.535
ask the Ten Great Sects' leaders

00:37:24.776 --> 00:37:26.296
to arrange

00:37:28.615 --> 00:37:29.816
the Yuanji Sect's

00:37:30.696 --> 00:37:32.696
succession matters.

00:37:32.776 --> 00:37:33.336
Understood.

00:37:34.055 --> 00:37:35.736
I'll ensure it.

00:37:36.015 --> 00:37:38.856
T-Thank you.

00:37:40.975 --> 00:37:42.656
The one who attacked us

00:37:44.015 --> 00:37:46.696
took away

00:37:47.856 --> 00:37:48.975
an

00:37:51.776 --> 00:37:53.095
item...

00:37:54.095 --> 00:37:54.896
What did you say?

00:37:55.135 --> 00:37:55.975
Zhou Xiao?

00:37:56.095 --> 00:37:56.975
Zhou Xiao?

00:37:57.015 --> 00:37:57.816
Zhou Xiao?

00:38:06.696 --> 00:38:07.696
It's Young Master.

00:38:08.656 --> 00:38:09.575
What did he say?

00:38:11.696 --> 00:38:12.816
Chi Si

00:38:13.256 --> 00:38:15.095
was Jiusu in disguise.

00:38:15.656 --> 00:38:16.935
Jiusu?

00:38:18.336 --> 00:38:19.535
Then what was his purpose

00:38:19.535 --> 00:38:20.296
in coming here?

00:38:22.816 --> 00:38:24.256
Zhou Xiao mentioned it.

00:38:24.696 --> 00:38:25.615
I didn't catch it.

00:38:26.615 --> 00:38:28.095
Could it be

00:38:28.216 --> 00:38:29.856
the Dark Cloud Tablet?

00:38:30.575 --> 00:38:32.095
Dark Cloud Tablet?

00:38:32.216 --> 00:38:33.095
Master once told me

00:38:33.095 --> 00:38:34.896
Dark Cloud Tablet
is a top spiritual tool.

00:38:35.015 --> 00:38:36.615
Its exact usage eludes me,

00:38:36.736 --> 00:38:37.455
but

00:38:37.455 --> 00:38:39.336
it's said to harness cosmic forces.

00:38:40.055 --> 00:38:40.736
Could it be...

00:38:43.176 --> 00:38:44.455
