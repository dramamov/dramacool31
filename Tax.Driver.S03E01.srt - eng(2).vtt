00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:21.164
(Lee Je Hoon)

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.065
(Jang Hyuk Jin, Bae Yoo Ram, Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin)

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:37.214
(Taxi Driver 3)

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:39.084
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:40.284
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:41.985
(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:47.955
(Fukuoka)

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:12.985
The show at the castle was good.

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:20.895
His acting is the best.

00:01:49.255 --> 00:01:50.485
Not yet?

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:57.865
Testing, testing. Can everyone hear me?

00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:01.065
Sorry about that. The ships were all backed up.

00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:04.665
Thank you all so much for your patience.

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:10.005
The main event will begin shortly. We have a wide variety of goods,

00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:11.605
so I hope you'll pay close attention.

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:15.745
Hey!

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:19.315
- Get moving! - Hey, get out!

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:21.715
I said, get moving!

00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:27.155
Alright, alright. Make way.

00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:31.025
Good evening, everyone! Thank you!

00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:34.695
Good evening. Can you all hear me? How are we all doing tonight?

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:36.835
Yes, it's a beautiful night, isn't it?

00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:38.935
Not that we can see anything in the dark.

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:40.475
Shall we get right to it?

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:43.205
The format is the same as last time.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:47.815
I'll show items. If you like one, please enter your bid.

00:02:49.575 --> 00:02:51.645
Alright then, shall we begin?

00:02:56.815 --> 00:03:01.395
And we're off! She's 168cm, size 2. This lovely lady is from Russia.

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:06.525
What shall we start the bidding at? Let's start at 5. It's 5.

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:11.235
If you'd like to bid, please turn on your laser pointers.

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:16.435
What do you all think? If you're interested, don't be shy.

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:19.505
You can't pass this one up. Look at this smooth skin,

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:22.115
don't you want a taste? Is that all, everyone?

00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:25.685
She's Russian, everyone. Russian. Take a good look.

00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:27.085
We have 80.

00:03:29.785 --> 00:03:30.855
We have 87.

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:32.285
Are you going to place a bid?

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:33.585
No.

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:35.425
She's not my type.

00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:39.395
She's a beauty! Here, take a look. Anyone else?

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:41.435
She's young and fresh.

00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:43.365
Come on, come on. Let's get those bids higher.

00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:44.805
She's in her prime!

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:49.235
There we go! Do you see that?

00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:51.405
Look at that. We have 100.

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:54.075
I have 100. Anyone else?

00:03:54.175 --> 00:03:55.275
We got 120.

00:03:55.445 --> 00:03:57.085
Any other bids? More than 120.

00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:04.885
Sold! For 12,000 dollars. Thank you.

00:04:05.055 --> 00:04:06.185
Alright, take her away.

00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:51.425
Welcome, you jerks.

00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:34.335
Don't come close.

00:06:53.025 --> 00:06:54.055
Who the hell are you?

00:06:56.295 --> 00:06:57.625
I'm a taxi...

00:06:58.725 --> 00:07:00.125
A taxi driver.

00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:04.535
A taxi driver?

00:07:05.665 --> 00:07:07.235
What's with the smug look then?

00:07:16.345 --> 00:07:23.255
(Taxi Driver 3)

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:37.465
Please, just let me out of here. Please?

00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:30.175
- Come on! Let's go! - Yes, sir.

00:09:48.895 --> 00:09:51.335
- Run for it! - Hey! Come on out!

00:13:15.675 --> 00:13:18.805
(Don't suffer in silence. Call us and we'll take care of it)

00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:35.895
Hello?

00:13:39.395 --> 00:13:41.565
My name is Yun I Seo.

00:13:45.405 --> 00:13:47.235
Please, you have to help me.

00:13:50.475 --> 00:13:52.975
Okay, we're on our way to you.

00:13:54.005 --> 00:13:55.045
Where are you right now?

00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:56.775
There she is. Over there!

00:13:56.915 --> 00:13:57.915
Hey!

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:01.755
Hello?

00:14:02.485 --> 00:14:03.515
Yun I Seo?

00:14:03.785 --> 00:14:05.725
Hello? Yun I Seo? Are you still there?

00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:08.555
Can you hear me?

00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:09.855
Yun I Seo!

00:14:15.595 --> 00:14:19.565
(To save a single life is to save the entire world.)

00:14:52.365 --> 00:14:54.265
Sir, watch out!

00:15:14.795 --> 00:15:15.925
He looks familiar.

00:15:16.495 --> 00:15:18.125
What are you talking about? You're just seeing things.

00:15:18.825 --> 00:15:20.165
- Just my imagination? - Yeah.

00:15:22.435 --> 00:15:27.105
This Hongdongbaekseo and Joyurisi... Where am I supposed to put this?

00:15:27.835 --> 00:15:29.975
Just put it anywhere so we can get started.

00:15:30.035 --> 00:15:32.605
We can't just rush through this. It has to be done with care.

00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:34.105
What if we upset our ancestors?

00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:35.875
Ancestors. Please.

00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:40.345
Go Eun's right. About Joyurisi... It's not an ancient tradition.

00:15:40.585 --> 00:15:42.855
Time's up. Hurry or I'm gone.

00:15:43.055 --> 00:15:44.055
All set.

00:15:46.055 --> 00:15:47.625
This car is gorgeous.

00:15:47.925 --> 00:15:49.055
What about your old car?

00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:51.365
I'm going to sell it. I'll get it all tuned up first.

00:15:52.095 --> 00:15:53.425
Please watch over this car...

00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:57.295
and grant us safe travels wherever we go.

00:15:59.005 --> 00:16:01.605
Well, I have to admit, seeing the new car is pretty nice.

00:16:21.895 --> 00:16:24.155
(Out on Assignment)

00:16:57.695 --> 00:16:59.765
- Straight from the airport? - Yes.

00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:01.635
You should've at least dropped off your luggage first.

00:17:02.035 --> 00:17:05.335
I know. I was in such a rush, it completely slipped my mind.

00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:12.445
- Sorry I'm late. - Hey, glad you're here.

00:17:12.675 --> 00:17:17.015
- You should be a little quicker. - Oh, please. You have no idea.

00:17:17.275 --> 00:17:19.315
How is he supposed to know where his fare is going to get off?

00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:20.685
That's what I mean.

00:17:20.885 --> 00:17:23.915
Driver Kim Do Gi wasn't even late, but I gave him a hard time anyway.

00:17:25.485 --> 00:17:27.225
How was your trip to Japan?

00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:53.145
(Student ID: Yun I Seo)

00:17:54.815 --> 00:17:58.225
We should find out what happened to Yun I Seo.

00:18:00.525 --> 00:18:02.395
I guess I should be the one to go to the school, right?

00:18:03.355 --> 00:18:04.795
Now where did I put my school uniform?

00:18:08.495 --> 00:18:09.495
Wait a minute...

00:18:10.265 --> 00:18:13.365
It'll be easier to question students as a teacher.

00:18:13.935 --> 00:18:14.975
A teacher?

00:18:27.085 --> 00:18:28.115
Hey.

00:18:29.155 --> 00:18:32.325
Break's over, but you're all still out and about.

00:18:35.425 --> 00:18:36.455
Hello.

00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:38.125
Alright.

00:18:38.395 --> 00:18:40.025
(Class 3-3, Homeroom Teacher Hwang In Seong)

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:53.805
You're all such dedicated students, studying even during your break.

00:18:54.075 --> 00:18:56.515
- Who's that? - I don't know.

00:19:01.355 --> 00:19:02.355
Awkward.

00:19:02.415 --> 00:19:04.514
- What was that? - Did he just say "Awkward?"

00:19:04.515 --> 00:19:06.555
- What's that? - My goodness.

00:19:08.055 --> 00:19:09.855
- Study hall? - Did the schedule change?

00:19:10.725 --> 00:19:11.765
Who's the class president?

00:19:12.525 --> 00:19:13.595
That's me?

00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:16.235
Alright.

00:19:16.665 --> 00:19:18.635
Alright, everyone, keep up the hard work.

00:19:19.135 --> 00:19:21.035
I'm rooting for you all.

00:19:23.175 --> 00:19:24.675
Class president, can I have a word with you?

00:19:26.475 --> 00:19:27.475
Hang on a second.

00:19:33.785 --> 00:19:35.815
You know Yun I Seo, right?

00:19:36.615 --> 00:19:38.425
We're in the same class, so I know who she is,

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:40.255
but I don't know her well.

00:19:41.655 --> 00:19:43.695
She hasn't been around school much lately, right?

00:19:45.065 --> 00:19:47.995
She turned in a form saying she was going to some camp.

00:19:49.995 --> 00:19:51.165
I'm sorry, who are you?

00:19:53.265 --> 00:19:54.735
So she went to a camp.

00:19:56.335 --> 00:19:57.335
Where?

00:19:57.635 --> 00:20:00.105
- Japan? - That I wouldn't know.

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:01.575
(Class 3-3, Homeroom Teacher Hwang In Seong)

00:20:02.275 --> 00:20:04.045
By any chance, are you our new assistant homeroom teacher?

00:20:04.115 --> 00:20:05.815
This camp... Is it a real camp?

00:20:07.085 --> 00:20:09.655
Doesn't the school usually sponsor things like that?

00:20:11.725 --> 00:20:15.795
I Seo's family is not well-off, so she gets a special scholarship.

00:20:16.225 --> 00:20:17.495
Maybe the scholarship foundation sent her?

00:20:18.695 --> 00:20:21.965
But why do you keep asking such weird questions?

00:20:27.065 --> 00:20:28.205
Why do you think?

00:20:29.935 --> 00:20:31.875
I'm asking because I'm worried.

00:20:33.845 --> 00:20:35.075
You're the Class President.

00:20:35.545 --> 00:20:37.475
One of your classmates has gone missing,

00:20:40.285 --> 00:20:41.755
and I guess you're not worried at all?

00:20:44.755 --> 00:20:47.425
Your granddaughter looks just like you.

00:20:47.885 --> 00:20:51.125
Really? Well, she didn't get her brains from me,

00:20:51.395 --> 00:20:53.895
but she's an incredibly bright student.

00:20:54.835 --> 00:20:59.435
She and a friend have been studying at a boarding academy, I think.

00:20:59.865 --> 00:21:01.935
Who knew studying could be so much fun?

00:21:04.105 --> 00:21:05.105
A boarding academy?

00:21:07.905 --> 00:21:09.715
- Here you go. - Thank you.

00:21:09.775 --> 00:21:12.085
- I gave you the whole row. - You shouldn't have.

00:21:12.715 --> 00:21:13.885
My goodness.

00:21:14.685 --> 00:21:17.155
- Enjoy! - Yes, thank you.

00:21:17.215 --> 00:21:18.725
- Take care now. - You too.

00:21:23.895 --> 00:21:28.695
(Lens Implant, Cost with insurance: 1,400 dollars)

00:21:40.605 --> 00:21:42.675
- Yes, Mr. Jang. - Hey, Driver Kim.

00:21:43.975 --> 00:21:46.585
I heard her family thinks she's at a boarding academy.

00:21:47.385 --> 00:21:49.015
But she told the school she was going to a camp.

00:21:49.255 --> 00:21:53.385
So she lied to her family and school and left the country ten days ago.

00:21:53.955 --> 00:21:58.095
I'll have to ask Go Eun to check immigration records and CCTV.

00:21:58.525 --> 00:21:59.865
Are you heading back now?

00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:08.135
I'll head back after I meet one more person.

00:22:15.645 --> 00:22:17.515
You have something to tell me, don't you?

00:22:17.575 --> 00:22:18.615
No, I don't.

00:22:20.345 --> 00:22:22.555
I think we have something in common.

00:22:34.835 --> 00:22:36.265
We're both worried about I Seo.

00:22:51.545 --> 00:22:55.555
(Student ID: Yun I Seo)

00:23:00.555 --> 00:23:01.795
It's because of me.

00:23:03.655 --> 00:23:05.895
It's my fault this happened to I Seo.

00:23:10.665 --> 00:23:12.635
Can you tell me...

00:23:13.865 --> 00:23:15.735
what happened?

00:23:15.935 --> 00:23:18.275
(Student ID: Yun I Seo)

00:23:20.805 --> 00:23:21.875
Hey, I Seo.

00:23:24.575 --> 00:23:26.085
This is so much fun.

00:23:26.545 --> 00:23:28.555
- You gotta try this. - What is it?

00:23:28.785 --> 00:23:32.355
I saw it on a webtoon site. You just pick 1 of the 2.

00:23:33.025 --> 00:23:36.425
- I'm not really good at games. - This one's super easy.

00:23:37.195 --> 00:23:41.265
I have to see a teacher. Play for me? I'll be right back.

00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:49.535
(Odd)

00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:50.875
(You've won 5 dollars!)

00:23:52.175 --> 00:23:53.205
I won.

00:23:56.115 --> 00:23:57.275
What a cute cat.

00:24:03.085 --> 00:24:04.715
(50 Dollars)

00:24:05.885 --> 00:24:07.155
Hello?

00:24:08.085 --> 00:24:09.125
Who is it?

00:24:09.455 --> 00:24:12.465
Grandma, I told you about her. She's Ye Ji, the new transfer.

00:24:15.165 --> 00:24:18.365
- What's this for? - You won it for us. Let's split it.

00:24:19.435 --> 00:24:21.065
But I just won a game.

00:24:21.435 --> 00:24:23.235
It feels a little weird getting real money for it.

00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:27.045
- See? It's fun when you win, right? - Yes.

00:24:28.105 --> 00:24:29.315
It is pretty amazing, though.

00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:41.895
50 Dollars a day times 30. That's 1,050 dollars.

00:24:42.955 --> 00:24:44.965
Hey, with this money, my grandma could get eye surgery!

00:24:45.565 --> 00:24:48.795
- Now you can get surgery, Grandma. - Sweetie.

00:24:49.365 --> 00:24:53.565
Don't you worry about me. Your grandma can see just fine.

00:24:54.305 --> 00:24:57.005
- You know that's not true. - Yes! Hey, I won again!

00:24:59.405 --> 00:25:01.105
- See? It really works. Wanna try? - Go on, you try it. Quick.

00:25:01.175 --> 00:25:02.315
Okay, I'll do it.

00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:03.875
Okay.

00:25:05.685 --> 00:25:06.845
From the day...

00:25:07.715 --> 00:25:09.915
she cashed out her points,

00:25:10.455 --> 00:25:13.785
- Hey, I just... - she became desperate for points.

00:25:17.695 --> 00:25:20.025
Between people, there is an island.

00:25:21.225 --> 00:25:22.995
And I long to go to that island.

00:25:25.205 --> 00:25:27.334
The island symbolizes the breakdown...

00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:28.905
of social connection in today's world...

00:25:29.205 --> 00:25:32.605
- and a sense of alienation. - When she won and received points,

00:25:33.645 --> 00:25:35.215
she would feel so relieved.

00:25:35.845 --> 00:25:36.975
(My Points)

00:25:37.045 --> 00:25:39.585
But when she started losing, it would spiral out of control,

00:25:43.155 --> 00:25:44.955
and she couldn't stand the anxiety.

Hey, Ye Ji. Do you know about this? The Advance Points Event?

00:26:17.855 --> 00:26:19.555
Does it just give you points?

00:26:20.485 --> 00:26:23.655
Actually, I already got the points from that event.

00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.425

At least your friend paid up. What about you?

00:27:08.065 --> 00:27:10.305
I'm sorry. I didn't know I had to pay it back.

00:27:10.375 --> 00:27:14.475
You know now. Pay up.

00:27:16.045 --> 00:27:18.785
I don't have any money right now.

00:27:19.415 --> 00:27:20.645
- I'll pay you as fast as I can... - Hey.

I hear you're an orphan on a scholarship, right?

00:27:40.165 --> 00:27:41.165
Huh?

00:27:41.435 --> 00:27:44.405
Think you can keep that scholarship with a gambling debt?

00:27:47.145 --> 00:27:50.245
I'll get a part-time job and pay you all back.

00:27:50.775 --> 00:27:52.084
- She says she'll get a job. - A part-time job?

00:27:52.085 --> 00:27:53.615
How can you pay it back with that?

(Nyan-Nyan Jump Ladder)

00:29:14.125 --> 00:29:15.565
Wow, look at all these games.

00:29:15.965 --> 00:29:19.535
They look like simple little games but designed to make kids bet.

00:29:19.965 --> 00:29:23.975
Kids are glued to their phones now. They're an easy target for crooks.

00:29:25.805 --> 00:29:29.975
That "Advance Points Event" they got? It's actually a loan.

00:29:31.045 --> 00:29:35.455
They split the 300 dollar loan into contracts under 100 dollars.

00:29:35.755 --> 00:29:37.585
Why bother splitting it? Why not just one contract?

00:29:37.655 --> 00:29:41.325
Because current law has no rate caps on loans of 75 dollars or less.

00:29:41.655 --> 00:29:42.855
That's the exact loophole they're exploiting.

00:29:44.055 --> 00:29:46.595
Am I seeing this right? It's 5,000 percent annual interest.

00:29:46.695 --> 00:29:50.034
What? Wait. That's right. It says 5,000 percent.

00:29:50.035 --> 00:29:51.135
How is that even possible?

00:29:51.865 --> 00:29:55.835
A 300-dollar loan ballooned to 1,500 dollars...

00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:57.535

00:29:57.735 --> 00:29:58.805
What is this?

00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:02.315
Service fees, late fees, collection fees.

00:30:03.475 --> 00:30:05.845
What kind of ridiculous charges did they tack on?

00:30:06.345 --> 00:30:09.085
Do you think I Seo and Ye Jin know what kind of contract they signed?

00:30:09.785 --> 00:30:10.855
Either way,

00:30:11.715 --> 00:30:15.225
any loan contract with a minor is illegal anyway.

00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.255
If it's illegal, isn't it void from the start?

00:30:17.855 --> 00:30:19.325
You'd think they'd know that.

00:30:20.325 --> 00:30:21.895
Until someone tells them,

00:30:22.365 --> 00:30:24.135
it won't be easy for them to figure it out.

00:30:24.965 --> 00:30:25.965
Why not?

00:30:27.065 --> 00:30:30.035
Because the fact is, they did gamble.

00:30:33.105 --> 00:30:34.974
- Hold it steady, will you? - Just stay still.

00:30:34.975 --> 00:30:36.245
I'm gonna fall!

00:30:37.645 --> 00:30:38.745
- Goodness. - Boss!

00:30:38.815 --> 00:30:39.985
Hey, go give her a scare.

00:30:40.445 --> 00:30:41.745
Let's see.

00:30:43.585 --> 00:30:46.354
Number one. Y equals two to the minus x power...

00:30:46.355 --> 00:30:47.424
is an exponential function.

00:30:47.425 --> 00:30:50.995
Which is one-half to the x power, so it's an exponential function.

00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:52.825
- So that's a true. - Answer the phone.

00:30:53.225 --> 00:30:54.525
Why won't she answer the phone?

00:30:56.135 --> 00:30:59.835
- Number 2. Y equals log base 5... - Why is it so noisy?

00:31:00.035 --> 00:31:01.234
The exponent x moves forward, so it's x times log base 5 of 2.

00:31:01.235 --> 00:31:02.835
Hey, is that noise headed this way?

00:31:03.305 --> 00:31:04.805
Shouldn't we tell the teacher?

00:31:05.705 --> 00:31:07.075
- So the answer is "false." - This is getting scary.

00:31:08.945 --> 00:31:10.715
Grandma.

00:31:11.715 --> 00:31:12.915
Grandma? Aren't you home?

00:31:13.545 --> 00:31:15.915
Grandma, where are you?

00:31:17.855 --> 00:31:20.055
- Is this the place? - There she is.

00:31:21.655 --> 00:31:24.795
- What? What's going on? - It's raining. Let's hurry inside.

00:31:25.665 --> 00:31:26.725
What is this?

00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:32.305
It's a GPS. I had business here anyway, so this is perfect.

00:31:32.365 --> 00:31:35.265
- Find the cash box. - The cash box? Okay, let's see.

00:31:35.335 --> 00:31:37.375
- Found it. The cash box. - No, don't!

00:31:37.435 --> 00:31:38.435
Let go.

00:31:39.145 --> 00:31:42.244
- I told you to stop! - Out of my way. What's with her?

00:31:42.245 --> 00:31:45.545
- This place is huge. - You really can't do this here.

00:31:45.615 --> 00:31:47.745
- Let go. - I said no!

00:31:49.285 --> 00:31:50.285
Let go of it.

00:31:50.715 --> 00:31:53.985
- Please, just stop it! - Stop what?

00:31:57.025 --> 00:31:58.155
After her, you're next.

00:31:58.655 --> 00:32:00.795
Who do you think you are, not paying us back?

00:32:01.425 --> 00:32:03.365
I'm calling the police.

00:32:05.665 --> 00:32:07.935
The police? Go ahead. Call them!

00:32:08.605 --> 00:32:11.605
- You were gambling, not us. - If you call the cops,

00:32:12.545 --> 00:32:15.345
they'll arrest you, not us.

00:32:16.375 --> 00:32:18.645
He's right.

00:32:18.885 --> 00:32:21.615
Minors who gamble go to juvie, right?

00:32:22.485 --> 00:32:25.085
What are you waiting for? Not calling? Why not?

00:32:25.785 --> 00:32:28.925
- Don't you know the number? - I was wrong.

00:32:29.325 --> 00:32:31.154
- We're sorry. We won't do it again. - I Seo.

00:32:31.155 --> 00:32:32.764
Please, just let us go this once.

00:32:32.765 --> 00:32:36.995
Forget the "please forgive us" crap. Just pay us the money.

00:32:37.095 --> 00:32:38.435
Why can't you get it through your head?

00:32:38.495 --> 00:32:40.805
Please don't call the police.

00:32:41.005 --> 00:32:42.975
Please, don't.

00:32:43.675 --> 00:32:45.135
We'll never do it again.

00:32:46.245 --> 00:32:47.905
We promise it won't happen again.

00:32:48.845 --> 00:32:49.845
Get up.

00:32:50.545 --> 00:32:51.845
I said get up. Now.

00:32:52.915 --> 00:32:54.585
What are you doing? You too, get up.

00:32:55.285 --> 00:32:56.285
Okay.

00:32:57.355 --> 00:32:58.355
Okay.

00:33:03.225 --> 00:33:04.225
All right then.

00:33:06.825 --> 00:33:09.995
Want me to tell you an easy way out?

00:33:12.565 --> 00:33:13.565
Do you?

00:33:35.825 --> 00:33:36.825
I'm...

00:33:38.825 --> 00:33:40.825
I'm going to do what those guys said.

00:33:45.065 --> 00:33:46.205
Hey, Yun I Seo.

00:33:48.665 --> 00:33:50.235
You heard what those guys said.

00:33:51.205 --> 00:33:53.305
If we go to Japan and work for just one month,

00:33:53.405 --> 00:33:55.875
they said they'd wipe out our debt, interest, and all.

00:33:56.215 --> 00:33:57.845
Do you have any idea what kind of job that is?

00:34:00.085 --> 00:34:01.845
If it's dangerous, we can just come back.

00:34:03.455 --> 00:34:06.425
Remember on our school trip? It only took three hours by boat.

00:34:07.685 --> 00:34:08.725
Right?

00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:14.165
This is all my fault.

00:34:20.735 --> 00:34:22.305
I shouldn't have done it.

00:34:25.605 --> 00:34:28.045
I never should've gotten into this in the first place.

00:34:32.145 --> 00:34:34.015
What was I thinking?

00:34:38.155 --> 00:34:39.185
I'm sorry.

00:34:39.925 --> 00:34:41.285
It's all my fault.

00:34:48.525 --> 00:34:49.795
I'm so sorry, I Seo.

00:34:50.935 --> 00:34:52.305
Let's go together...

00:34:52.835 --> 00:34:54.035
and pay it all off.

00:35:34.575 --> 00:35:36.875
- I was leaving with I Seo then... - Ye Ji.

00:35:37.775 --> 00:35:38.775
Dad.

00:35:39.545 --> 00:35:42.044
My dad caught me and took away my phone,

00:35:42.045 --> 00:35:43.955
so I had no way to get in touch with I Seo.

00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:49.925
Come on.

00:35:50.455 --> 00:35:51.755
How long are you gonna keep calling?

00:35:52.325 --> 00:35:54.325
Stop trying to reach someone who's not coming.

00:35:54.725 --> 00:35:55.735
So, what's it gonna be?

00:35:56.035 --> 00:35:57.565
Let's just go already.

00:35:58.865 --> 00:35:59.865
Take it.

00:36:05.275 --> 00:36:06.345
There you go.

00:36:07.645 --> 00:36:09.845
You have to clean up your own mess.

00:36:10.315 --> 00:36:12.785
- Right? - Let's go.

00:36:14.615 --> 00:36:15.955
It's all my fault.

00:36:18.085 --> 00:36:20.125
This happened to I Seo because of me.

00:36:22.225 --> 00:36:24.725
I was too scared to tell anyone.

00:36:26.095 --> 00:36:28.095
Please, find my friend.

00:36:31.335 --> 00:36:33.565
They just started playing a mobile game for fun.

00:36:34.565 --> 00:36:37.435
They never imagined they'd fall into such a deep hole.

00:36:38.075 --> 00:36:40.205
Of course not. How could they have predicted this?

00:36:41.545 --> 00:36:43.875
I Seo didn't just fall into this.

00:36:45.115 --> 00:36:46.685
She was dragged into it.

00:36:47.945 --> 00:36:50.215
A mobile game that's easily accessible to anyone.

00:36:50.985 --> 00:36:54.725
And when a classmate recommends it, you're less likely to suspect it.

00:36:55.995 --> 00:36:58.225
They set a trap right inside that very game...

00:37:00.225 --> 00:37:01.925
and just waited for someone to spring it.

00:37:02.495 --> 00:37:05.295
And they're targeting minors who have no real-world experience.

00:37:05.805 --> 00:37:07.465

It's so much faster now.

00:39:31.615 --> 00:39:33.385
Did they overhaul the entire program?

00:39:33.745 --> 00:39:34.915
All right.

00:39:39.385 --> 00:39:42.485
Driver Kim, I'm sending you a video. Check it out.

00:39:43.225 --> 00:39:45.455
It's footage of the guys who took I Seo at the port.

00:39:45.865 --> 00:39:50.165
- If it's debt, why ship her abroad? - Exactly.

00:39:50.435 --> 00:39:53.835
Debtors are usually harassed to pay. They don't get shipped off to Japan.

00:39:54.165 --> 00:39:57.375
That's one of the things we need to figure out.

00:39:57.505 --> 00:40:01.475
Sending them to Japan must be much more profitable for them.

00:40:08.215 --> 00:40:10.185
The two guys who left the country with I Seo...

00:40:10.655 --> 00:40:12.015
they came right back.

00:40:12.415 --> 00:40:14.625
It's like they dropped I Seo off.

00:40:14.825 --> 00:40:17.255
They could just be couriers.

00:40:20.865 --> 00:40:23.795
If it's all right, can you let me handle it this time?

00:40:26.535 --> 00:40:27.865

Tell us. What is it?

The two punks who took I Seo just came back alone.

00:41:36.005 --> 00:41:39.035
Then shouldn't we grab those two and beat it out of them?

00:41:39.275 --> 00:41:42.475
Go Eun already told us. If we make a rash move,

00:41:42.545 --> 00:41:45.175
we could lose our only lead to find I Seo.

00:41:46.485 --> 00:41:48.785
Seriously? How did I win again?

00:41:50.285 --> 00:41:53.025
I worked so hard to lose all that money.

00:41:53.185 --> 00:41:55.255
And here, everyone else is dying to win.

Sure. You could be debt-free in a month or two. No problem.

I'll do it. I swear I'll work really hard.

Turns out this company, Neko Money, is a franchise.

00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:20.265
All their funds, from the beginning, came from Japan.

00:44:20.635 --> 00:44:24.835
So Japanese money is funding these kids' gambling habits?

00:44:25.205 --> 00:44:27.905
I also checked the game's source code comments.

00:44:27.975 --> 00:44:29.245
It was made in Japan.

00:44:29.945 --> 00:44:33.085
A loan company with Japanese funds.

00:44:33.945 --> 00:44:35.785

00:45:38.745 --> 00:45:40.185
So sorry. Excuse me.

00:45:42.545 --> 00:45:43.555
Remember this.

00:45:44.185 --> 00:45:45.355
You're not in this alone.

You made it.

- You weren't followed, right? - Of course not.

00:46:15.585 --> 00:46:17.585
I'm the one who'd be doomed if I got caught.

Hey, over here.

00:46:32.565 --> 00:46:35.705
Driver's side is on the other side. This must feel weird. You okay?

00:46:35.765 --> 00:46:36.775
Yeah, I'll be fine.

00:46:39.845 --> 00:46:40.845
This feels weird.

00:46:45.175 --> 00:46:46.285
All right, then.

00:46:46.885 --> 00:46:47.915
Everyone, drive safe.

00:46:48.285 --> 00:46:50.915
- Right turn. No, wipers. - All right.

00:47:11.835 --> 00:47:15.505
I wonder why they're turning back right after they got here.

00:47:15.605 --> 00:47:17.545
- Me too. - Because it's a cell network.

00:47:19.045 --> 00:47:20.115
A cell network?

00:47:20.485 --> 00:47:21.745
You mean the kind that's hard to trace?

00:47:21.985 --> 00:47:24.385
After that car drops Go Eun off at her destination,

00:47:24.815 --> 00:47:25.915
it'll disappear too.

00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:28.655
So it's a kind of safety precaution.

00:47:29.125 --> 00:47:33.225
But driving on the other side, it feels really strange.

00:47:33.295 --> 00:47:36.635
I know. It feels like we're on the wrong side. Cars are coming for us.

00:47:39.395 --> 00:47:40.935
We are driving on the wrong side!

00:47:43.405 --> 00:47:45.904

00:47:45.905 --> 00:47:47.345
Come on, hurry up!

00:47:50.945 --> 00:47:52.345
No, you have to change lanes again!

00:47:52.415 --> 00:47:54.945
I'm not used to it, okay! I'm not used to it!

00:47:55.745 --> 00:47:57.155
My body isn't doing what I want it to!

00:47:57.915 --> 00:47:59.155
- This is the right lane, right? - Yes.

00:47:59.315 --> 00:48:01.825
That's right. Follow the arrows. You got it.

00:48:02.025 --> 00:48:03.025
You want me to drive?

00:48:05.355 --> 00:48:06.865
We need to move faster too.

00:49:01.615 --> 00:49:03.715
(Life Reset)

00:49:18.195 --> 00:49:19.295
Nice.

00:49:23.805 --> 00:49:25.105
It's cute.

00:49:32.415 --> 00:49:33.615
(Life Reset)

00:49:36.855 --> 00:49:37.955
Please, come in.

00:49:40.555 --> 00:49:41.555
Go.

00:49:48.765 --> 00:49:49.765
Go Eun?

00:49:51.235 --> 00:49:53.905
- Go Eun! - What? Why did it shut off?

00:49:54.665 --> 00:49:57.735
Something in the building's probably blocking the signal.

00:49:58.735 --> 00:49:59.805
Then what about Go Eun?

00:50:14.725 --> 00:50:16.425
Hey, who the hell are you?

00:50:22.525 --> 00:50:23.535
Hey!

00:50:23.965 --> 00:50:25.865
We're not expecting a delivery today.

00:50:56.265 --> 00:50:57.265
Driver Kim.

00:51:00.005 --> 00:51:01.005
No, it's just...

00:51:01.565 --> 00:51:04.275
They suddenly tried to take all my stuff.

00:51:05.375 --> 00:51:06.375
What do I do?

00:51:07.875 --> 00:51:09.945
It's okay. It's fine.

00:52:03.535 --> 00:52:05.535
You know who this is, don't you? This girl.

00:52:14.205 --> 00:52:15.205
Hey, wait!

00:52:17.845 --> 00:52:18.845
You know who she is, don't you?

00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:20.585
I just...

00:52:20.845 --> 00:52:22.884
I just wipe the traces and identities...

00:52:22.885 --> 00:52:24.585
of the people they send over!

00:52:25.085 --> 00:52:26.625
I don't know what happens after that!

00:52:31.095 --> 00:52:32.555
How do you pay them?

00:52:32.995 --> 00:52:34.565
A car!

00:52:35.565 --> 00:52:37.935
A car always comes to pick up the cash!

00:52:39.195 --> 00:52:41.035
If you check out that car, you'll find what you need.

00:52:41.665 --> 00:52:42.765
That's everything I know!

00:52:43.505 --> 00:52:45.505
He must be talking about the car that dropped me off.

00:52:45.875 --> 00:52:47.075
I got a picture of the license plate.

00:52:49.475 --> 00:52:52.875
You know, Driver Kim is surprisingly good at Japanese.

00:52:53.245 --> 00:52:55.015
And his accent is perfect.

00:52:55.715 --> 00:52:57.415
I've confirmed the location. Sharing it now.

00:52:57.515 --> 00:52:59.415
Hey! You can't just leave me tied up! Hey!

00:52:59.485 --> 00:53:00.525
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:53:30.115 --> 00:53:31.155
- Sir. - Sir.

00:53:38.495 --> 00:53:39.495
- Sir. - Sir.

00:53:59.475 --> 00:54:00.785
Please, help me.

00:54:02.515 --> 00:54:03.555
Who did this to you?

00:54:04.885 --> 00:54:07.755
Please let me go home. Please?

00:54:09.725 --> 00:54:10.725
Who's in charge of this girl?

00:54:11.395 --> 00:54:12.395
I am, sir.

00:54:45.755 --> 00:54:47.325
It's not your fault.

00:54:48.895 --> 00:54:49.895
The punishment...

00:54:50.165 --> 00:54:52.735
is for the one who failed to do their job.

00:54:55.165 --> 00:54:57.075
False hope...

00:54:59.635 --> 00:55:02.005
is nothing but a noose around your neck.

00:55:04.215 --> 00:55:06.675
The longer you hold on to it,

00:55:08.615 --> 00:55:10.485
the tighter it will choke you.

00:55:14.585 --> 00:55:17.195
The sooner you give up,

00:55:18.725 --> 00:55:19.725
the more...

00:55:21.295 --> 00:55:22.795
at peace you'll be.

00:55:39.515 --> 00:55:40.544
Get her dressed.

00:55:40.545 --> 00:55:41.545
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

00:56:12.615 --> 00:56:13.815
What on earth are you guys doing here?

00:56:14.245 --> 00:56:17.985
- What's with the crazy getup? - We're trying to lose weight.

00:56:19.015 --> 00:56:21.955
This is a gym, right?

00:56:27.865 --> 00:56:29.595
Find a butcher shop instead.

00:56:31.565 --> 00:56:32.795
You fat fool.

00:56:37.405 --> 00:56:39.905
Everything they do is so obnoxious.

00:56:40.345 --> 00:56:42.845
You think they are yakuza?

00:56:44.115 --> 00:56:46.145
He doesn't seem like your typical yakuza.

00:56:46.645 --> 00:56:47.945
And how would you know that?

00:56:48.785 --> 00:56:50.315
They don't have a single tattoo.

00:56:50.815 --> 00:56:51.885
Plus, they look young.

00:56:54.155 --> 00:56:56.725
- Still, this place is kinda creepy. - What is?

00:56:57.195 --> 00:57:00.095
They've got all those huge talismans plastered on the entrance.

00:57:00.465 --> 00:57:01.465
Is it haunted or something?

00:57:01.925 --> 00:57:03.935
It says "No Unauthorized Entry."

00:57:04.235 --> 00:57:05.835
Is there anything you don't know, Driver Kim?

00:57:06.365 --> 00:57:07.605
I really thought they were talismans.

00:57:08.005 --> 00:57:09.005
Go Eun?

00:57:09.405 --> 00:57:10.475
Yes, Driver Kim.

00:57:10.875 --> 00:57:15.205
If outsiders aren't allowed in, then who can get us inside?

00:57:15.805 --> 00:57:16.875
Well...

00:57:17.515 --> 00:57:18.545
An insider?

00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:20.645
Bingo!

00:57:21.285 --> 00:57:22.285
I got it.

00:57:23.315 --> 00:57:24.555
But where are we going to find an insider?

00:57:26.115 --> 00:57:27.125
Right there.

00:57:35.025 --> 00:57:36.025
I don't know.

00:57:36.425 --> 00:57:38.535
They don't exactly look like the welcoming type.

00:57:50.205 --> 00:57:51.915
- Let's go. Boss will be here soon. - All right.

00:58:16.465 --> 00:58:17.475
Wipe it off.

00:58:17.805 --> 00:58:18.805
What?

00:58:24.845 --> 00:58:26.345
These are my favourite shoes.

00:58:28.015 --> 00:58:29.315
If you don't want to clean them, it's 500 dollars.

00:58:29.815 --> 00:58:33.285
What? You're the one who stuck your foot out.

00:58:37.025 --> 00:58:38.195
Cut the excuses!

00:58:42.325 --> 00:58:43.325
What's all this commotion?

00:58:46.735 --> 00:58:48.765
This guy just came out of nowhere.

00:58:49.905 --> 00:58:52.375
You too. Cut the excuses!

00:58:53.505 --> 00:58:54.505
Enough!

00:58:55.645 --> 00:58:57.245
Don't cause a scene out here.

00:58:57.815 --> 00:58:59.075
Bring that jerk upstairs.

00:58:59.815 --> 00:59:01.985
If you're going to run, now's your chance.

00:59:03.645 --> 00:59:04.685
Now that...

00:59:05.585 --> 00:59:06.615
is a very original excuse.

00:59:07.055 --> 00:59:09.655
- Drag that jerk upstairs, now! - Yes, sir!

00:59:15.195 --> 00:59:16.195
I'll go myself.

00:59:18.035 --> 00:59:19.135
Gosh, I wanna be like him.

00:59:19.495 --> 00:59:20.505
He's amazing.

00:59:25.305 --> 00:59:28.875
If I go on a diet... He took them out in five seconds.

00:59:29.205 --> 00:59:30.515
More like three seconds.

00:59:34.185 --> 00:59:37.515
We don't go easy on people who cause trouble in our territory.

00:59:38.315 --> 00:59:40.655
And who exactly is it that won't go easy on me?

00:59:40.955 --> 00:59:42.125
Because it sure doesn't look like it's you.

00:59:43.995 --> 00:59:44.995
Where's your boss?

00:59:45.095 --> 00:59:46.155
- What? - Goodness.

00:59:46.225 --> 00:59:48.595
You think our boss would bother meeting a punk like you?

00:59:51.065 --> 00:59:52.795
I guess you don't get to see him much either, right?

00:59:58.435 --> 00:59:59.435
Kageyama!

01:00:06.045 --> 01:00:08.085
Today's his big debut,

01:00:08.915 --> 01:00:10.485
and you're the perfect warm-up.

01:00:11.155 --> 01:00:12.155
Five minutes.

01:00:12.955 --> 01:00:14.355
Last five minutes,

01:00:14.585 --> 01:00:16.655
you get a new pair of those precious shoes of yours.

01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:18.925
If you don't,

01:00:19.495 --> 01:00:23.365
you'll spend the rest of your life in a hospital bed.

01:00:34.105 --> 01:00:36.045
Looks like you're raring to go. You're not scared?

01:00:52.995 --> 01:00:54.565
Why so cold, guys?

01:01:44.045 --> 01:01:46.845
Driver Kim will be all right, won't he?

01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:55.585
What? Is it going to end this easily?

01:03:08.965 --> 01:03:10.395
Stop it! Stop!

01:03:29.745 --> 01:03:30.755
That idiot!

01:03:49.405 --> 01:03:50.835
It got dirty.

01:04:00.645 --> 01:04:03.885
But at the end of the day, what completes the look...

01:04:05.215 --> 01:04:06.215
is the face.

01:04:22.835 --> 01:04:24.675
Tell your boss.

01:04:26.005 --> 01:04:27.275
To buy me new shoes,

01:04:28.605 --> 01:04:29.875
and when he does,

01:04:34.645 --> 01:04:35.845
have him call me here.

01:05:11.015 --> 01:05:12.015
My deepest apologies.

01:05:12.755 --> 01:05:14.525
Some psycho suddenly went on a rampage,

01:05:14.785 --> 01:05:16.255
so we were unable to select the bodyguards.

01:05:18.425 --> 01:05:20.355
He's the one who tore up the gym.

01:05:20.965 --> 01:05:21.965
And why?

01:05:23.525 --> 01:05:25.265
He claimed someone spat on his shoes.

01:05:40.115 --> 01:05:41.945
Tell your boss.

01:05:43.745 --> 01:05:44.985
To buy me new shoes,

01:05:46.815 --> 01:05:48.085
and when he does,

01:05:53.925 --> 01:05:55.225
have him call me here.
