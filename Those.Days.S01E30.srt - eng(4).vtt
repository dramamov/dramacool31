"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

=Episode 30=

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.279
Your order is about to expire.

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:22.039
Hello?

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.199
Don't be impatient. I'll be there soon.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.399
Say, don't you think our son

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:35.960
is a business genius?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.759
He just did a live stream,

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:39.360
and he sold out all 100

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.679
of our lunch boxes.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:41.759
Stop gloating already.

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:43.679
If your son is that capable,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.039
if he's that talented,
you should tell him to come back

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.240
and inherit your business.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.440
This way, we won't need to work so hard.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.479
What kind of joke is that?

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.479
My son will study in
a prestigious university.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.310
How can you consider this
a family business?

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.520
The scale is too small.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.919
You have received a new order.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.360
Hurry and switch it off.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.679
I'm already out of pork chops.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.839
What?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.950
Class is in session.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.760
Stand up.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.240
- Shen!
- Shen!

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.159
Thank you, everyone.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.679
Thank you, everyone.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:21.879
Let me say this.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.439
Dear top students,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.350
please don't forget to hold
your celebration at Shen's Restaurant

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.800
when you make it in the future.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.879
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.200
I'll wait for you all
at the prestigious universities.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.060
- Alright.
- Alright. We'll wait for you too.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.320
We'll wait for you too.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.879
Excellent!

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.950
Remember to give us a discount.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.279
This is for you.

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.119
- I want one too!
- I want one too!

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.599
Please keep a low profile.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.520
Hold your celebration
at Shen's Restaurant,

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.080
and each of you will get one.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.360
- I want one too!
- I want one too!

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.250
Will you give us a discount?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.279
Mingzhu.

00:02:58.279 --> 00:02:58.999
Where are you going?

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.080
Great. Keep Mom company this afternoon.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.200
I need to head to Lijun.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.080
But why?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.550
To take back my money.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.599
Dad topped up 100,000 yuan
in my card before this.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.260
And, I quit without
taking my commission.

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:11.250
I'll try to ask for it.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.520
You quit a long time ago.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.640
Can you even get it back?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.920
I should at least give it a try.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.360
Youngsters should try everything.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:18.279
That's what Dad said.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.719
Go now.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.320
See you.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.640
Your commission?

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.599
Meiqi, I'm being honest here.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.839
I rarely encounter a situation as such.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.480
I can only help you

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.119
inquire about it from the HR Department.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360
Thank you, Samantha.

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:42.999
Sorry for the trouble.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.119
How have you been lately?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.839
Terrible.

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.559
A lot has happened at home.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.119
It's a total mess. It's terrible.

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.040
Sorry, Samantha.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.480
I didn't cherish this job before this.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.679
Back then,

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.360
I thought it was boring to go to work.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.660
It was even more boring
when I had to hit the stupid KPI.

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:16.960
But now that I think about it,

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.239
I think I led
a pampered life before this.

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:24.440
Meiqi.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.640
It feels like you've matured a lot.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.919
I think so too.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.760
I also want to ask you this.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.150
Does the Marketing Department
still need manpower?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.359
Can you give me another chance?

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:40.440
I'll surely do my best.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.359
No, we can't.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.120
We already hired someone new.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.420
If so, can you consider me
if there's a vacant position

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.260
that you think it's suitable for me?

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.359
Sure.

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.839
Thank you.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.640
Song.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.839
Mr. Wu.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.340
Have you finished the recruitment
proposal I asked you to prepare?

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:11.000
Yeah.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.039
Show it to me in my office.

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:12.599
Okay.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.100
(Superior)

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:23.799
Hello?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.450
Is the result for the selection out?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.680
Wu was selected.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.159
Didn't I tell you already?

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.110
The result was determined internally.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.120
My foot.

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.130
My friend already told me about it.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.479
Your overall evaluation score
was the highest, right?

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.120
So, you found out, huh?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.479
Why are you asking me, then?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.599
Zhang Hao, listen.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.399
The only reason you weren't selected

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.839
was because your superiors

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.100
thought you were too laid-back.

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.680
A HOD has to lead the pack
and charge ahead.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.960
I'm sure you would've been selected

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.680
if you were more proactive.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.430
Can you please stop
jumping to conclusions?

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.839
What's the point of telling me off

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.810
after the selection?

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.320
When I said I wanted
to participate in the selection,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.039
someone patted their chest

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.640
and assured that she could help me out.

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:12.359
But now, the only one who could help me

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:14.039
is trying to blame me for everything.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.960
Zhang Hao,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.599
what did you mean by that?

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:19.719
This family isn't mine alone.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.919
What's the point of me
striving to be better alone?

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:22.560
Fine!

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.880
The family isn't yours alone.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.000
It's my fault.

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.080
Ms. Xu Zhixia,

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:29.760
lying flat is the only thing I know.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.839
And, it's the only thing I'm best at.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:32.799
I was already lying flat
on the first day you knew me.

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:34.799
Now, I'm going
to prepare for that, okay?

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.479
Zhang Hao!

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.580
(Congratulations. Wu Yuhui has been
appointed as the HR Department HOD)

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.159
Mom.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.760
Did you argue with Dad?

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.760
That's not true.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.640
If so, why are you sleeping with me?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.359
It's because you're my baby girl.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.320
But I have no space to sleep.

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:21.680
Is that so?

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.560
Your bed is huge.
How could there be no space?

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:27.039
I think I have no space.

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.799
Jiao,

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.120
when you grow up,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.599
you'll get married too.

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:37.919
And, you'll have your own children.

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.640
By then, you won't get the chance
to sleep beside me again.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.359
Therefore, you have
to cherish this opportunity, okay?

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:46.080
Mom,

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:48.839
will you get a divorce from Dad?

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:51.080
No.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.880
No, I won't.

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:54.680
If so, you should return to your room.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.719
I need my own space.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.359
If not, I won't have my personal space

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.520
after I get married
and have children in the future.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.880
No, Jiao.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.359
Listen.

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:08.880
No matter when it is,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.560
we women can lead our own lives.

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:12.399
We can have our own space.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.640
Mom, do you have your own space?

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.279
You should hurry and sleep.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.520
I'll have my own space
when you're asleep.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.120
Go to sleep.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.999
I know I'm lying flat.

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:46.280
It's my fault.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.040
It's my fault.

00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:52.519
I hate myself.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.479
I hate myself for not being able
to buy a bigger house.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.359
I don't have anywhere else to go
after arguing with you.

00:08:58.359 --> 00:09:00.800
Secondly, I hate myself
for being a bad example for Jiao.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.750
Do you know how old she is?

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.160
She actually believed

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:07.359
that marriage was the end of self.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.519
What about the third point?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.040
Thirdly, I hate myself for being too old

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.950
to get another husband
without any consequences.

00:09:17.359 --> 00:09:17.960
Wait.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.040
Let's eat.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.160
Mom made that for me.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.280
You're not allowed to eat it.

00:09:25.479 --> 00:09:26.639
Fine. You can have it all.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.800
Mom, you're back.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.440
The marketplace was so crowded today.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:33.960
Yeah, right?

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.960
I was thinking that you guys

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.960
would be sending Jiao
to her piano lessons by now.

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:39.879
And, I was passing by.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.670
That's why I'm here
to deliver some things to you two.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.320
Mom,

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:44.280
Jiao is having online lessons now.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.320
Now, we can take a nap on weekends.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.960
Have you taken lunch?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.879
Why don't you join us?

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:50.879
Zhang Hao.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.200
Zhang Hao!

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.430
Didn't you borrow money from me because

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.800
you needed to pay for
Jiao's piano lessons?

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.080
Zhang Hao.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.719
Don't tell me you couldn't even afford
to pay half of her piano fees.

00:10:08.719 --> 00:10:09.950
Did you actually borrow money from Mom?

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.599
Where did all your money go?

00:10:12.599 --> 00:10:13.910
What did you spend your money on?

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.400
Zhang Hao, listen up.

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:20.160
You own a family.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.770
You mustn't stray from the right path.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.320
That's not it.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.280
Mom.

00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:29.960
I didn't know Zhang Hao
borrowed the money from you.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.400
I lent the money to my sister.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.960
Her mother-in-law
had a brain hemorrhage.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.950
She's in the ER as we speak.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.440
I used it to help her sister.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.950
I helped her sister.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.400
What did you tell me?

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.960
Didn't you say the money
was meant for a specific purpose?

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.560
You lied to me!

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.040
It was urgent.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.200
So what?

00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:51.320
Zhixia,

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:54.719
I know you're
the eldest child of the family.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.560
But your siblings

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.479
have all grown up.

00:10:58.839 --> 00:10:59.440
Am I right?

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.839
You own a family as well.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.770
Shouldn't there be a limit

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.599
when it comes to helping
your maternal family?

00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:06.400
She understands.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.839
What? I haven't finished my words yet!

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:09.300
Yeah, there should be a limit to it.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:09.759
Mom,

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:12.040
they needed the money
to save her mother-in-law.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.280
You're our daughter-in-law now.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.800
My sister was helping
her mother-in-law out.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.610
She's a role model
for all daughters-in-law.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.080
You got me.

00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:22.440
Fine.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.960
I'll say this now.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.759
If, one day,

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:26.519
I'm in the ICU...

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:27.080
Hey.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.160
Do not save me!

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.440
Do not borrow money to save me!

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.080
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.560
I cannot fulfill your request.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.320
Perhaps I'm not suitable

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.950
to be the daughter-in-law
of the Zhang family.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.639
Zhang Hao, we...

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.320
Why don't we get a divorce?

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.560
Zhixia, what are you doing?

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.479
Why did you say that?

00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:44.440
What divorce?

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.639
You're pregnant, you know?

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.440
How can I get a divorce from you?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.599
Yeah. According to the law,

00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:50.119
you cannot get a divorce from me
since I'm pregnant.

00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:51.999
But I can get a divorce from you.

00:11:51.999 --> 00:11:53.320
Hey, you...

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.999
Mom.

00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:14.879
Meiqi.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.639
They reduced
the Mannitol dosage for Mom today.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.280
It seems her condition
has gotten better.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:19.999
Really?

00:12:22.239 --> 00:12:22.839
Mingzhu.

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:25.150
Here's your pork rib soup.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.200
I was planning to take it anyway.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.400
Mom shouldn't have done so.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.320
She shouldn't ask you to deliver it
when you're busy with your studies.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.160
No problem. It's a piece of cake.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.759
Thank you, Minghui.

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:35.359
You should thank Mingzhu.

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.080
I only did it for her sake.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.599
You can shut up now.

00:12:41.479 --> 00:12:42.119
Meiqi,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.960
go and heat this lunch box.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.359
Feed her some soup when she wakes up.

00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:45.879
Okay.

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:53.440
Help me see

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.080
if it's the adult diaper seller.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.639
Okay.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.040
Who is it?

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:06.599
Mingzhu, who is this?

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:08.680
(Shen Mingzhu.)

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.560
(I'll go to your house tonight.)

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:13.200
(We need to talk things through
regarding the inheritance.)

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.950
Mingzhu, whose inheritance
are you guys talking about?

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.280
Don't tell Feng Meiqi about this.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.280
But why?

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.879
Just don't tell her. Don't ask me why.

00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:27.759
If you don't tell me why,

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:28.960
I'll ask Feng Meiqi right now.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.920
Come back!

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.839
My father-in-law had
an illegitimate son.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.119
His mom wants to
discuss this with us.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.639
Mingzhu,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.839
what kind of family have you joined?

00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:46.359
Are you free later?

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:47.920
I'm free.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.200
If so, I'll assign you a task.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.359
Keep an eye on Meiqi for me.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:52.960
Don't let her go home.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.759
Got it?

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.280
My mother-in-law fainted

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.280
because of that woman.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.230
I'm worried that Meiqi
might not be able to take it.

00:13:58.839 --> 00:13:59.560
Got it.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.519
Keep a close eye on her.

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:12.440
Got it.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.400
Minghui.

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:20.839
Here. Someone in
the pantry gave this to me.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.759
Just take it.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.820
(Nanzhou New District People's Court,
Sealed Off)

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.680
You're back.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.040
How did you manage to come here?

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.160
The security guard let me in.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.080
I said I was a good friend of Mr. Feng.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.960
You shouldn't introduce yourself
to the people here.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.320
We know everyone here.

00:15:02.719 --> 00:15:04.359
Even if you aren't embarrassed, we are.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.390
You're still worried about that
when your house is already sealed off?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.210
Where are you going?

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:19.639
Why are you still here?

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:20.570
The sun has already set.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.610
Mingzhu was afraid
that you couldn't cope here.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.920
She told me to keep you company.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.920
I can't cope with the situation
with you around.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.920
You should head back.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.950
Don't you have school tomorrow?

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:30.080
Don't bring that up.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.040
I'm just like you.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.250
I don't want to see Hu Gang either.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.080
If you're staying,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.239
look after my mom for me.

00:15:38.239 --> 00:15:39.310
I need to head back and take a bath.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.719
No. You mustn't leave.

00:15:40.719 --> 00:15:41.359
But why?

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:43.479
If you leave now,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.440
I cannot face Mingzhu

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.400
if something happens to your mom.

00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:53.239
What?

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:55.560
Be honest with me.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.719
Is something going on at my house?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.040
No. Don't worry about it.

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:02.359
Tell me.

00:16:02.599 --> 00:16:03.320
I'm serious.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.960
Tell me!

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
Don't tell her that I told you.

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.719
You won't get a share of this house.

00:16:14.479 --> 00:16:15.479
It's under my name.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.080
You already
saw the opposite unit yourself.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.479
It's already sealed off.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:20.999
The factory has been seized as well.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.119
We'll repay the bank first and
the debtors after we auction it off.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.599
My mother-in-law is currently
hospitalized with a brain hemorrhage.

00:16:28.479 --> 00:16:29.920
We need a lot of money.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.599
We've already borrowed money
from everyone we know.

00:16:33.999 --> 00:16:36.479
I tremble whenever
I hear my phone ringing.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.400
I'm worried that the hospital
might deliver bad news to us.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.879
It's either that or they'll urge us
to pay the hospital bill.

00:16:44.719 --> 00:16:45.800
My mother-in-law fainted

00:16:46.719 --> 00:16:47.920
all because of you.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.310
Let me interrupt you for a second.

00:16:50.239 --> 00:16:52.839
Wasn't it because of your father-in-law?

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.239
It takes two to tango, you know?

00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:56.920
Everyone is responsible for this.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.200
I've been together with Feng
for many years.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.479
I never requested him
to get a divorce at all.

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:02.920
Don't you think I'm a kind mistress?

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.920
How dare you say that?

00:17:05.999 --> 00:17:07.279
Why are you looking for me, then?

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.920
You're still here for the money.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.319
It's not for me.

00:17:11.279 --> 00:17:13.120
It's for Feng's son.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.960
Logically speaking,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.960
we should get a cut
of Feng's inheritance.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.640
Don't tell me things like

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.600
the house and the factory are seized.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.960
That has nothing to do with me.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.250
I'm only concerned about
the things that are related to me.

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.600
I know that Feng bought
a life insurance policy.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.600
Don't even think about it.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.440
You're still healthy.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.020
My mother-in-law
is lying in the hospital.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.719
We have to pay
all kinds of medical bills.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.559
And, her treatments will
require a lot of money as well.

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:37.920
Is it that serious?

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.319
I think Mrs. Feng was too pampered.

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:41.950
That's why she couldn't
endure any hardships.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.640
I would've crawled out

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.039
from the hospital bed had I known

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:45.640
the medical bills would be that high.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.840
How could you say something like that
at such a moment?

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.600
Why not take us to court, then?

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:56.640
We've received plenty
of summons already anyway.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:57.950
Having one more doesn't matter.

00:18:02.719 --> 00:18:03.600
Listen.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.360
You'd better not challenge me.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.479
Hey.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.880
How could you be this shameless?

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.999
What's wrong with you?

00:18:10.999 --> 00:18:12.479
My mom almost died because of you.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.519
Why did you bring her back?

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.160
Scram.

00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:19.319
Scram!

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.079
Do you have a death wish?

00:18:26.079 --> 00:18:26.479
Meiqi!

00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:27.950
- What are you doing?
- You want to die, huh?

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.079
Meiqi!

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:30.239
Listen up! You'd better let go!

00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:30.999
I'll beat you to death!

00:18:30.999 --> 00:18:31.999
Stop it!

00:18:31.999 --> 00:18:33.479
Stop fighting!

00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:35.999
Stop fighting!

00:18:35.999 --> 00:18:36.519
Get out of the way!

00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:37.079
Stop!

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.640
Stop fighting!

00:18:39.479 --> 00:18:40.440
Stop fighting!

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:41.680
If not, I'll call the cops!

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.600
Stop it!

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.799
Just you guys wait.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.840
I won't let you guys off!

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.039
Scram!

00:19:04.719 --> 00:19:05.479
Shen Minghui,

00:19:06.239 --> 00:19:07.239
tell me what's going on.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.440
Meiqi insisted on
coming back for a bath.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.600
It's not Minghui's fault.

00:19:10.999 --> 00:19:12.660
I came back to chase the mistress away.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.920
Why didn't you tell me
that Ding Hong was coming?

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.440
How dare she try to steal
our inheritance?

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.360
She doesn't deserve it!

00:19:17.719 --> 00:19:19.360
There's no more inheritance left anyway!

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.799
She's the reason
our family is in a mess!

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:21.719
Are you sure it was her fault?

00:19:21.719 --> 00:19:23.479
Or was it your dad's fault?

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:27.799
Mom is all alone in the hospital!

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:28.799
How could you come back?

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.479
I hired Mrs. Wang,
the caretaker of the next ward

00:19:34.479 --> 00:19:35.400
to look after her.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.360
Who's paying for it?

00:19:43.239 --> 00:19:44.079
Go and take a bath.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.160
Hurry and return to
the hospital after that!

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.519
Mingzhu, it's my fault.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.960
Can't you even keep an eye on her?

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:04.279
Do you think this mess
isn't big enough for us?

00:20:04.719 --> 00:20:05.999
I just think that...

00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:07.719
I'm sorry.

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:08.600
Scram!

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:15.840
Come back.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:32.999
Go home.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.200
She was brutal.

00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:14.920
Jiao,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.640
what are you doing?

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.200
I'm squeezing toothpaste for you two.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.840
You and Dad slept late last night.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.360
You guys should sleep longer.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.120
We're grown-ups.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.479
We can do this by ourselves.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.479
Okay.

00:22:30.519 --> 00:22:31.999
I'll go and wake Dad, then.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.319
Lazy bug, time to wake up.

00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:40.079
Lazy bug, time to wake up.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440
Wake up!

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.079
I can't hear you.

00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:44.160
Wake up!

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.120
That's ticklish!

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:46.799
Stop it!

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.239
Dad, hurry and wake up.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.600
Mom has already filled up
your toothbrush cup.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.950
She also put toothpaste
on your toothbrush.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.519
Really?

00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:01.039
That's amazing.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.160
Thank you.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.279
Jiao did it.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.239
Jiao has become sensible.

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:24.920
I don't want my daughter
to be so sensible.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.999
When a child is this sensible,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.999
it means the family is in trouble.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:51.600
Mom,

00:23:51.719 --> 00:23:53.200
I'll heat the milk for you.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.200
Miss Shen,

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.680
Dr. Wang has a message for you.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.519
Right now is the golden period
for your mom's recovery.

00:24:04.519 --> 00:24:06.039
Rehabilitation training is required.

00:24:06.719 --> 00:24:08.319
But it'll be quite expensive.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.719
We hope you can consider it.

00:24:10.719 --> 00:24:11.279
Okay.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.640
Contact us anytime if you need anything.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.200
Okay.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:33.799
Goodbye.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.360
Hello, Mingzhu.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.680
Hello, Ni.

00:24:44.719 --> 00:24:45.960
How is your mother-in-law doing?

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.719
Not too good.

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:49.759
She's still bedridden.

00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:51.880
You sound so listless.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.799
Are you still at the hospital?

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:53.950
Why don't I go and visit you?

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.759
Don't.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.950
You shouldn't come to a hospital
when you're healthy.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.840
I want to borrow some money from you.

00:25:01.999 --> 00:25:03.920
Sure. How much do you need?

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.440
Is 50,000 yuan enough?

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.799
That's more than enough.

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:08.480
Sure.
I'll transfer it to you immediately.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:10.239
Thank you so much.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.150
No problem.
Why are you being courteous with me?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.880
I'll hang up now.

00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:19.400
Qi, let's go.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.719
Mom still needs rehabilitation training.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.960
There's a golden recovery period
for brain damage.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.239
There's no second chance.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.680
I know that too.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.559
But, where can we find the money?

00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:40.279
I'll do something about it.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.460
Go and get an appointment
with a specialist later.

00:25:42.479 --> 00:25:43.950
It's hard to get an appointment
in that department.

00:25:44.479 --> 00:25:45.079
Okay.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:48.840
Mingzhu,

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:51.559
without you,

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.640
our family would've been shattered.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.360
I'm here, aren't I?

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.279
Your nephew is here too.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.880
Our family has already hit rock bottom.

00:26:05.719 --> 00:26:08.279
From now on,
everything will only get better.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:14.920
Meiqi, feel it.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.079
My baby is kicking me again.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.120
Mingzhu.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.719
Zhang.

00:26:31.999 --> 00:26:32.719
Where's Mr. Zhao?

00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:34.250
Mr. Zhao is having a meeting upstairs.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.920
I'll wait for him, then.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.719
Have you guys been busy lately?

00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:39.559
Business is dropping.

00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:41.279
What about the F&B Department?

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.559
They're not doing well either.
We don't have walk-in customers.

00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:45.950
We have to depend on the clients
you introduced to us before.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.519
Mr. Zhao.

00:26:50.719 --> 00:26:51.360
Mingzhu.

00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:52.680
What brings you here?

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.600
I came here to send my regards.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.799
My mother-in-law is recovering well.

00:26:56.799 --> 00:26:58.570
I'll come back to work
once she's discharged.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.479
It's fine.

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:02.999
You don't get paid much
for working anyway.

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:04.559
You should rest more.

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:06.750
I have something else to do.
I'll resume my work first.

00:27:07.479 --> 00:27:08.519
Keep this with you.

00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:09.039
Okay.

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:17.319
Hello, Zhixia.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.110
I returned to the hotel
to sign off on my leave.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.450
I realize that our business
has been affected significantly.

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:23.680
What about the sales
of Rufeng Liquor on your side?

00:27:23.999 --> 00:27:25.200
It was okay at first.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.650
But now, we're doing poorly as well.

00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:29.920
There's an issue
with Nanxi Hotel's management.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.680
I heard that there would be a layoff.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.719
A layoff?

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.319
It won't affect me, right?

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.400
I have to depend on this job
to support my child.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.279
That won't be. You're pregnant.

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.880
Your boss can't do anything to you.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.999
You should work there for now.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.999
You can think about it
after your child is born.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.950
You're already looking for
a better option, aren't you?

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.799
How is your mother-in-law doing?

00:27:52.239 --> 00:27:53.190
She's much better now.

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:54.920
She'll be discharged soon.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.920
I'm glad to hear that.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.519
Alright, then. I'll hang up now.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:01.200
I still have things to do.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.279
Okay. Call me anytime

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:04.719
if you need anything.

00:28:04.719 --> 00:28:05.239
Okay.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.079
Goodbye.

00:28:11.319 --> 00:28:12.360
What are you looking at?

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.440
I want to look for a better option too.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.960
Go ahead, then.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.279
You think you're that capable?

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.850
You should be grateful that you can work for
a pregnant boss like me.

00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:25.950
What are you looking for?

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.039
Let me help you out.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.290
We're looking for a better option.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.239
Look at what I've brought you.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.200
It's snow fungus soup.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.519
Mom made it for you specifically.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.080
It nourishes your skin
and relieves liver heatiness.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.160
You're saying that I have
a short tantrum, aren't you?

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.920
Maodou, do you want some?

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.400
My liver isn't that heaty.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.239
See you.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.430
Are you going
to look for a better option?

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.920
My current option is pretty good too.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.360
It's great that she has left.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.999
This way, you can have it all.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.680
Have a try.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.239
I'm deeply honored
that she's caring for me.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.680
But I'm not drinking it.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.250
I'm not good enough
to be your family's daughter-in-law.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.279
Why don't I be
your family's son-in-law, then?

00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:25.920
Have a try.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.680
I know that pregnant women
shouldn't consume too much sugar.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.660
I've reduced the amount of rock sugar.

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:38.440
Didn't your mom make it?

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.039
My mom always does it
with less sugar.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.160
You have to cook it longer next time.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.519
It's not thick enough.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.260
I cooked it for over an hour, you know?

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.400
I mean, my mom cooked it.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.420
My mom wants to buy some clothes
for our unborn baby.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.719
What color do you like?

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.759
My family already has heavy burdens.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.850
I dare not request anything
from you or your mom.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.559
I'll tell you off if you say that again.

00:30:12.079 --> 00:30:13.640
What did you mean by that?

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.799
How can people like us

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:18.600
repent for our mistakes if you dare not
request anything from us?

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.239
You...

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.400
Please forgive me.
Please don't be angry.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.920
I prefer pale yellow.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.880
It's suitable for both genders.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.559
I think my mom
bought the same color too.

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:30.950
We'll have a full set
if you buy the same.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.360
Pale yellow, huh? Alright.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.300
I need to return
the green ones I bought, then.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.150
I suppose pale yellow
suits our baby better.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.039
I mean, my mom.

00:30:42.519 --> 00:30:43.519
Your room is pretty hot.

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:44.020
(8 A.M. on the 30th, Pregnancy Checkup)

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.020
I have a pregnancy checkup tomorrow.

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:49.960
At 8 A.M.?

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.640
If so, we have to leave at 7:15 A.M.

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:54.039
And, you have to fast
for tomorrow's blood test as well.

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:55.039
That means you can't take breakfast.

00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:56.239
I'll deliver breakfast to you, then.

00:30:56.239 --> 00:30:57.250
Is porridge okay with you?

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.750
Alright. I'll deliver porridge to you.

00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:04.519
Look at the proposal we have here.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.640
The writer is truly talented.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.479
Excellent work.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.840
Maodou wrote it.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.840
I'm proofreading it.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.200
I think it's ordinary.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.150
It lacks careful consideration.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.650
She has to learn more from you.

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:15.880
Here.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.630
Zhixia, I've arranged
a 4D ultrasound scan for you.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.360
Thank you.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.039
When are you free for a meal?

00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:24.640
Recently,

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.740
I have to work overtime shifts.

00:31:26.759 --> 00:31:27.799
What about next time?

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.400
I'm quite busy this entire month.

00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:30.719
What about next month?

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.600
Or the month after?

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.940
I'm sure you have some free time.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.920
We're friends forever, right?

00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:36.319
See you.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.120
Please resume your work.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:40.719
Okay.

00:31:44.239 --> 00:31:44.920
How is it?

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.680
The doctor said everything was good.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.519
And, I have a 4D ultrasound scan
on the 1st of next month.

00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:51.319
I'm getting nervous now.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.840
What are you nervous about?

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.260
Every member of our family
was handsome and robust

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:57.960
going three generations back.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.400
But none of you was a HOD.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.239
I have to pass down the task
to the next generation.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.360
I'll leave it to you now.

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:08.590
Since you like the title so much,

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.079
why don't we call our child

00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:11.360
HOD Zhang?

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.920
That was a lousy joke.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.999
Say, since you're close with Dr. Li,

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.039
can we ask him to help us see

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.479
whether it's a boy or a girl?

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.840
What? You think
you can change our child's gender?

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.519
Of course not.

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:26.999
It's the same no matter the gender.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.920
We can't get Dr. Li fired because of us.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.160
You're right.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.709
Although your mom always said
both genders were equal,

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.810
and she treated Jiao
like a precious jewel,

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.160
I could tell

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.479
that your mom still wanted a grandson.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.350
I can't discuss this topic with her.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.840
Go back and give her a reminder.

00:32:49.239 --> 00:32:50.279
To favor boys over girls

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.160
is just like accepting bribes.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.799
One shouldn't even think about it,

00:32:54.079 --> 00:32:55.200
let alone do it.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.719
Say,

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.039
my mom said the exact same thing

00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:00.360
you said just now.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.200
Don't worry.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.840
The old lady is well aware of it.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.120
She won't even think about it.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:04.950
My phone is ringing.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.600
Who's calling you?

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.039
It's Mom.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:11.840
Mom.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.120
Zhang Hao and I came to the hospital
for a pregnancy checkup.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:15.850
What's the matter?

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.120
Yeah. We're together.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.160
There's a clinic downstairs.

00:33:19.719 --> 00:33:21.650
They can identify
the gender of an unborn child.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.840
Mom, why are you bringing that up again?

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.279
I told Zhang Hao about it just now.

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:29.300
It's pointless since
we can't do anything about it.

00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:29.920
Yeah.

00:33:30.079 --> 00:33:31.200
Don't misunderstand me.

00:33:31.479 --> 00:33:33.559
I don't favor boys over girls.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.999
I just want to be prepared in advance.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.640
No matter what, I won't go there.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.920
Mom, please don't waste your time on it.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:41.880
I'll hang up now.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.940
I thought you said she was aware of it.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.559
That's not it.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.680
Was that what you meant by being aware?

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.840
Let's talk this over.
Why are you getting angry at me?

00:33:50.039 --> 00:33:50.880
Wait, Zhang Hao.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.039
Why is your mom obsessed with

00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:54.120
our baby's gender recently?

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.440
Are you hiding something from me?

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.600
Not at all.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.039
Tell me!

00:33:58.039 --> 00:33:58.880
It's a tiny matter.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.319
Don't be angry when I tell you, okay?

00:34:02.319 --> 00:34:03.840
I'll be angrier if you keep it from me.

00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:06.999
Our old house is
scheduled for demolition.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.999
According to Mom,

00:34:08.999 --> 00:34:11.840
if we have a boy,
we'll buy a school district house.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.479
What if it's a girl?

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.240
We have
to buy something for her as well.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.760
Maybe a gold necklace.

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:21.639
We might give up
on the school district house.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.720
So, you're buying it if it's a boy,

00:34:27.479 --> 00:34:28.840
and scraping the idea if it's a girl.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.079
Your mom is
a retired official, you know?

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:33.199
Why is she acting the same

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.039
as my mom, who's merely a housewife?

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.100
She's always full of lofty principles
when she talks to me.

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:39.920
But now, she's revealing
her true colors, huh?

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.320
What do you mean by that?

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.039
What do you mean by true colors?

00:34:42.039 --> 00:34:43.550
What do you think her true colors are?

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.079
That's my mom you're talking about.

00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:46.519
She's getting old, you know?

00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:48.999
It's normal for old people
to favor boys over girls.

00:34:48.999 --> 00:34:49.999
She can say whatever she likes.

00:34:49.999 --> 00:34:51.159
We can just ignore her.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:51.800
Ignore her?

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.650
She'll keep pestering me
even if I ignore her.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.580
Do you think I need
more of that in my life?

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.079
I'll tell your mom about it now.

00:34:58.119 --> 00:34:59.199
This child is mine.

00:34:59.199 --> 00:35:00.320
She doesn't need to worry about it.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.360
Wait. What are you trying to tell her?

00:35:04.479 --> 00:35:05.199
We're a family.

00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:06.599
Why are you making
such a huge deal out of it?

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:07.599
She's my mom.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.119
We have to coax our parents.

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:10.119
You mustn't go against her.

00:35:10.119 --> 00:35:11.119
Why should I coax her?

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:12.559
Why should I?

00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:15.280
In this family, every member comes to me

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.479
whenever they're in trouble.

00:35:16.479 --> 00:35:17.999
You expect me to coax everyone?

00:35:17.999 --> 00:35:19.360
Am I the service model?

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:21.199
Zhang Hao, listen up.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.310
I'm done coaxing you all.
I don't want to do it again.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.199
From today onward,

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:25.559
I don't care if anyone gets angry.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.650
I'm pregnant. To me,
that's the most important thing.

00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:30.360
Now, I'll only treat myself nicely.

00:35:30.519 --> 00:35:32.079
I'll do whatever I like.

00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:33.079
Wait.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.679
Xu Zhixia!

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.199
In the future, when I have the dough,

00:35:54.199 --> 00:35:55.559
I'll buy gold bars for my baby.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.920
I'll save them up for him
until the day he gets married.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.519
I'm sure I'll be able
to buy a lot of gold for him.

00:35:59.519 --> 00:36:01.360
By then,
I'll give them all to him at once.

00:36:01.519 --> 00:36:02.880
Don't you think I'm very generous?

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.420
(1218)

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.620
(Birth Date, 18 December)

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.800
So, these aren't meant for us.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.720
Hello, Meiqi.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.400
Mingzhu, hurry and come.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.199
The shameless mistress is here again.

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:40.360
Who's this?

00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:41.360
Mickey Mouse.

00:36:44.479 --> 00:36:45.479
What are they doing?

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:48.800
Its head is covered.

00:36:51.479 --> 00:36:53.159
These are lions.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.599
Meiqi.

00:36:58.119 --> 00:36:59.679
Its head is stuck in the fish bowl.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.930
You took your kid to the hospital
just to fight for the inheritance, huh?

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.240
Do you think that's appropriate?

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.350
You're overthinking it.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.119
I know that you guys are penniless now.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.479
Why are you still here, then?

00:37:12.479 --> 00:37:13.720
I need to return
to my hometown for a few days.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.830
There's no one to look after Xiaoqi.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.720
So?

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.720
What has that got to do with us?

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.440
Of course it has
something to do with you.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.479
Xiaoqi's surname is Feng.

00:37:19.479 --> 00:37:21.250
That means the Feng family
has to look after him.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.840
Although his dad is dead,
he still has a stepsister.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880
And a stepsister-in-law.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.479
We don't even know
if he's Dad's child or not.

00:37:25.479 --> 00:37:26.360
Nonsense!

00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:33.950
Want to see a photo of your dad
cutting his umbilical cord?

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.599
Do you want to see
the photos of your dad

00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:37.400
hosting the full-moon banquet?

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.840
What about the photos we took
when we were in a hot spring together?

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.479
Get lost!

00:37:39.479 --> 00:37:41.079
That's enough.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.720
My father-in-law
has already passed away.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.199
Stop hurting each other.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:47.960
Fine.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.559
Here is Xiaoqi's water cup

00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:54.760
and some clean clothes.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.639
Please look after him
for the next few days.

00:37:56.639 --> 00:37:57.950
I'll return as soon as possible.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.760
Are you serious?

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.159
How do you expect us
to look after a young child like him?

00:38:02.159 --> 00:38:03.479
No mom would do such a thing.

00:38:03.479 --> 00:38:04.950
Do you think
I'm doing so of my own accord?

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.790
You're trying your best to raise funds
for your mother-in-law's treatment.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.999
I'm trying my best to make money

00:38:08.999 --> 00:38:09.840
to raise Xiaoqi.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.119
Doesn't that make us the same?

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.870
A round-trip flight to my hometown
costs 3,000 yuan.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.450
If I take my child with me,
I have to fork out another 3,000 yuan.

00:38:15.639 --> 00:38:17.320
Will you guys pay for that?

00:38:23.479 --> 00:38:24.199
Please.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:28.920
Xiaoqi.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.440
I'll make a move first.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.240
Goodbye, Mom.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.360
Ding Hong.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.920
Ding Hong!

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.960
Ding Hong, don't leave!

00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:40.199
Miss!

00:38:41.199 --> 00:38:41.920
Miss,

00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:44.679
Mom told me to follow you.

00:38:56.479 --> 00:38:57.119
Where is she?

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.320
She ran away.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.199
She's not picking up.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.210
What should we do, then?

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:22.960
Let's call the cops.

00:39:31.479 --> 00:39:32.159
Don't worry.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.159
We already managed
to contact Feng Xiaoqi's mom.

00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:34.840
What did she say?

00:39:35.079 --> 00:39:37.280
She said she had to return to her hometown
due to an emergency.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.119
She has entrusted her child

00:39:38.119 --> 00:39:39.450
to his sister-in-law and elder sister.

00:39:39.479 --> 00:39:39.960
By the way,

00:39:40.159 --> 00:39:41.840
which of you is his elder sister?

00:39:42.119 --> 00:39:42.960
She's my elder sister.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.720
I'm not your elder sister.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.720
I don't even know you.

00:39:46.599 --> 00:39:47.199
Miss,

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.639
show me your ID card.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.920
Sir, you don't understand the situation.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.479
He's not my...

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:55.400
Enough.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.679
Sir, it's like this.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.360
My father-in-law had this child
outside our family.

00:40:03.199 --> 00:40:04.119
Where is he, then?

00:40:05.199 --> 00:40:06.240
He has already passed away.

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:11.079
Well, this is a family dispute, then.

00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:13.479
Wait here.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.960
Let me make another call.

00:40:27.479 --> 00:40:28.840
Hello. How can I help you?

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.079
I need a room.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:30.720
Okay.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.479
I want a suite.

00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:34.800
Miss,

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.280
a suite costs 2,888 yuan.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.479
Please change it
to a Deluxe King Room instead.

00:40:43.479 --> 00:40:44.760
A suite is too big for me.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.639
I'm alone.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.960
It'll be scary.

00:40:47.639 --> 00:40:48.240
Okay.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.440
Dear.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:10.920
Dear?

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:34.119
Xu Zhixia,

00:41:35.079 --> 00:41:36.079
great job.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.960
You're finally willing
to spend money on yourself.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.479
You should've treated yourself
nicely from the start.

00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:50.479
It's gorgeous.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.720
What did she say?

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:56.400
She didn't answer my call.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.679
She's abandoning her child
when he's this young?

00:41:58.679 --> 00:41:59.679
Sir, doesn't this count as abandonment?

00:41:59.679 --> 00:42:01.100
Miss, that's enough. Please calm down.

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:02.119
The case of abandonment

00:42:02.199 --> 00:42:03.599
doesn't depend solely
on objective actions.

00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:04.830
It also depends on subjective intent.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.060
You guys don't get to decide that.

00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:08.079
Wait. What should we do now, then?

00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:09.599
Since you guys are his elder sisters,

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:10.599
and he's quite young,

00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:11.950
it's inconvenient
for you guys to remain here.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.960
You guys should take him home

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.160
and look after him for now.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.479
What kind of solution is that?

00:42:15.479 --> 00:42:16.679
You're a cop.

00:42:16.679 --> 00:42:17.960
Sir, listen to me.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.320
Right now,
we have a patient to look after.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.519
And, she's still hospitalized.

00:42:20.519 --> 00:42:22.720
We are in no shape
to look after another child.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.760
Yeah. Besides...

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.479
Enough.

00:42:24.679 --> 00:42:26.240
Now, you have two choices.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.360
Firstly, overcome your hardships

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.479
and take him home.

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.199
Secondly, let the child
overcome his hardships

00:42:30.199 --> 00:42:31.550
and let him wait for his mom here.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.760
Wait. Didn't you say that
his mom didn't pick up the phone?

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.350
That's why I said you have to wait here.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.960
You have to wait until
she picks up the phone.
