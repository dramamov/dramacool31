00:01:47.994 --> 00:01:48.873
I don't think

00:01:48.994 --> 00:01:49.793
it's as dangerous

00:01:49.793 --> 00:01:50.513
as it sounds.

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:52.313
Don't make hasty judgments.

00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:53.393
Better be careful.

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:54.714
Got it.

00:01:54.953 --> 00:01:56.033
I'll scout ahead.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.634
No one knows what it's like

00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:02.914
in there.

00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:04.593
If we get separated...

00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:05.313
We won't.

00:02:05.714 --> 00:02:07.074
I'll find you.

00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:09.314
I trust you.

00:02:31.754 --> 00:02:33.393
Why is the fog getting thicker?

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:34.553
Indeed.

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:36.194
I can't see anything ahead.

00:02:36.393 --> 00:02:37.673
If there are traps here,

00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:39.034
none of us can escape.

00:02:39.754 --> 00:02:40.594
Lady Ling Bo,

00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:41.594
what should we do?

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:42.874
Should we proceed or not?

00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:44.034
The fog is unnatural.

00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:45.634
Lady Ling Bo, please tell us

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:46.673
what to do.

00:02:46.793 --> 00:02:47.754
- Absolutely!
- Absolutely!

00:02:47.914 --> 00:02:48.474
Your call.

00:02:48.474 --> 00:02:48.993
Guide us.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:49.673
- Make the call.
- Yeah.

00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:54.034
It's fine. Trust your instincts.

00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:54.534
Let's go.

00:02:54.594 --> 00:02:56.154
I don't rely on intuition.

00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:57.434
I can't think of

00:02:57.434 --> 00:02:58.953
a safer approach.

00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:00.113
Why bother?

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:01.393
Can't we just charge in?

00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:03.314
I must prioritize everyone's safety.

00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:07.713
Let me scout for you.

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:16.673
Wait for me.

00:03:16.673 --> 00:03:17.314
Wait.

00:03:17.673 --> 00:03:18.354
Wait.

00:03:18.673 --> 00:03:19.874
Let's see how it goes.

00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:20.993
I don't hear anything.

00:03:21.113 --> 00:03:21.634
It's fine.

00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:23.314
The silence is what's frightening.

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:25.154
So you're a coward after all.

00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:27.273
That's what you think of me?

00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:31.074
Let me prove myself to you.

00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:33.273
Come on, don't be upset.

00:03:33.553 --> 00:03:34.393
Zhou Xiao.

00:03:43.953 --> 00:03:45.034
What's that noise?

00:03:45.713 --> 00:03:48.194
It's fine. Don't be scared.
I'm here for you.

00:03:48.314 --> 00:03:49.233
Let's go, then.

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:03.233
Huan Zong,

00:04:03.354 --> 00:04:04.273
why are we

00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:05.793
suddenly alone?

00:04:05.953 --> 00:04:07.793
I think they got scattered

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:08.953
in the thick fog.

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:13.354
It's fine. Don't be scared.

00:04:13.513 --> 00:04:14.914
Just hold onto me.

00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:19.234
With you here, I'm not scared.

00:04:19.353 --> 00:04:20.393
I'm not scared at all.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.634
Not at all.

00:04:21.953 --> 00:04:22.794
Good for you.

00:04:23.314 --> 00:04:23.953
Let's

00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:25.754
follow this path onward

00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:27.074
and may find the entrance.

00:04:27.153 --> 00:04:27.754
Alright.

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:38.393
Huan Zong,

00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:39.674
why haven't we seen

00:04:39.674 --> 00:04:40.874
anyone from other sects?

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.074
Where did they go?

00:04:42.913 --> 00:04:44.874
I think the secret realm is a formation

00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:45.874
that teleports visitors

00:04:45.874 --> 00:04:47.393
to different locations.

00:04:47.794 --> 00:04:49.953
What an expansive formation.

00:04:50.634 --> 00:04:51.713
Impressive.

00:04:52.234 --> 00:04:54.114
But there are so many places

00:04:54.114 --> 00:04:55.074
to search.

00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:56.033
Where to look for

00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:57.634
the Cloudseeker Twig and Merfolk Scale?

00:04:58.634 --> 00:05:00.114
It was never meant to be easy.

00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:01.994
Let's stay alert.

00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:03.033
There might be

00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:04.314
traps and deadly mechanisms.

00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:09.194
Huan Zong.

00:05:09.314 --> 00:05:09.953
Look.

00:05:10.554 --> 00:05:12.033
Bo Yuan Residence.

00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:14.033
(Bo Yuan Residence)
Why would

00:05:14.153 --> 00:05:15.273
Immortal Bo Yuan

00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:17.074
live in such a desolate place?

00:05:17.194 --> 00:05:18.314
There's nothing here.

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:19.994
He truly has...

00:05:19.994 --> 00:05:21.314
A unique taste.

00:05:21.434 --> 00:05:23.513
Indeed. Eccentric tastes.

00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:25.953
Stay alert.

00:05:26.114 --> 00:05:27.114
Let's keep going.

00:05:31.953 --> 00:05:32.634
Careful.

00:05:44.353 --> 00:05:45.913
But remember this.

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:48.794
This place may look simple

00:05:48.953 --> 00:05:50.074
and unoccupied.

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:52.434
But the simpler it seems,

00:05:52.434 --> 00:05:53.754
the more dangerous it can be.

00:05:54.194 --> 00:05:55.194
Exactly.

00:05:55.353 --> 00:05:57.794
A master like Immortal Bo Yuan

00:05:57.794 --> 00:05:58.833
would create formations

00:05:58.953 --> 00:06:00.794
that are absolutely top-tier.

00:06:01.234 --> 00:06:02.393
I wonder

00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:04.833
how Lin Hu is doing now.

00:06:04.953 --> 00:06:06.593
He should be fine.

00:06:07.353 --> 00:06:08.314
You know what?

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.554
A thousand years ago, Immortal Bo Yuan

00:06:10.634 --> 00:06:11.953
clashed with demon cultivators,

00:06:12.314 --> 00:06:13.434
who often fought

00:06:13.554 --> 00:06:15.273
cultivators from the Lingyou Realm.

00:06:15.593 --> 00:06:17.194
Since Lin Hu is a demon cultivator,

00:06:17.434 --> 00:06:18.353
he'll likely receive

00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:20.513
special treatment here.

00:06:21.194 --> 00:06:23.353
So he's in serious trouble?

00:06:23.913 --> 00:06:24.874
He should be okay.

00:06:27.713 --> 00:06:28.554
Stop striking me.

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:31.554
Come on.

00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:33.273
It's been thousands of years.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.314
Why are you still

00:06:34.314 --> 00:06:35.634
so harsh on a demon cultivator?

00:06:35.713 --> 00:06:37.153
Just stop, okay?

00:06:39.674 --> 00:06:40.434
Stay away from me.

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:41.074
What are you

00:06:41.074 --> 00:06:42.033
shouting there?

00:06:42.554 --> 00:06:43.554
Lady Ling Bo.

00:06:43.593 --> 00:06:44.593
Help me.

00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:47.593
What are you doing?

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:48.913
I got thunder strikes.

00:06:49.593 --> 00:06:50.473
Where?

00:06:51.074 --> 00:06:51.874
Show me the burns.

00:06:51.874 --> 00:06:52.674
Not there.

00:06:52.674 --> 00:06:53.473
Immortal Bo Yuan

00:06:53.554 --> 00:06:54.874
hates demon cultivators so much?

00:06:54.874 --> 00:06:56.353
He's throwing thunder strikes at me.

00:06:56.434 --> 00:06:57.513
What can we do?

00:06:58.194 --> 00:06:59.554
Why don't you leave?

00:06:59.674 --> 00:07:00.674
No way!

00:07:00.674 --> 00:07:01.353
I came for

00:07:01.353 --> 00:07:02.273
an important mission.

00:07:02.273 --> 00:07:03.153
I can't just leave.

00:07:04.074 --> 00:07:05.713
Then suffer through it.

00:07:06.074 --> 00:07:07.074
You're so heartless.

00:07:07.074 --> 00:07:08.194
Can't you help me?

00:07:08.273 --> 00:07:08.874
How?

00:07:08.874 --> 00:07:09.434
I...

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:12.393
I bet you wouldn't

00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:13.353
tell anyone about it.

00:07:13.353 --> 00:07:13.913
Whatever.

00:07:14.114 --> 00:07:14.953
Sorry.

00:07:15.593 --> 00:07:16.353
What are you doing?

00:07:16.434 --> 00:07:17.833
Do me a favor, please.

00:07:17.953 --> 00:07:19.153
Why do I care

00:07:19.153 --> 00:07:20.554
if you're getting thunder strikes?

00:07:20.554 --> 00:07:21.353
Die for all I care.

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:23.194
Don't go.

00:07:23.213 --> 00:07:23.713
Wait.

00:07:23.713 --> 00:07:25.114
Do you have a death wish?

00:07:25.114 --> 00:07:26.554
Come on, stop moving.

00:07:26.554 --> 00:07:27.114
Listen.

00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:28.153
The secret realm

00:07:28.153 --> 00:07:29.194
is against me.

00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:31.353
I can avoid thunder strikes next to you.

00:07:31.353 --> 00:07:32.153
If you won't

00:07:32.153 --> 00:07:33.273
- let me hold you,
- Let go.

00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:34.674
I'll just stay close. Okay?

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.473
Why are you clinging to me?

00:07:37.134 --> 00:07:37.634
Lecher.

00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:38.593
Who's a lecher?

00:07:38.593 --> 00:07:39.194
I'm targeted

00:07:39.194 --> 00:07:40.634
by the thunder strikes.

00:07:40.634 --> 00:07:42.353
But it doesn't target you.

00:07:42.473 --> 00:07:43.473
How dare...

00:07:43.473 --> 00:07:44.713
Ouch.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.473
What is this?

00:07:59.593 --> 00:08:00.353
A demon mark.

00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:01.794
Tell you what.

00:08:01.953 --> 00:08:03.554
We're bound now.

00:08:03.674 --> 00:08:04.593
I warn you,

00:08:04.713 --> 00:08:05.554
remove this mark

00:08:05.554 --> 00:08:06.434
right now.

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:07.754
I can't.

00:08:07.874 --> 00:08:08.953
You can't?

00:08:08.953 --> 00:08:09.913
Didn't you cast this?

00:08:09.913 --> 00:08:10.713
You can't undo it?

00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:11.833
To remove this mark,

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:13.913
I need Young Master's assistance.

00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:15.074
I can't undo it alone.

00:08:18.314 --> 00:08:20.194
Then what good are you?

00:08:20.314 --> 00:08:21.434
I'll kill you now.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.634
Wait, don't.

00:08:24.513 --> 00:08:25.634
You can't kill me.

00:08:25.794 --> 00:08:27.314
The demon mark binds us.

00:08:27.353 --> 00:08:27.953
We share

00:08:27.953 --> 00:08:28.994
life and death now.

00:08:28.994 --> 00:08:30.353
Kill me and you'll die, too.

00:08:33.394 --> 00:08:34.514
Sure, I won't kill you.

00:08:38.194 --> 00:08:40.074
T-That was way too harsh.

00:08:40.194 --> 00:08:42.074
You're lucky I didn't kill you.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:00.633
Huan Zong.

00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:01.713
Look.

00:09:02.353 --> 00:09:03.593
That tree is just like

00:09:03.713 --> 00:09:04.833
the Cloudseeker Twig

00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:05.633
in the books.

00:09:05.794 --> 00:09:07.674
We already found the Cloudseeker Twigs?

00:09:13.713 --> 00:09:15.034
Cloudseeker Twigs.

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:17.074
Tree trunks show dark violet hues.

00:09:17.194 --> 00:09:18.873
Branches twist and curl.

00:09:18.993 --> 00:09:20.993
Thick at the base
and tapering at the tips.

00:09:21.074 --> 00:09:22.993
Leaves and flowers
share that deep purple.

00:09:23.113 --> 00:09:24.473
Tiny as new sprouts.

00:09:24.713 --> 00:09:25.833
That's how the tree

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:26.993
in this sphere looks.

00:09:27.514 --> 00:09:28.593
But

00:09:29.113 --> 00:09:30.674
the book also says

00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:33.274
that the Cloudseeker Tree
reaches five zhang tall.

00:09:33.314 --> 00:09:35.593
The sphere is less than five cun.

00:09:35.713 --> 00:09:36.833
Does it contain

00:09:37.233 --> 00:09:38.674
a different world?

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:48.753
(This is my abode.)

00:09:48.873 --> 00:09:51.953
(Only Void Unity stage cultivators
may enter.)

00:09:52.074 --> 00:09:55.434
(Lesser cultivators, know your limits.)

00:09:55.514 --> 00:09:56.434
So this is

00:09:56.514 --> 00:09:58.154
Immortal Bo Yuan's former residence.

00:09:58.233 --> 00:09:58.914
I didn't know

00:09:59.034 --> 00:10:00.713
he actually lived inside a sphere.

00:10:01.753 --> 00:10:03.833
He had an eccentric taste.

00:10:04.554 --> 00:10:06.434
But Immortal Bo Yuan

00:10:06.554 --> 00:10:07.434
is utterly

00:10:07.554 --> 00:10:08.753
arrogant,

00:10:08.873 --> 00:10:09.753
only welcoming

00:10:09.873 --> 00:10:11.074
cultivators

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.274
at the Void Unity stage.

00:10:12.753 --> 00:10:14.314
He's just making things difficult,

00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:16.953
showing treasures
but keeping them beyond reach.

00:10:17.473 --> 00:10:18.593
I guess

00:10:19.154 --> 00:10:19.794
he didn't want

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.314
to be disturbed.

00:10:22.074 --> 00:10:22.674
Wait.

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:23.633
Huan Zong.

00:10:24.194 --> 00:10:26.953
Spirit Division,
Void Unity, Great Perfection.

00:10:27.074 --> 00:10:29.434
You're at peak Spirit Division stage.

00:10:29.554 --> 00:10:30.353
Though

00:10:30.593 --> 00:10:31.554
I'm nowhere

00:10:31.633 --> 00:10:32.633
near your level,

00:10:32.753 --> 00:10:34.274
I did gain the recognition of

00:10:34.394 --> 00:10:35.753
the phoenix-headed konghou.

00:10:35.873 --> 00:10:37.353
Are you suggesting

00:10:37.674 --> 00:10:39.753
that we might break through this barrier

00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:41.434
with Harmony Sync?

00:10:42.353 --> 00:10:43.194
It's worth trying.

00:10:43.593 --> 00:10:44.194
Alright.

00:11:11.633 --> 00:11:13.034
Huan Zong, look.

00:11:13.154 --> 00:11:14.353
We managed to get in.

00:11:14.434 --> 00:11:16.154
Harmony Sync worked perfectly.

00:11:20.394 --> 00:11:22.233
The tree is enormous.

00:11:23.554 --> 00:11:25.314
Oh no, I forgot something.

00:11:25.394 --> 00:11:26.314
What did you forget?

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:27.473
An axe.

00:11:27.593 --> 00:11:28.674
What for?

00:11:28.753 --> 00:11:30.154
With a tree this size,

00:11:30.154 --> 00:11:31.274
I need an axe

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.274
to chop it down.

00:11:32.674 --> 00:11:33.794
What do we do?

00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:34.794
I didn't expect

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:36.633
to encounter something like this.

00:11:40.113 --> 00:11:40.914
This will suffice.

00:11:42.554 --> 00:11:44.034
I was way off.

00:11:44.154 --> 00:11:45.233
And cruel.

00:11:46.194 --> 00:11:47.593
Stop pacing back and forth.

00:11:47.713 --> 00:11:48.633
Take a break.

00:11:53.873 --> 00:11:56.034
Such a great opportunity,
and we're guarding the gates.

00:11:56.113 --> 00:11:57.274
Isn't it nice?

00:11:57.274 --> 00:11:58.314
It's easy work.

00:12:00.674 --> 00:12:01.833
After all these years,

00:12:01.993 --> 00:12:02.833
how come you're still

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:03.993
so spineless and aimless?

00:12:04.274 --> 00:12:05.914
H-How am I aimless?

00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:08.554
I-I work hard for spirit stones.

00:12:08.674 --> 00:12:10.034
We have different aspirations.

00:12:10.034 --> 00:12:10.633
Alright?

00:12:11.993 --> 00:12:13.034
Different aspirations?

00:12:13.314 --> 00:12:14.993
Then why even come here?

00:12:15.074 --> 00:12:16.473
Keep grinding for spirit stones.

00:12:20.074 --> 00:12:20.914
Honestly,

00:12:20.993 --> 00:12:22.554
why did you come?

00:12:23.353 --> 00:12:24.233
You're using Kong Hou

00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:25.233
as an excuse.

00:12:26.674 --> 00:12:28.113
You must have...

00:12:28.633 --> 00:12:30.314
W-What?

00:12:32.473 --> 00:12:33.314
You must have found

00:12:33.314 --> 00:12:34.554
a way to profit

00:12:34.674 --> 00:12:36.034
from the secret realm.

00:12:36.353 --> 00:12:38.353
Yeah, let's just go with that.

00:12:43.873 --> 00:12:45.353
Your messenger talisman is here.

00:12:45.353 --> 00:12:46.154
Open it.

00:12:46.713 --> 00:12:48.154
In a while.

00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:49.434
I'll help you.

00:12:49.914 --> 00:12:50.414
You...

00:12:50.993 --> 00:12:52.514
(Tan Feng, where is Kong Hou?)

00:12:52.633 --> 00:12:53.713
(You promised to bring)

00:12:53.713 --> 00:12:54.713
(her here ages ago.)

00:12:54.713 --> 00:12:57.154
(Where is she? Where?)

00:13:08.514 --> 00:13:09.394
What's that sound?

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:17.953
Over there. Let's check.

00:13:18.794 --> 00:13:19.593
Be careful.

00:13:20.394 --> 00:13:21.034
Got it.

00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:26.434
Ling Bo?

00:13:27.274 --> 00:13:28.233
Lin Hu.

00:13:28.554 --> 00:13:29.194
Ling Bo.

00:13:30.713 --> 00:13:31.353
Ling Bo.

00:13:33.194 --> 00:13:34.314
What happened?

00:13:34.674 --> 00:13:35.674
Lin Hu.

00:13:35.674 --> 00:13:37.314
It's a formation. Don't panic.

00:13:41.274 --> 00:13:42.074
Ling Bo.

00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:44.034
You entered a formation. Stay calm.

00:13:44.034 --> 00:13:44.914
Try reciting

00:13:44.993 --> 00:13:46.434
your sect's formation incantation.

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:48.593
Jin Ling.

00:13:55.473 --> 00:13:56.753
That's her flute.

00:13:57.233 --> 00:13:58.593
Is she in danger?

00:13:58.713 --> 00:13:59.434
Jin Ling.

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:01.674
Jin Ling.

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:04.794
Jin Ling.

00:14:07.034 --> 00:14:07.753
Jin Ling.

00:14:13.914 --> 00:14:15.154
Let me help you.

00:14:19.753 --> 00:14:20.473
Thank you.

00:14:20.473 --> 00:14:21.113
You're welcome.

00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:22.833
May I know your name?

00:14:22.833 --> 00:14:24.384
Chi Si, Rogue Cultivators Alliance.

00:14:24.384 --> 00:14:25.353
We met outside

00:14:25.353 --> 00:14:26.514
the secret realm.

00:14:26.753 --> 00:14:28.154
Thank you for saving me.

00:14:28.473 --> 00:14:29.514
My junior is in peril.

00:14:29.593 --> 00:14:30.473
Catch up later.

00:14:30.554 --> 00:14:31.194
Wait.

00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:32.674
Let me come with you

00:14:32.713 --> 00:14:33.713
to help.

00:14:35.633 --> 00:14:36.314
Alright.

00:14:36.394 --> 00:14:37.154
Huan Zong.

00:14:37.154 --> 00:14:38.674
We only need the Merfolk Scale now.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.677
(Storybook)

00:14:48.034 --> 00:14:48.953
To think we'd find

00:14:48.953 --> 00:14:50.554
something like storybooks

00:14:50.674 --> 00:14:52.394
in Immortal Bo Yuan's residence.

00:14:53.034 --> 00:14:53.753
Don't tell me

00:14:53.753 --> 00:14:55.074
it's a spiritual tool.

00:14:58.953 --> 00:15:00.154
I think

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.993
this is just a regular storybook.

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:04.113
He was probably reading it

00:15:04.113 --> 00:15:04.914
during the breaks

00:15:05.034 --> 00:15:06.593
when he was tired of cultivating.

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.593
I thought

00:15:09.593 --> 00:15:10.953
Immortal Bo Yuan

00:15:10.953 --> 00:15:12.314
only focused on

00:15:12.314 --> 00:15:13.794
studying spiritual arts.

00:15:13.953 --> 00:15:14.713
Who'd have thought

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:16.194
that he read storybooks too?

00:15:16.434 --> 00:15:18.314
Now he sounds

00:15:18.353 --> 00:15:19.674
more like a human.

00:15:20.058 --> 00:15:20.992
(Heart's Ballad)

00:15:21.794 --> 00:15:22.794
Huan Zong, look.

00:15:22.953 --> 00:15:24.394
The edges of this book

00:15:24.394 --> 00:15:25.713
are worn from his reading.

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:26.713
Clearly,

00:15:26.713 --> 00:15:27.633
this must've been

00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:28.914
his favorite storybook.

00:15:29.993 --> 00:15:32.113
Would it be inappropriate

00:15:32.674 --> 00:15:34.274
to take all his favorite items

00:15:34.394 --> 00:15:35.993
out of the secret realm

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:37.794
with me?

00:15:37.914 --> 00:15:38.713
It's alright.

00:15:39.113 --> 00:15:40.154
He left us

00:15:40.274 --> 00:15:41.953
these treasures to benefit

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.434
the Lingyou Realm.

00:15:43.473 --> 00:15:45.113
Then I'll take them all.

00:15:45.113 --> 00:15:45.713
After all,

00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:46.794
we earned our way in.

00:15:46.794 --> 00:15:47.394
Right?

00:15:47.873 --> 00:15:48.434
Yeah.

00:15:50.993 --> 00:15:52.873
So many spiritual fruits here too.

00:15:52.914 --> 00:15:54.473
Turns out Immortal Bo Yuan

00:15:54.473 --> 00:15:55.753
knows how to enjoy life.

00:15:56.034 --> 00:15:58.233
Had he not ascended,

00:15:58.873 --> 00:15:59.993
you two

00:16:00.154 --> 00:16:01.873
would've been great friends.

00:16:01.993 --> 00:16:03.713
Then we shouldn't

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.154
mock his eccentric tastes anymore.

00:16:05.353 --> 00:16:06.593
Since we

00:16:06.593 --> 00:16:07.794
would have been close,

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:09.593
we should say...

00:16:09.953 --> 00:16:10.674
What?

00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:13.194
That he has a refined taste.

00:16:13.274 --> 00:16:14.353
That he's interesting,

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.554
witty, and humorous.

00:16:15.873 --> 00:16:16.514
Alright.

00:16:17.113 --> 00:16:18.314
Lin Hu.

00:16:19.633 --> 00:16:20.713
Lin Hu.

00:16:24.154 --> 00:16:25.274
Formation incantation.

00:16:25.473 --> 00:16:27.953
Right, the formation incantation
Lin Hu mentioned.

00:16:30.674 --> 00:16:33.593
Qian's three unbroken lines
open heaven in the northwest.

00:16:34.154 --> 00:16:36.394
Kun's six broken segments
divide earth in the southwest.

00:16:36.674 --> 00:16:39.554
Gen's inverted bowl
aligns mountains in the northeast.

00:16:39.674 --> 00:16:42.034
Zhen's upright bowl
brings thunder strikes to the east.

00:17:01.633 --> 00:17:03.914
Qian's three unbroken lines
open heaven in the northwest.

00:17:03.914 --> 00:17:05.888
Kun's six broken segments
divide earth southwest.

00:17:09.472 --> 00:17:11.392
Gen's inverted bowl
aligns mountains northeast.

00:17:11.392 --> 00:17:13.312
Zhen's upright bowl
brings thunder strikes east.

00:17:13.754 --> 00:17:14.393
Open.

00:17:16.474 --> 00:17:17.954
That's the incantation.

00:17:18.074 --> 00:17:19.714
Why doesn't it work?

00:17:20.353 --> 00:17:23.873
Zhen's upright bowl
brings thunder strikes to the east.

00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:25.633
Where is the exit?

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:26.913
I've said it so many times.

00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:28.353
Thunder strikes in the east...

00:17:29.433 --> 00:17:30.554
Lin Hu.

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:31.514
Ling Bo.

00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:32.714
Lin Hu.

00:17:32.954 --> 00:17:33.593
Ling Bo.

00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:34.433
Lin Hu.

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:35.673
Lin Hu.

00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:37.193
- Are you alright?
- You alright?

00:17:37.193 --> 00:17:37.794
I thought

00:17:37.794 --> 00:17:38.994
I'd never see you again.

00:17:39.113 --> 00:17:40.193
A-Are...

00:17:40.314 --> 00:17:41.833
Are you worried about me?

00:17:43.593 --> 00:17:44.873
Our Zhaohan Sect is a model

00:17:44.873 --> 00:17:46.193
among the Ten Great Sects.

00:17:46.193 --> 00:17:47.954
As the leader of the Zhaohan Sect,

00:17:47.974 --> 00:17:48.474
I must

00:17:48.474 --> 00:17:49.714
ensure your safety.

00:17:49.794 --> 00:17:50.954
Come on,

00:17:50.954 --> 00:17:52.954
stop being so formal.

00:17:53.234 --> 00:17:53.794
You can't

00:17:53.873 --> 00:17:55.074
find the exit either?

00:17:56.593 --> 00:17:57.673
I don't think

00:17:57.754 --> 00:17:58.994
your incantation

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.034
works at all.

00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:00.754
People say

00:18:00.754 --> 00:18:02.673
that Immortal Bo Yuan
follows his own whims

00:18:02.673 --> 00:18:04.274
and never acts conventionally.

00:18:04.433 --> 00:18:06.433
If we keep repeating the standard

00:18:06.474 --> 00:18:07.474
incantations,

00:18:07.474 --> 00:18:08.954
we'll never find the exit.

00:18:09.034 --> 00:18:10.833
So what should we do?

00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:12.954
There is nothing else to do.

00:18:15.193 --> 00:18:15.833
I see.

00:18:15.913 --> 00:18:17.314
We can try some

00:18:17.314 --> 00:18:18.633
unconventional incantations.

00:18:18.633 --> 00:18:19.314
Like what?

00:18:21.554 --> 00:18:23.034
The moon sets, and crows caw.

00:18:23.074 --> 00:18:24.913
I'll spend money to get out of here.

00:18:26.433 --> 00:18:27.554
I've never heard of

00:18:27.554 --> 00:18:28.554
such an incantation.

00:18:28.673 --> 00:18:29.514
It's just a rhyme,

00:18:29.514 --> 00:18:30.994
not an incantation.

00:18:30.994 --> 00:18:31.954
I just wanted to try.

00:18:32.754 --> 00:18:34.673
What nonsense.

00:18:35.234 --> 00:18:36.714
If I'm spouting nonsense,

00:18:36.754 --> 00:18:37.514
why don't you

00:18:37.514 --> 00:18:38.554
come up with something?

00:18:39.153 --> 00:18:40.794
The general marches south with valor,

00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:42.474
with a sharp sword at his waist.

00:18:42.593 --> 00:18:43.314
What was that?

00:18:43.393 --> 00:18:44.234
An ancient poem.

00:18:44.234 --> 00:18:45.714
You recited storyteller rhymes.

00:18:45.714 --> 00:18:46.994
Can't I recite poems?

00:18:47.113 --> 00:18:48.514
I know poems too.

00:18:48.954 --> 00:18:50.433
Before my bed, moonlight pools...

00:18:50.433 --> 00:18:51.234
Enough.

00:18:51.234 --> 00:18:52.193
Forget it.

00:18:52.193 --> 00:18:53.433
It's not working.

00:18:54.913 --> 00:18:56.673
Nothing works.

00:18:56.714 --> 00:18:57.474
What should we do?

00:18:57.474 --> 00:18:58.113
We've tried

00:18:58.113 --> 00:18:58.633
everything.

00:18:58.633 --> 00:18:59.554
I have an idea.

00:18:59.554 --> 00:19:00.274
What is it?

00:19:00.274 --> 00:19:01.113
Let's wander around.

00:19:01.514 --> 00:19:02.314
What?

00:19:02.714 --> 00:19:04.633
Come on. Let's go.

00:19:05.234 --> 00:19:06.554
Are you serious?

00:19:14.593 --> 00:19:15.833
I've never seen

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:16.714
such a beautiful

00:19:16.714 --> 00:19:17.754
cup set.

00:19:18.393 --> 00:19:19.714
It looks familiar.

00:19:19.873 --> 00:19:20.393
I recall

00:19:20.393 --> 00:19:22.234
reading about it in a book.

00:19:22.633 --> 00:19:24.673
The Jiufeng Sect had this cup set.

00:19:24.994 --> 00:19:26.274
Pour plain water in,

00:19:26.393 --> 00:19:27.873
and it transforms into aged liquor.

00:19:28.034 --> 00:19:29.913
What an amazing treasure.

00:19:33.193 --> 00:19:34.393
I don't think

00:19:34.554 --> 00:19:35.954
the water turned into liquor.

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:37.113
It's nothing special.

00:19:37.274 --> 00:19:38.554
Try it.

00:19:40.954 --> 00:19:42.234
It's too spicy.

00:19:42.234 --> 00:19:43.314
It's really liquor.

00:19:45.314 --> 00:19:46.274
Well,

00:19:46.873 --> 00:19:47.873
Huan Zong,

00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:50.754
I like these, too.

00:19:50.754 --> 00:19:51.873
Just keep them.

00:19:52.034 --> 00:19:53.954
Then I'll take them.

00:19:57.714 --> 00:19:58.673
Jin Ling.

00:19:59.954 --> 00:20:00.913
Zhou Xiao.

00:20:01.274 --> 00:20:02.633
You seem anxious.

00:20:03.074 --> 00:20:04.433
Does Jin Ling's flute melody

00:20:04.673 --> 00:20:05.913
carry any special meaning?

00:20:07.794 --> 00:20:09.074
She is a music cultivator.

00:20:09.234 --> 00:20:10.314
We once made a pact

00:20:10.514 --> 00:20:11.554
that if she's in danger,

00:20:11.554 --> 00:20:12.994
she'd play this tune to alert me.

00:20:13.153 --> 00:20:14.016
I don't mean to pry,

00:20:14.393 --> 00:20:15.193
but Zhou Xiao,

00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:16.153
Jin Ling

00:20:16.193 --> 00:20:17.274
is not just

00:20:17.714 --> 00:20:19.234
an ordinary junior to you, right?

00:20:19.234 --> 00:20:19.954
It's fine.

00:20:20.074 --> 00:20:20.873
Jin Ling and I

00:20:20.873 --> 00:20:22.274
are getting married.

00:20:22.433 --> 00:20:23.714
No wonder you're so worried.

00:20:23.873 --> 00:20:24.393
Don't worry.

00:20:24.433 --> 00:20:25.074
She will surely

00:20:25.074 --> 00:20:26.153
overcome this adversity.

00:20:26.314 --> 00:20:27.314
We'll find her.

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:28.833
Thank you for your comfort.

00:20:35.353 --> 00:20:36.153
Chi Si, look.

00:20:39.193 --> 00:20:39.833
Oh no.

00:20:40.593 --> 00:20:42.034
We've entered a formation.

00:20:42.193 --> 00:20:42.873
That's right.

00:20:43.314 --> 00:20:44.193
There are

00:20:44.314 --> 00:20:45.754
no landmarks around us.

00:20:45.873 --> 00:20:46.633
We must stay close

00:20:46.633 --> 00:20:47.554
to each other.

00:20:47.673 --> 00:20:48.714
At this critical moment,

00:20:48.754 --> 00:20:49.913
we must stay calm.

00:20:50.593 --> 00:20:51.314
Chi Si...

00:20:53.593 --> 00:20:55.754
Chi Si, where are you?

00:20:55.994 --> 00:20:57.034
Are you alright?

00:20:57.113 --> 00:20:58.873
I'm fine. I'm trying to get out.

00:20:58.994 --> 00:21:00.314
This formation is strange.

00:21:00.314 --> 00:21:01.633
Let's both try to get out.

00:21:01.673 --> 00:21:02.353
Don't worry.

00:21:02.994 --> 00:21:04.353
We'll definitely get out.

00:21:06.113 --> 00:21:07.113
The spiritual fruits

00:21:07.113 --> 00:21:08.514
must be a thousand years old.

00:21:08.514 --> 00:21:09.673
They still look fresh.

00:21:13.034 --> 00:21:13.873
So sweet.

00:21:13.873 --> 00:21:15.673
This is no ordinary spiritual fruit.

00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:16.994
This Hongjian fruit

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:18.633
is born once every millennium.

00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:20.593
So, does it boost

00:21:20.593 --> 00:21:22.393
my spiritual energy?

00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:23.274
Of course.

00:21:24.314 --> 00:21:25.113
Then I will

00:21:25.153 --> 00:21:26.393
take them all back

00:21:26.393 --> 00:21:28.833
for our sect's
senior brothers and sisters.

00:21:29.593 --> 00:21:30.113
Alright.

00:21:30.193 --> 00:21:32.074
Let's leave now.

00:21:32.193 --> 00:21:32.794
Alright.

00:21:33.794 --> 00:21:35.913
(I've stored my life's mastery here.)

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:38.314
(Master them and apply them to use.)

00:21:38.314 --> 00:21:40.113
(Only by passing trials may you leave.)

00:21:40.113 --> 00:21:41.633
(Those who fail the trials)

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:43.474
(shall remain trapped for eternity.)

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:44.954
What does it mean?

00:21:45.113 --> 00:21:46.554
Immortal Bo Yuan

00:21:46.554 --> 00:21:48.074
assumes that since we've entered,

00:21:48.234 --> 00:21:50.034
we must be capable of mastering

00:21:50.034 --> 00:21:51.193
his life's work

00:21:51.193 --> 00:21:52.314
and passing it on

00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:53.673
to benefit the Lingyou Realm.

00:21:54.153 --> 00:21:55.913
If we fail to learn it,

00:21:56.673 --> 00:21:58.714
we might never get out.

00:21:59.393 --> 00:22:01.113
We may be trapped for life?

00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:02.113
So...

00:22:02.714 --> 00:22:04.113
So many books.

00:22:04.153 --> 00:22:05.554
How could we possibly

00:22:05.554 --> 00:22:06.633
learn everything?

00:22:06.754 --> 00:22:08.034
And he wants us to

00:22:08.034 --> 00:22:09.954
"master them and apply them to use"?

00:22:11.274 --> 00:22:12.554
No way.

00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:14.113
How about this, Huan Zong?

00:22:14.193 --> 00:22:15.554
Let's try

00:22:15.554 --> 00:22:16.833
Harmony Sync again

00:22:16.873 --> 00:22:18.153
and see if we can get out.

00:22:18.193 --> 00:22:19.794
I don't think it will work.

00:22:19.913 --> 00:22:20.873
Immortal Bo Yuan

00:22:20.913 --> 00:22:22.113
must have set

00:22:22.113 --> 00:22:23.714
specific formations here.

00:22:23.873 --> 00:22:25.274
If he says that we can't

00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:26.673
get out,

00:22:26.794 --> 00:22:28.113
I think he means it.

00:22:30.954 --> 00:22:32.714
Let's just stay here

00:22:33.034 --> 00:22:34.514
and try to learn

00:22:35.274 --> 00:22:36.754
the techniques.

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:42.954
Did we make it out?

00:22:43.714 --> 00:22:45.274
Did we make it out?

00:22:45.274 --> 00:22:46.954
Why don't you test it

00:22:47.113 --> 00:22:48.034
to find out?

00:22:48.034 --> 00:22:48.754
Test it?

00:22:48.954 --> 00:22:49.673
How?

00:22:50.714 --> 00:22:51.794
Ouch.

00:22:51.794 --> 00:22:52.954
You said, "Test it."

00:22:52.954 --> 00:22:54.754
- I...
- I tested it.

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:57.593
See? I'm amazing, right?

00:22:58.593 --> 00:22:59.833
J-Just average.

00:23:00.234 --> 00:23:01.994
After all, it doesn't
require much wisdom

00:23:01.994 --> 00:23:03.314
to wander about.

00:23:03.314 --> 00:23:05.153
You simply got lucky.

00:23:05.833 --> 00:23:06.954
Then why didn't you have

00:23:06.954 --> 00:23:08.274
such good luck?

00:23:08.514 --> 00:23:09.193
Enough.

00:23:09.433 --> 00:23:10.554
I don't need

00:23:10.554 --> 00:23:12.074
your appreciation.

00:23:15.474 --> 00:23:17.113
What's that sound?

00:23:17.353 --> 00:23:18.314
Did you hear that?

00:23:24.113 --> 00:23:26.794
When constructing
and analyzing a hexagram,

00:23:26.913 --> 00:23:29.393
make sure the "placement of the self"
is unharmed.

00:23:29.514 --> 00:23:31.913
One's destiny is shaped by experiences.

00:23:32.034 --> 00:23:34.314
One must not speculate arbitrarily.

00:23:34.393 --> 00:23:36.514
Focus on the Day Stem
in hexagram interpretation.

00:23:36.754 --> 00:23:38.193
The Day Stem represents "me".

00:23:38.353 --> 00:23:40.593
The Stems, Branches,
Lessons, and Evolutions

00:23:40.593 --> 00:23:41.794
all evolve around "me".

00:23:41.954 --> 00:23:43.673
If the First Lesson appears

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:45.353
within the Three Evolutions...

00:23:51.353 --> 00:23:52.034
Huan Zong.

00:23:52.673 --> 00:23:54.153
I just remembered

00:23:54.353 --> 00:23:55.913
that Immortal Bo Yuan

00:23:55.913 --> 00:23:57.074
was the only cultivator

00:23:57.074 --> 00:23:58.873
to ascend in millennia.

00:23:59.193 --> 00:24:00.113
If we could master

00:24:00.113 --> 00:24:01.514
all his techniques,

00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:03.153
wouldn't we become

00:24:03.274 --> 00:24:04.954
the greatest cultivators

00:24:04.954 --> 00:24:06.274
in this world?

00:24:07.074 --> 00:24:08.234
I don't think so.

00:24:08.433 --> 00:24:10.433
After studying these texts,

00:24:11.314 --> 00:24:12.353
I realized

00:24:12.353 --> 00:24:13.754
that these techniques

00:24:13.833 --> 00:24:15.673
may have been revolutionary

00:24:15.994 --> 00:24:17.554
millennia ago.

00:24:17.754 --> 00:24:19.193
But now,

00:24:20.234 --> 00:24:21.353
only some theories

00:24:21.353 --> 00:24:22.593
remain valuable.

00:24:22.954 --> 00:24:24.873
These techniques

00:24:25.393 --> 00:24:27.034
look outdated to me.

00:24:28.234 --> 00:24:29.873
Don't say that.

00:24:29.954 --> 00:24:31.633
If he hears you,

00:24:31.633 --> 00:24:32.873
he'll get upset.

00:24:32.873 --> 00:24:33.673
Then he surely

00:24:33.673 --> 00:24:34.833
won't let us out.

00:24:35.274 --> 00:24:37.193
So, what can we do?

00:24:37.193 --> 00:24:38.153
We have to

00:24:38.474 --> 00:24:39.754
keep studying.

00:24:43.706 --> 00:24:45.280
(Qin Residence)

00:24:56.593 --> 00:24:58.314
Y-You're covered in leaves.

00:24:58.314 --> 00:24:59.153
What's so funny?

00:24:59.153 --> 00:25:00.873
Look at you. You're covered in leaves.

00:25:01.234 --> 00:25:01.833
Come on.

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.393
What's so funny?

00:25:05.353 --> 00:25:06.714
You're not much better.

00:25:06.754 --> 00:25:07.794
Look.

00:25:07.833 --> 00:25:08.633
Look here.

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:09.754
Full of leaves.

00:25:10.274 --> 00:25:11.754
Who said that

00:25:11.833 --> 00:25:13.034
she was lucky?

00:25:13.034 --> 00:25:13.673
Well,

00:25:13.673 --> 00:25:14.633
we found no exit

00:25:14.673 --> 00:25:15.714
and got trapped here.

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:16.754
Are you blaming me?

00:25:16.873 --> 00:25:17.673
I wasn't looking

00:25:17.673 --> 00:25:18.514
for the right exit.

00:25:18.514 --> 00:25:19.673
That was your idea.

00:25:20.554 --> 00:25:22.074
You didn't object to it.

00:25:22.113 --> 00:25:22.754
Enough.

00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:24.034
Let's not bicker now.

00:25:24.274 --> 00:25:26.193
We'd better find a way out.

00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:28.193
What kind of place is this?

00:25:37.994 --> 00:25:38.673
Are you alright?

00:25:38.754 --> 00:25:39.393
I'm fine.

00:25:45.673 --> 00:25:46.433
Are you alright?

00:25:49.074 --> 00:25:50.314
What's happening?

00:25:50.474 --> 00:25:51.554
Isn't it obvious?

00:25:51.714 --> 00:25:52.954
This courtyard is set

00:25:52.954 --> 00:25:53.913
in special barriers.

00:25:53.954 --> 00:25:55.314
We can't get out.

00:25:55.593 --> 00:25:56.353
Of course,

00:25:56.353 --> 00:25:57.754
I know there are barriers.

00:26:00.673 --> 00:26:01.673
That hurts, huh?

00:26:04.153 --> 00:26:05.514
We somehow entered

00:26:05.514 --> 00:26:06.514
and got trapped.

00:26:06.593 --> 00:26:07.113
How are

00:26:07.113 --> 00:26:08.034
the others doing?

00:26:08.074 --> 00:26:08.833
Calm down.

00:26:09.554 --> 00:26:10.714
I bet Immortal Bo Yuan

00:26:10.833 --> 00:26:12.074
has some serious issues.

00:26:12.554 --> 00:26:13.994
Let's look around

00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:15.113
and see if we can

00:26:15.113 --> 00:26:15.754
get out.

00:26:26.954 --> 00:26:28.433
What's going on?

00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:30.474
How did I get here?

00:26:33.514 --> 00:26:34.514
Ouch.

00:26:35.153 --> 00:26:36.514
It's not a dream.

00:26:37.274 --> 00:26:38.113
Wasn't I just

00:26:38.113 --> 00:26:39.633
studying with Huan Zong?

00:26:41.994 --> 00:26:42.833
Get up.

00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:44.153
Huan Zong?

00:26:44.314 --> 00:26:44.994
Weren't we

00:26:44.994 --> 00:26:46.833
studying at Immortal Bo Yuan's place?

00:26:46.913 --> 00:26:48.034
How did we get here?

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.314
This is all your fault.

00:26:51.514 --> 00:26:53.514
You dozed off while studying.

00:26:53.593 --> 00:26:55.633
How can you accompany me
through secret realms?

00:26:55.994 --> 00:26:57.034
Listen up.

00:26:57.034 --> 00:26:58.353
You'd better go home.

00:26:58.514 --> 00:26:59.393
Don't hold me back.

00:26:59.474 --> 00:27:00.913
What do you mean?

00:27:01.034 --> 00:27:02.794
You kicked me out of the secret realm?

00:27:03.234 --> 00:27:04.593
Of course, I did.

00:27:04.754 --> 00:27:06.593
But you're mostly to blame.

00:27:07.193 --> 00:27:08.074
Well,

00:27:08.074 --> 00:27:09.754
I've never seen such a talentless

00:27:09.754 --> 00:27:11.314
mediocre cultivator

00:27:11.954 --> 00:27:12.754
like you.

00:27:12.913 --> 00:27:14.234
You'd better go home.

00:27:14.234 --> 00:27:15.314
Don't embarrass your sect.

00:27:15.314 --> 00:27:15.913
You...

00:27:16.633 --> 00:27:17.554
I merely

00:27:17.554 --> 00:27:18.833
nodded off

00:27:18.994 --> 00:27:20.673
while reading.

00:27:20.714 --> 00:27:22.274
Why are you so harsh?

00:27:22.633 --> 00:27:23.633
Besides,

00:27:23.754 --> 00:27:25.193
I've always been

00:27:25.314 --> 00:27:26.833
poor at studying.

00:27:26.994 --> 00:27:28.274
I'm trying my hardest.

00:27:28.274 --> 00:27:29.554
You're trying your hardest?

00:27:29.754 --> 00:27:31.393
Struggling to read a book?

00:27:31.393 --> 00:27:32.153
How stupid

00:27:32.153 --> 00:27:33.393
are you?

00:27:33.593 --> 00:27:34.714
All the cultivators

00:27:34.714 --> 00:27:35.833
in the Lingyou Realm

00:27:35.873 --> 00:27:37.314
work harder than you.

00:27:37.714 --> 00:27:38.754
But I...

00:27:38.754 --> 00:27:40.353
But what? No excuses.

00:27:40.353 --> 00:27:42.034
Stop blabbering. Get going.

00:27:42.754 --> 00:27:43.873
Wait.

00:27:44.314 --> 00:27:45.873
Since when did you

00:27:46.034 --> 00:27:47.514
become so talkative?

00:27:47.794 --> 00:27:48.673
And

00:27:48.913 --> 00:27:49.833
you've never spoken

00:27:49.833 --> 00:27:51.034
like this before.

00:27:58.314 --> 00:27:59.314
Haven't I...

00:27:59.833 --> 00:28:01.193
Haven't I always been like this?

00:28:04.153 --> 00:28:04.873
No.

00:28:05.193 --> 00:28:06.714
You're not Huan Zong.

00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:08.994
Don't you dare say that.

00:28:09.074 --> 00:28:10.593
Who am I if I'm not Huan Zong?

00:28:10.754 --> 00:28:12.353
When Huan Zong speaks to me,

00:28:12.393 --> 00:28:13.913
he's never so...

00:28:14.954 --> 00:28:15.954
Besides,

00:28:16.234 --> 00:28:17.474
even if I'm slow

00:28:17.673 --> 00:28:18.994
and often make mistakes,

00:28:19.153 --> 00:28:20.193
Huan Zong

00:28:20.193 --> 00:28:21.593
never looks down on me.

00:28:22.153 --> 00:28:23.514
When I'm with him,

00:28:23.593 --> 00:28:24.673
I always feel

00:28:24.714 --> 00:28:26.153
very secure.

00:28:28.633 --> 00:28:30.353
So cheesy.

00:28:35.034 --> 00:28:36.873
Now I get it.

00:28:37.074 --> 00:28:37.954
What did you get?

00:28:38.034 --> 00:28:40.074
Immortal Bo Yuan sent you

00:28:40.074 --> 00:28:42.514
to test me.

00:28:43.074 --> 00:28:44.514
I knew

00:28:44.673 --> 00:28:46.193
Immortal Bo Yuan wouldn't let us out

00:28:46.193 --> 00:28:47.514
by just memorizing

00:28:47.514 --> 00:28:48.593
some texts.

00:28:49.474 --> 00:28:50.113
Tell me.

00:28:50.193 --> 00:28:51.274
Did you do the same

00:28:51.274 --> 00:28:52.274
to Huan Zong?

00:28:52.474 --> 00:28:53.714
He's pure of heart.

00:28:53.794 --> 00:28:55.234
Don't you bully him.

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:57.353
You spout such cheesy lines

00:28:57.833 --> 00:28:59.474
so smoothly. Eww.

00:29:00.353 --> 00:29:01.514
Where is he?

00:29:01.554 --> 00:29:02.794
What did you do to him?

00:29:03.113 --> 00:29:03.754
And

00:29:04.074 --> 00:29:06.474
who are you?

00:29:08.274 --> 00:29:09.593
Clever girl.

00:29:09.913 --> 00:29:11.554
Who I am doesn't matter.

00:29:11.714 --> 00:29:12.833
What matters is

00:29:12.873 --> 00:29:14.593
that I'm here to test you two.

00:29:15.474 --> 00:29:16.393
And let me remind you.

00:29:16.593 --> 00:29:17.234
That guy

00:29:17.234 --> 00:29:18.913
is way smarter than you think.

00:29:19.833 --> 00:29:20.794
So,

00:29:20.954 --> 00:29:22.794
I passed your test?

00:29:24.754 --> 00:29:25.353
When can I

00:29:25.353 --> 00:29:26.234
see him, then?

00:29:26.913 --> 00:29:28.193
You're so...

00:29:29.433 --> 00:29:31.314
Never mind. Too bothered to explain.

00:29:31.393 --> 00:29:32.193
Anyway,

00:29:32.593 --> 00:29:33.913
you passed this test.

00:29:33.913 --> 00:29:34.673
Therefore,

00:29:34.994 --> 00:29:36.314
get lost now.

00:29:41.393 --> 00:29:42.274
Well?

00:29:42.353 --> 00:29:43.353
Found anything?

00:29:43.514 --> 00:29:44.554
Nothing at all.

00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:45.833
Just filth everywhere.

00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:48.890
(Stele Inscription)

00:29:50.314 --> 00:29:51.074
Over there.

00:29:55.034 --> 00:29:57.314
I slaughtered
countless demon cultivators

00:29:57.393 --> 00:29:59.074
and captured the rest.

00:29:59.074 --> 00:30:01.754
Their souls were sealed here,

00:30:01.954 --> 00:30:03.314
guarded by this stele.

00:30:03.353 --> 00:30:05.074
The strong demonic aura
made this mansion

00:30:05.074 --> 00:30:06.193
inhabitable.

00:30:06.393 --> 00:30:08.353
Thus, I repurposed it
as a containment site

00:30:08.353 --> 00:30:10.514
to house passing demonic creatures.

00:30:12.673 --> 00:30:14.314
So Immortal Bo Yuan

00:30:14.314 --> 00:30:15.794
houses demonic creatures here?

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:17.393
Demonic creatures?

00:30:18.234 --> 00:30:20.193
But I'm not a demon cultivator.

00:30:20.314 --> 00:30:22.593
Why am I here then?

00:30:23.794 --> 00:30:25.554
He keeps saying "demonic creatures".

00:30:25.633 --> 00:30:27.034
Not all demon cultivators are evil.

00:30:27.113 --> 00:30:28.153
I haven't even

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:29.593
eaten a chicken.

00:30:29.593 --> 00:30:31.193
I only eat spiritual fruits.

00:30:31.234 --> 00:30:32.274
What else does he want?

00:30:35.673 --> 00:30:36.873
So this is why

00:30:36.873 --> 00:30:38.314
I got pulled in here.

00:30:39.353 --> 00:30:40.234
Ling Bo.

00:30:44.274 --> 00:30:44.994
Am I right?

00:30:45.034 --> 00:30:45.873
You heard me.

00:30:52.794 --> 00:30:53.433
I...

00:30:53.514 --> 00:30:54.714
I don't know how

00:30:54.714 --> 00:30:56.234
I became like this.

00:30:56.314 --> 00:30:57.314
You know what?

00:30:57.514 --> 00:30:59.074
These little ears

00:30:59.193 --> 00:31:00.554
look quite charming on you.

00:31:00.593 --> 00:31:02.393
See? All fluffy.

00:31:02.554 --> 00:31:03.353
Adorable.

00:31:08.794 --> 00:31:10.554
Is it because of this mark?

00:31:10.633 --> 00:31:12.274
Our bloodlines merged.

00:31:12.474 --> 00:31:13.113
Plus the intense

00:31:13.113 --> 00:31:14.433
demonic aura here.

00:31:14.433 --> 00:31:15.193
That's why

00:31:15.193 --> 00:31:16.153
I became like this.

00:31:23.994 --> 00:31:25.193
Maybe...

00:31:25.593 --> 00:31:26.593
Maybe?

00:31:27.714 --> 00:31:28.673
Probably...

00:31:28.794 --> 00:31:30.074
Probably?

00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:32.794
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps?

00:31:32.873 --> 00:31:33.954
Perhaps, that's why.

00:31:34.074 --> 00:31:35.353
Lin Hu, you lousy fox.

00:31:35.353 --> 00:31:36.193
I'll kill you!

00:31:36.193 --> 00:31:37.314
Wait.

00:31:37.433 --> 00:31:38.913
I-I don't know

00:31:38.913 --> 00:31:39.913
what happened.

00:31:40.074 --> 00:31:41.353
If you really turn into a fox,

00:31:41.353 --> 00:31:42.393
you'll be

00:31:42.393 --> 00:31:43.474
the prettiest fox among us.

00:31:43.514 --> 00:31:44.474
Who wants to be a fox?

00:31:44.474 --> 00:31:45.714
I'm a Zhaohan Sect disciple.

00:31:45.714 --> 00:31:46.274
How dare you

00:31:46.274 --> 00:31:47.514
demon cultivator bully me?

00:31:47.593 --> 00:31:48.873
- Stop.
- Don't...

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:49.474
How dare you

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:50.393
bully me?

00:31:50.393 --> 00:31:51.074
I dare not.

00:31:51.074 --> 00:31:51.714
Stop running.

00:31:51.714 --> 00:31:52.593
Lady Ling Bo, wait.

00:31:52.673 --> 00:31:53.633
Calm down, will you?

00:31:53.673 --> 00:31:54.833
Let me explain.

00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:56.234
Trying to escape?

00:31:56.353 --> 00:31:56.913
I...

00:32:00.153 --> 00:32:00.794
What's wrong?

00:32:01.274 --> 00:32:02.074
Are you okay?

00:32:04.034 --> 00:32:04.554
I...

00:32:04.994 --> 00:32:06.754
I swear I don't know what happened.

00:32:06.913 --> 00:32:08.353
If you're still angry,

00:32:08.433 --> 00:32:09.673
beat me up.

00:32:19.554 --> 00:32:20.514
I've never

00:32:20.833 --> 00:32:22.633
formed a demon mark before.

00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:26.113
This is my f-first time.

00:32:26.113 --> 00:32:26.833
I swear.

00:32:28.153 --> 00:32:29.314
This is my first time.

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:30.833
It's my first time.

00:32:31.034 --> 00:32:32.234
Don't be upset.

00:32:32.873 --> 00:32:34.193
Worst-case scenario,

00:32:35.074 --> 00:32:36.433
I'll undo it for you.

00:32:37.074 --> 00:32:38.153
Undo it?

00:32:39.954 --> 00:32:42.193
Didn't you say you couldn't undo it?

00:33:02.633 --> 00:33:03.994
This is unbearable.

00:33:06.833 --> 00:33:07.994
Hang in there.

00:33:31.714 --> 00:33:32.673
It must have

00:33:32.673 --> 00:33:34.314
drained much of your spiritual energy.

00:33:34.474 --> 00:33:35.554
Are you alright?

00:33:37.074 --> 00:33:38.034
I'm fine.

00:33:38.474 --> 00:33:39.994
I'm at least a Nascent Soul.

00:33:39.994 --> 00:33:41.193
This is nothing.

00:33:41.514 --> 00:33:42.433
Are you leaving?

00:33:43.954 --> 00:33:45.074
What will you do

00:33:45.074 --> 00:33:45.714
if I leave?

00:33:45.714 --> 00:33:46.554
How do you get out?

00:33:46.873 --> 00:33:47.994
Don't worry.

00:33:47.994 --> 00:33:48.954
Young Master

00:33:48.954 --> 00:33:50.074
will definitely find me.

00:33:50.633 --> 00:33:51.353
Yeah.

00:33:51.554 --> 00:33:52.433
I'll ask your

00:33:52.433 --> 00:33:53.673
Young Master to help...

00:33:53.673 --> 00:33:55.034
With what?

00:33:55.034 --> 00:33:56.153
Why are you so nagging?

00:33:56.153 --> 00:33:57.074
Are you leaving or not?

00:33:57.074 --> 00:33:58.593
Leave before I change my mind.

00:34:02.794 --> 00:34:04.234
She just left like that,

00:34:04.514 --> 00:34:05.274
leaving me alone

00:34:05.274 --> 00:34:07.034
in this demon cultivator's tomb.

00:34:07.193 --> 00:34:07.833
Women.

00:34:07.913 --> 00:34:09.153
Women are ruthless.

00:34:13.753 --> 00:34:14.834
Why did you come back?

00:34:19.874 --> 00:34:21.074
I mean,

00:34:21.074 --> 00:34:23.074
you suddenly returned and startled me.

00:34:23.354 --> 00:34:24.874
You were too absorbed

00:34:24.874 --> 00:34:26.673
in muttering to yourself.

00:34:28.153 --> 00:34:29.633
Why did you come back?

00:34:31.753 --> 00:34:33.153
I can't get out.

00:34:33.394 --> 00:34:34.554
No way.

00:34:38.113 --> 00:34:39.153
I see, though we undo

00:34:39.153 --> 00:34:39.874
the demon mark,

00:34:39.874 --> 00:34:40.713
you still carry

00:34:40.713 --> 00:34:41.514
some demonic aura.

00:34:41.994 --> 00:34:43.273
What should we do then?

00:34:44.834 --> 00:34:45.874
I have an idea.

00:34:46.034 --> 00:34:46.753
Reestablish

00:34:46.753 --> 00:34:48.273
the demon mark connection,

00:34:48.354 --> 00:34:49.633
then I'll draw out

00:34:49.633 --> 00:34:50.313
the demonic aura.

00:34:51.233 --> 00:34:52.474
Stop lying to me.

00:34:52.954 --> 00:34:54.793
I'm not lying. It's your call.

00:34:54.834 --> 00:34:55.354
Stay and wait

00:34:55.354 --> 00:34:56.354
for it to fade

00:34:56.354 --> 00:34:57.354
if you want.

00:34:58.793 --> 00:35:00.673
How long will that take?

00:35:01.954 --> 00:35:02.554
Forget it.

00:35:02.994 --> 00:35:04.474
It'll be dark soon.

00:35:04.593 --> 00:35:06.193
The secret realm gets terrifying.

00:35:06.593 --> 00:35:07.593
Why don't you

00:35:07.593 --> 00:35:08.554
sleep here tonight?

00:35:08.554 --> 00:35:10.074
You're safer close to me.

00:35:10.354 --> 00:35:11.394
Rest assured.

00:35:11.394 --> 00:35:12.233
At dawn tomorrow,

00:35:12.313 --> 00:35:12.874
it might

00:35:12.874 --> 00:35:14.193
have dissipated.

00:35:22.034 --> 00:35:22.834
Chi.

00:35:23.074 --> 00:35:24.233
Thank you so much.

00:35:25.313 --> 00:35:26.554
Don't mention it.

00:35:26.954 --> 00:35:28.554
Cultivators should support each other.

00:35:28.554 --> 00:35:29.273
It's only proper.

00:35:31.233 --> 00:35:32.954
Thanks to your profound cultivation,

00:35:33.034 --> 00:35:34.313
we broke the formation

00:35:34.394 --> 00:35:35.313
and found Jin Ling.

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:37.354
You flatter me.

00:35:38.193 --> 00:35:39.034
Zhou Xiao.

00:35:39.074 --> 00:35:40.313
It took you so long

00:35:40.354 --> 00:35:41.914
to break a simple formation?

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:44.554
Shame on me.

00:35:45.313 --> 00:35:45.994
I was

00:35:46.074 --> 00:35:47.193
merely lucky

00:35:47.193 --> 00:35:48.113
and stumbled upon

00:35:48.153 --> 00:35:49.153
the exit.

00:35:49.793 --> 00:35:51.394
Right, Lady Jin Ling.

00:35:51.434 --> 00:35:52.713
Did you happen to see

00:35:52.874 --> 00:35:53.834
any unusual items

00:35:53.834 --> 00:35:54.713
down there?

00:35:54.793 --> 00:35:56.753
They say that
Immortal Bo Yuan hides treasures

00:35:56.954 --> 00:35:58.793
behind every mechanism.

00:35:59.434 --> 00:36:00.153
Yeah.

00:36:00.273 --> 00:36:00.834
I discovered

00:36:00.834 --> 00:36:01.994
a treasure chest

00:36:01.994 --> 00:36:02.793
and brought

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:03.753
everything back.

00:36:10.298 --> 00:36:11.616
(Heaven and Earth Swordplay)

00:36:13.753 --> 00:36:16.273
- Heaven and Earth Swordplay!
- Is it a powerful technique?

00:36:16.753 --> 00:36:18.233
They say this swordplay

00:36:18.273 --> 00:36:19.313
was created by

00:36:19.313 --> 00:36:21.113
an ascended sword cultivator
3,000 years ago,

00:36:21.313 --> 00:36:22.994
featuring the pinnacle of swordplay.

00:36:23.193 --> 00:36:24.313
Whoever masters it

00:36:24.474 --> 00:36:26.113
can overturn the Heaven

00:36:26.113 --> 00:36:27.153
and Earth.

00:36:27.233 --> 00:36:29.034
But the sword cultivator ascended

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:30.834
and his sword manual got lost.

00:36:31.034 --> 00:36:31.793
What remains

00:36:31.793 --> 00:36:32.713
are merely legends

00:36:32.713 --> 00:36:33.593
of the swordplay.

00:36:33.834 --> 00:36:35.074
They say whoever obtains it

00:36:35.113 --> 00:36:36.994
will gain fame across the realm

00:36:37.034 --> 00:36:38.994
and ascend to immortality.

00:36:39.633 --> 00:36:40.673
Zhou Xiao.

00:36:50.713 --> 00:36:52.034
Please accept this manual

00:36:52.074 --> 00:36:53.673
as a token of gratitude.

00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:54.673
I, Chi Si,

00:36:54.673 --> 00:36:56.074
have never been one for greed.

00:36:56.074 --> 00:36:56.753
I think

00:36:56.793 --> 00:36:57.673
we should

00:36:57.673 --> 00:36:58.554
study it together.

00:36:58.633 --> 00:36:59.914
Besides, you discovered

00:36:59.914 --> 00:37:01.354
this sword manual.

00:37:01.713 --> 00:37:03.834
You are truly magnanimous.

00:37:05.354 --> 00:37:06.233
Alright then.

00:37:06.313 --> 00:37:07.753
I'll make thousands of copies

00:37:07.753 --> 00:37:08.914
of this manual

00:37:08.914 --> 00:37:09.713
and deliver them

00:37:09.713 --> 00:37:10.793
to every major sect.

00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:14.793
This mirror

00:37:14.874 --> 00:37:16.474
is placed alongside the manual.

00:37:16.514 --> 00:37:18.273
I bet there's something to it.

00:37:18.474 --> 00:37:19.793
Here's what you didn't know.

00:37:19.914 --> 00:37:20.874
This mirror

00:37:20.874 --> 00:37:21.673
is remarkable.

00:37:21.753 --> 00:37:23.074
It reveals one's past.

00:37:23.354 --> 00:37:24.394
Care to try it?

00:37:24.914 --> 00:37:26.313
No need.

00:37:26.514 --> 00:37:28.313
Zhou Xiao, why don't you try it?

00:37:28.374 --> 00:37:28.874
Zhou Xiao.

00:37:28.874 --> 00:37:29.593
No need.

00:37:29.593 --> 00:37:30.233
Zhou Xiao.

00:37:30.233 --> 00:37:31.793
I just want to know you better.

00:37:31.793 --> 00:37:32.474
Look into it.

00:37:32.673 --> 00:37:33.394
Try it, please.

00:37:33.394 --> 00:37:34.074
No, thank you.

00:37:34.713 --> 00:37:35.434
Ling Bo.

00:37:35.673 --> 00:37:37.034
I've cleaned the room for you.

00:37:37.093 --> 00:37:37.593
You can

00:37:37.593 --> 00:37:38.633
rest there tonight.

00:37:40.874 --> 00:37:41.434
Here.

00:37:45.113 --> 00:37:46.074
Eat.

00:37:55.793 --> 00:37:57.313
What's wrong? You don't like it?

00:37:57.313 --> 00:37:59.313
I don't want it. I have no appetite.

00:37:59.834 --> 00:38:00.673
You don't want it?

00:38:00.753 --> 00:38:01.793
What do you want then?

00:38:03.434 --> 00:38:04.874
I want

00:38:05.313 --> 00:38:06.753
something bloody,

00:38:07.954 --> 00:38:09.034
dripping wet,

00:38:09.233 --> 00:38:10.273
with bones...

00:38:10.753 --> 00:38:11.593
Chicken drumsticks.

00:38:12.673 --> 00:38:13.313
You...

00:38:13.554 --> 00:38:15.273
You've grown so much like a fox.

00:38:21.153 --> 00:38:22.034
I-I didn't...

00:38:22.354 --> 00:38:22.994
Ling Bo.

00:38:23.153 --> 00:38:24.753
That's not what I meant.

00:38:26.834 --> 00:38:28.593
I meant no offense.

00:38:37.074 --> 00:38:37.834
Well,

00:38:37.954 --> 00:38:39.074
a wild goose

00:38:39.074 --> 00:38:40.113
flew by.

00:38:40.193 --> 00:38:41.954
I caught it and grilled it for you.

00:38:42.113 --> 00:38:43.713
I-I left it there.

00:38:44.193 --> 00:38:45.753
Just have it.

00:38:46.514 --> 00:38:48.753
Be it chicken or goose

00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:49.633
drumsticks,

00:38:49.633 --> 00:38:50.593
it's fine to indulge.

00:38:50.793 --> 00:38:52.313
Many cultivators

00:38:52.313 --> 00:38:53.713
don't practice fasting.

00:38:53.793 --> 00:38:54.874
The Yunhua Sect members

00:38:54.954 --> 00:38:56.354
consume all manner of delicacies

00:38:56.354 --> 00:38:57.874
from sky to land

00:38:57.874 --> 00:38:59.074
without consequence.

00:38:59.153 --> 00:38:59.874
Actually,

00:38:59.874 --> 00:39:01.193
demon cultivators

00:39:01.193 --> 00:39:02.113
aren't as terrible

00:39:02.113 --> 00:39:03.193
as you imagine.

00:39:07.954 --> 00:39:08.994
I won't eat.

00:39:10.593 --> 00:39:12.113
Come on.

00:39:12.273 --> 00:39:13.153
If you don't eat,

00:39:13.153 --> 00:39:14.874
I'll feel terrible.

00:39:15.313 --> 00:39:16.793
I understand the craving

00:39:16.793 --> 00:39:17.994
for raw flesh

00:39:17.994 --> 00:39:19.793
when a demonic aura possesses you.

00:39:19.914 --> 00:39:21.113
Don't suppress it.

00:39:21.193 --> 00:39:22.233
Suppressing it

00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:23.753
only worsens the agitation.

00:39:23.793 --> 00:39:25.313
Just relax and eat.

00:39:25.313 --> 00:39:26.354
After that,

00:39:26.354 --> 00:39:27.713
we'll leave this cursed place.

00:39:27.713 --> 00:39:28.633
I'll take this secret

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:29.593
to my grave.

00:39:29.593 --> 00:39:30.153
Alright?

00:39:30.673 --> 00:39:32.233
Once the demonic aura dissipates,

00:39:32.313 --> 00:39:34.713
you're still the gorgeous, elegant,

00:39:34.713 --> 00:39:36.313
generous, highly cultivated,

00:39:36.313 --> 00:39:37.474
and noble Lady Ling Bo.

00:39:37.474 --> 00:39:38.113
Right?

00:39:56.554 --> 00:39:58.593
It's windy outside. Rest inside.
