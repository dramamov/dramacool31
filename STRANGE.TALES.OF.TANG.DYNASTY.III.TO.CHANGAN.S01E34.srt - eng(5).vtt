[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.970
[Episode 34]

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.240
Zhong Shizai,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.150
what other crimes have you committed?

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.350
Confess truthfully!

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.360
I haven't!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.660
Mr. Geng already anticipated

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.039
you would say that.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.180
When I first saw him back then,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.060
he was covered in blood,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.220
with multiple wounds on his body.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.710
It was clear that these injuries

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.940
resulted from violent fights with others.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.400
[Speak and Seek Truth]

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.460
My wife passed away many years ago...

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.740
and left me with no children.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.310
Zhong Shizai was the first disciple

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.590
I ever took in.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.750
I treated him

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.630
like my own son,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.550
caring for him and teaching him.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.180
But eventually, I discovered

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.560
he wasn't suited to be a coroner.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.570
It's because he killed people
when he was young.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.040
In our line of work,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.950
we constantly deal with corpses

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.120
and murder weapons.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.160
What we see and perceive

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.120
can also stir up

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.190
the desire to kill within us.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.110
Now you understand

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.170
why Mr. Geng had to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280
expel you from his tutelage, right?

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.960
Zhong Shizai's skills as a coroner

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.550
may rank

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.750
[Speak and Seek Truth]

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.220
among the top in Chang'an,

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.000
but he's far from securing

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.290
a top-three position.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.440
He is extremely shrewd

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.450
and excels at using others' strengths
against them.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.500
[Speak and Seek Truth]

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.280
He's even better at
employing deceitful schemes.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.990
Therefore,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.380
when I discovered that Dong Yue's death

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.960
wasn't as simple as it appeared,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.150
I began to suspect him.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.350
He thought

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.280
that by eliminating
Coroners Dong and Zheng with one scheme,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.220
he could ensure

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.090
his place among the top three.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.310
I lied and said

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.060
that I'd participate in
the Coroners' Contest myself,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.790
and I wrote this in advance...

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.570
waiting for him to come.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.970
"If I'm murdered,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.110
the killer is Zhong Shizai."

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.240
You anticipated everything beforehand.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.520
I taught him myself.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.400
I'm deeply ashamed.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.570
I was once a servant,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.710
but was fortunate enough

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.500
to study and practice martial arts
alongside my young master.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.370
The young master was dull-witted,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.180
or rather, he was a fool.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.510
Whether it was reading and writing

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.120
or horsemanship and combat skills,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.320
he was inferior to me!

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.680
The master became angry because of this

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.830
and often beat and scolded me
to vent his frustration.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.260
I could only endure it

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.770
in order to continue my studies.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040
But my endurance

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.390
did not earn me kind treatment.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.720
The master became increasingly cruel

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.310
and nearly beat me to death several times!

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.620
I couldn't bear it anymore,

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.630
so I killed all three members
of that family

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.030
and disguised it as a night raid
by bandits!

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.390
I wounded myself as well

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.180
to deceive the constables

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.159
and escape.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.750
That is how I've survived until today.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.900
My mentor was right.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.690
I've long been weary of

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.080
being a coroner.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.660
Because every time I see a corpse,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.170
a murder weapon,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.570
or a murder scene,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.160
I'm reminded of

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.120
who I once was.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.560
Sheriff Su!

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.780
Sheriff Su!

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.720
There's been a beheading case.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.030
The victim is a young woman—

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.430
head and body separated!

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.159
Is an autopsy necessary?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.900
Coroner Zhong Shizai is here!

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.380
Shame...

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.890
I won't have a chance

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.200
to perform an autopsy again.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.120
Fortunately, we didn't ask Xijun to come.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.820
Sheriff Su,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.280
there are no more coroners available.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.340
Go invite Mr. Geng.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.500
Tell him I sent you.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:37.430
Yes, sir.

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:44.390
Sheriff Su has just taken office.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.120
Please do him this favor.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.680
It's not that I don't want to help,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.240
but as you can see, I'm old and sick.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.720
I really can't leave home anymore.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.880
Well...

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.530
Suchan,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.980
go with Captain Xu.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.600
Tell them you'll examine the body
on my behalf,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.310
and ask Sheriff Su if he would permit it.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.680
What?

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.070
Haven't you always wanted

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.770
to become a coroner yourself?

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.270
But I'm a woman.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.910
Can I really be a coroner?

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.360
A woman examining a female corpse

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.360
is more convenient than a man doing so.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.950
Besides,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.860
Su Wuming is Master Di's disciple,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.070
so he won't be bound
by outdated conventions.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.500
Perhaps this is your chance.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.360
Take my autopsy kit

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.480
and go.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.070
Go.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.870
I...

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.430
I've never examined a corpse before.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.360
There's a first time for everyone.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.680
Please proceed.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:51.600
Sheriff Su, you're really allowing me
to examine the body?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.310
Since Mr. Geng sent you here,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.090
you must have learned his skills well.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.800
Also,

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.370
Yingtao can keep a record for you.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.330
In that case, thank you for your help.

The skin below the neck is contracted.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.610
Both sides
of the cervical vertebrae protrude.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.750
There are spatter-pattern bloodstains
in the surrounding area.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.640
These indicate that the victim was hacked
while still alive.

[Autopsy Record]

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.020
The head lies four feet
to the right of the shoulders.

[Autopsy Record]

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.690
The severed surface of the head is clean

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.490
and can be aligned with the body.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.630
Therefore, I deduce

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.360
it was likely

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.580
cut off by a sharp weapon
such as a sword or knife,

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.600
and the killing was accomplished
with a single strike.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.080
We should immediately find the relatives

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.140
and ensure the head

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.120
and body belong to the same person.

The time of death.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.140
Judging from the wound,
it should be around 9-11 PM,

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.950
no later than midnight.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.200
Sheriff Su,

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.200
I don't know

what else needs to be examined.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.320
You've examined it thoroughly,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.480
with clear reasoning

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.620
and accurate judgment.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.490
You will surely be able to inherit

Yes, sir.

As the coroner suggested,

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.480
find the deceased's relatives immediately.

Today, Coroner Suchan

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.240
shall receive the highest autopsy fee.

Furthermore,

in the future, the county office

may call upon Suchan

whenever a coroner is needed.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:35.970
Yes, sir.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.810
Suchan, well done.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.630
Your examination was just as thorough

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.700
as Sheriff Su's.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.080
Congratulations on becoming
a female coroner.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.670
Actually, you're not the first.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.000
We've met more than

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.670
one female coroner before

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.730
in Shiyang County.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.590
So, you're not alone.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.400
You've seen the body now.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.450
Can you confirm the identity?

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.600
It's my daughter!

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.600
She was fine yesterday.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.670
It's all your fault.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.720
When our daughter picked up
that cursed money,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.270
you should have thrown it away!

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.240
But you!

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.390
You thought it was a blessing!

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.240
Found some money?

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.030
Mother, look.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.630
-Who lost it?
-Well...

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.510
Who...

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.390
Who dropped this pouch?

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.260
Not mine.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.410
That's not mine.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.560
Quick, count them.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:42.310
[One]

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.760
[One]

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.460
Have you seen a money pouch?

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.490
About this big

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.490
and red in color.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.050
Haven't seen it.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.850
Never seen it.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.440
We haven't been to

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.390
the crossroads today.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.630
Right, haven't been there lately.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.440
Sheriff Su,

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.200
we've asked around all the nearby streets.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.790
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.360
I've heard of people losing money,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.660
but I've never heard of anyone
admitting they found it.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.390
If such good fortune really happened,

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.920
no one would speak of it openly.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.870
-Yeah.
-Right.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.030
Have any of you seen this pouch before?

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.790
Everyone, come and take a look!

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.270
Have you seen this red pouch?

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.200
-No.
-No.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.150
Haven't seen it.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.270
Senior Yin!

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.860
You were scared, right?

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.550
It's made of wood.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.480
When I have free time,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.340
I practice my makeup skills on it.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.180
Look at this place.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.470
It hardly looks like a home anymore.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.970
You can admit it now.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.030
You stopped being a coroner

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.430
and moved out of the house

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.290
because you were jealous

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.240
that Father treated Senior Shizai
better than you.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.630
Back then, both the Ministry of Justice

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.200
and the Court of Judicial Review
asked Father for a coroner.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.510
Father recommended Senior Shizai,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.340
not you.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.290
Are you still angry at Father for that?

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.420
It's all in the past.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.600
Come have a bowl of soup.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.790
The Three-Fruit Bone Broth

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.050
that I made myself.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.600
Isn't that the famous broth
from the West Market?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.960
The one that nobles drink?

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.600
You can actually make it at home?

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.840
What's so difficult about that?

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.150
You just need to boil juice from Terminalia chebula,

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.750
Phyllanthus emblica,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.390
and Terminalia bellirica,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.320
and then cook it with pork bones.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.150
Then I must try it.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.320
Here.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.670
It's really good.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.670
I have some good news

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.360
to tell you.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.120
Early this morning, I heard

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.670
that Senior Shizai was arrested
by the county office.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.070
I feel terrible about it.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.360
What good news could there possibly be?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.030
Indeed.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.000
Compared to
what happened to Senior Shizai,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.390
whether I become a coroner or not

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.250
doesn't seem important anymore.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.230
You're going to be a coroner?

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.810
Sheriff Su permitted it.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.750
I examined

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.410
a decapitated female corpse.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.310
I don't know

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.570
whether I should be happy for you or...

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.370
Why wouldn't you be happy for me?

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.360
The work of a coroner is steeped in death.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.560
You're a young woman.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.440
It's not suitable.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.410
But I've been waiting for this day

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.590
for so long.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.270
Senior Yin, you don't know.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.400
Since you moved out,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.480
Father has been teaching me

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.280
the autopsy formulas every day.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.870
You've been studying autopsy
for three years now?

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:40.440
Yeah.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.550
Although I've studied for three years,

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.480
Father often scolds me for being stupid.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.720
Because in his heart,

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.050
the most talented one is you, Senior Yin.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.060
I can see

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.550
how deeply saddened Father is

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.840
over Senior Shizai.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.700
So I came today

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.000
to ask you

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.550
to return to the coroner's trade.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.360
Isn't there going to be

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.390
a Coroners' Contest?

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.750
You're the best, Senior Yin.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.440
You'll definitely win first place.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:05.970
That way,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.600
you can serve in the county office,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.360
and Father will surely be proud of you.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.420
I'll become

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.080
the best mortician

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.340
in all of Chang'an too.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.960
I'll visit our mentor often.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.770
May he live a long and healthy life.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.320
Well, I must go now.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.320
Before you came,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.840
someone just asked for my services

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.750
to apply makeup to a deceased person.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.790
They said it was a violent death.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:29.920
The head was cut off.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.360
I wonder

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.530
if it's the same body you examined.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.180
Suchan,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.930
thank you for the soup.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.170
It's delicious.

[Funeral]

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.780
You're the mortician, right?

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.790
The passing ceremony,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.880
soul-calling ceremony,

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.750
and changing of clothes for my daughter

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.150
have all been completed.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.240
Once you apply her makeup,

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.720
she can be placed in the coffin.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.320
No rush.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.480
"Through solemn rites,
we mourn the nation's sorrows;

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.440
through funeral rites, we mourn death."

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.390
Nothing in funeral rituals
should be omitted.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.910
Before applying the final makeup,

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.000
our morticians have certain rituals
to perform.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.720
The tradition of burial camphorwood dolls
began with Yu Qing,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.520
burial garments with Zuo Botao,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.840
and funeral songs
with the rope-pullers' chants.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.500
The ritual of mortuary makeup

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.260
shall begin with me, Yin Yao.

out the back door

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.080
is where the crime occurred.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.960
Given that the deceased's chamber

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.690
is next to her parents',

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.410
that they

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.430
heard no sounds,

and that there are no signs

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.790
of struggle or scratches
on the deceased's body,

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:45.790
we can conclude

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.800
she was not forced out by any intruder;

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.120
rather, she

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.690
left voluntarily.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.560
What exactly did she see?

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.270
They say the courtyard
where the deceased was found

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.200
has been abandoned for many years.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.440
It's rumored to be haunted.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.030
Neighbors never go there.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.550
Going there in the dead of night—

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.280
wasn't she asking for trouble?

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.950
Respect the dead. Don't speak carelessly.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.440

Don't be like this.

made my daughter look so beautiful.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.310
How can I ever thank you enough?

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.810
It's simply my duty as a mortician.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.130
No need to thank me.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.570
And your payment...

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.690
I remember you mentioned

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.590
50 coins.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.610
You think... that's too much?

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.310
No, no.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.940
I think it's too little.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.640
This is the proper price
for funeral services?

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.590
This is the price.

is itself a virtuous deed.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.510
Charging you 50 coins

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.640
is just to cover the cost of rouge,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.680
white lead powder, and other materials.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.440
In that case,

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:05.260
I bow to you on behalf of my daughter!

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.800
The makeup is truly wonderful.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I didn't expect to

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.720
run into you here again, Sheriff Su.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.250
The case remains unsolved.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.640
I'm here for a routine investigation.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.000
Have you found any leads?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.110
Not yet.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.030
However, having witnessed it today,

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.930
I now have a deeper understanding

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.400
of the significance of your work.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.390
Earlier, I was thinking

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.110
of persuading you to go back
to being a coroner.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.030
But now I see

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.670
that's no longer necessary.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.460
Thank you, Sheriff Su.

Business at Sushan Shop
has been good lately.

By the end of the month,
we can divide the profits again.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.150

shamelessly take a share?

Besides,

the salary from Yongzhou Prefecture
is quite generous.

Without my help,

being county sheriff

It belonged to a beheading victim.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.020
Did the murdered person

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.530
pick it up at a crossroads?

Mr. Fei, how did you know?

This is a life-borrowing pouch
that someone left behind.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.240
It's used for
borrowing someone else's lifespan.

Whose money pouch is this?

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.570
This happens often in the Ghost Market.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.430
When someone is about to die

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.140
and their loved ones desperately

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.690
want to make them live longer,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.170
they put money in life-borrowing pouches

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.260
and leave them at various crossroads.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.720
If someone picks up the money,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.990
it's as if they've lent their lifespan

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.030
to the dying person.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.510
But killing the person
who picks up the money—

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.720
that's not borrowing lifespan.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.270
That's stealing lifespan.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.720
Even in the Ghost Market,
such acts are extremely rare.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.510
So, this character "one" means

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.480
borrowing one year of life?

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.610
That depends on how seriously ill

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.320
the dying person is.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.990
If the illness is severe,

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.070
it might mean

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.420
borrowing only one day.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.290
Killing one person
to borrow one day of life?

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.480
That's too cruel.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.790
The person who wrote this character

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.450
may be skilled with the brush,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.860

usually hung there.

He died unjustly.

That must have left him
with unresolved grievances.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.030
So he had to take his disciple

that no wounds are found
on either hand of the deceased.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.170
That should be recorded separately.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.850
My mistake.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:48.830

that the wound is on the left chest,

The sword is dull.

the assailant

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.580

How can you be sure there was a killer?

Why couldn't he have been possessed

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.360
and committed suicide?

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.220
If it were suicide,

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.440
given the deceased's arm length,

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.880
he couldn't possibly have
reached the hilt.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.830
If he had gripped the blade

to stab and penetrate his chest,

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:27.480
then his palms

would certainly show wounds.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.750
Moreover, given how dull this sword is,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.480
suicide is simply impossible.

Though highly poisonous,

when used in proper doses,

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.540
it's simply a medicinal herb.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.160
It can reduce swelling, relieve pain,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.440
improve circulation, and purify blood.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.630
More importantly,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.030
it alleviates suffering from sores.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.320
So,

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.280
Father, you've been using it
to treat your sores.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.440
Just to

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.170
ease the pain a little.

[Fair and Impartial]

Sheriff Su,

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:13.950
Geng Wushang is here.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.720
Sheriff Su, you've given my daughter
the opportunity

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.270
to perform autopsies twice in succession,

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.870
making her a proper coroner.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.720
I, Geng Wushang, have come specially
to thank you.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.270
Mr. Geng,

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.510
you personally trained

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.070
such an excellent coroner.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.410
It should be I who thanks you

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.790
on behalf of the county office.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.810
You're too kind. You're too kind.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:42.310
[Integrity and Harmony]

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.640
Mr. Geng, please enjoy.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:45.900
Sheriff Su.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.070
So,

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.590
Mr. Geng, you want to see

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.640
those two life-borrowing pouches?

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.240
Of course,

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.550
I have no such authority.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.250
But as a coroner

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.400
who has worked alongside constables
for decades,

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.560
I naturally care about the case

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.950
and am somewhat curious.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.140
So...

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.180
This is exactly what I want.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.550
I was hoping you would take a look.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.940
Yingtao, bring them here.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.650
Father.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.980
[Integrity and Harmony]

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.000
Seven times seven, 49.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.110
It's a number of extreme yin energy.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.110
Perfect for suppressing
the souls of the dead.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.400
Killing to borrow life

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.200
is not unprecedented.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.960
Twenty years ago in Chang'an,

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.800
there was a similar case.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.470
A merchant, instigated by a sorcerer,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.830
killed four people in a row

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.440
to extend his father's life.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.480
He put the characters "one,"
"three," "six,"

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.000
and "nine"
in those life-borrowing pouches.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.510
I remember Yao

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.640
was less than 10 years old then

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.790
and had just become my disciple.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.850
When he helped me with the autopsies,

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.350
he was so frightened
that he couldn't stop crying.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.640
The county sheriff at that time,
Du Shenyan,

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.270
based on the autopsy findings
from the county office,

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.130
quickly found the murder weapon,

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.600
identified the suspect,

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.090
and caught the killer.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.760
In the end, both the killer
and the sorcerer

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.080
were sentenced to waist-cutting execution
by the court.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.450
This life-borrowing sorcery

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.640
is nothing but a trick

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.970
for the wealthy and powerful to buy lives.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.270
Now that we've found characters
"one" and "three,"

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:29.830
characters "six" and "nine"
will surely appear.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.830
Doesn't that mean

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.730
two more people will be killed?

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.350
There are numbers in the pouches too?

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.830
Yes, right here with me.

[Geng Residence]

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.440
I'm old now.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.640
I've been a coroner all my life.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.790
Yet in the end,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200
I'm about to break

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.070
the rules of our profession.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.880
Master, what do you mean?

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.440
The coroner's art is passed down orally

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.350
and never written in books.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.350
Do you know why?

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.920
I've heard you explain this before.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.550
Because since ancient times,

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.240
damaging corpses has been a grave taboo.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.270
Once written down,

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.310
people might follow the book

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.710
and practice on corpses.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.000
This could lead to corpse desecration.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.660
Therefore,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.070
coroners never document their methods—

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.680
this has been a tradition
for thousands of years.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.080
For the past three years,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.260
I've poured my life's experience

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.830
into my book, "The Autopsy Chronicles."

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.680
Tell me,

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.860
is this right or wrong?

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.270
I believe it's right.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.380
If we don't document

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.240
autopsy techniques in writing,

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.300
some skills will be lost forever.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.400
How would that help
future generations seek truth

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.530
and uphold justice?

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.400
It seems you both support me.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.200
However,

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.300
I've run into a problem.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.790
In my vision,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.470
"The Autopsy Chronicles" will
consist of 20 volumes,

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.200
with 100,000 words.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.130
I've now written the last chapter

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.330
of the final volume.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.270
But I can't decide what I should write

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.890
to wrap up this book.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.960
Yao,

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.150
give me some advice.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.580
Me?

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.350
How could I offer advice to you, Mentor?

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.720
You're being too modest.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.690
You came to me

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.410
when you were just a child.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.100
Though you couldn't read,

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.040
you were extremely intelligent

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.640
and had great potential.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.790
As for the ancient
Red Umbrella Autopsy Method

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.680
and the Plum Cake Autopsy Method

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.580
recorded in the books,

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.720
I completed them

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.790
with your assistance.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.510
The Open-Pit Bone Steaming Method

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.120
even originated from your suggestion.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.550
Not at all.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.440
That method was created by you, Mentor.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.700
My random suggestions

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.140
didn't count for much.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.130
My only true original creation

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.490
is the Nine Poisons Verification Method.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.310
Nine Poisons Verification?

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.160
That is the method
I developed after you left,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.110
drawing on the teachings of the ancients

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.070
and my own experience

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.580
in examining corpses.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.300
Yao, you want to learn it?

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.070
I've already left the coroner profession,

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.000
so I no longer have the right to read

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.440
"The Autopsy Chronicles"
that you're writing.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440
Not necessarily.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.750
What if I invite you

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.660
to be a co-author of this book?

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.960
Master, what did you say?

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.680
I invited you to dinner today

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.320
because I wanted to tell you

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.270
that I want to list
"The Autopsy Chronicles"

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.670
as co-authored by us, master and disciple.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.310
How could that be appropriate?

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.400
That is your life's work.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.920
How could I claim part of the credit?

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.830
Senior Yin, please don't refuse.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.480
Father has had this intention
for a long time.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.160
Back then, when the Ministry of Justice
and the Court of Judicial Review

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.400
asked Father for coroner recommendations,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.130
he recommended Senior Shizai.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.480
It wasn't because he
thought little of you,

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.550
but because he treasured your talent.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.400
He wanted you

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.030
to stay by his side for a few more years

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.830
and help him complete this book.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:38.310
I see.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.550
I've wronged you, Mentor.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.600
Father.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:49.070
I was going to persuade you
to go back to being a coroner,

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.440
but recently I've heard
you're doing very well

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.460
as a mortician.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.270
When I walk down the street,

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.960
people come to thank me—

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.790
because you, my beloved disciple,

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:00.240
beautified the appearance
of their deceased relatives.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.840
I've gradually come to
understand something:

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.330
giving the deceased
a beautiful appearance and dignity

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.300
and revealing the truth
behind their sudden death

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.880
are equally important.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.770
Therefore, I've decided

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.560
to respect your choice.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.030
Whether you go back
to being a coroner or not

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.190
doesn't matter,

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.280
and it has nothing to do

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.420
with being my co-author

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.580
on the book.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.100
Mentor, I...

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.030
Get up first.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.710
You don't need to rush to decide anything.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.570
After all, the Coroners' Contest

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.679
will not close registration
for another three days.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.960
But there's something
that needs to be handled right now.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.280
I have already written

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.290
the notice expelling Zhong Shizai
from my tutelage.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.760
The reason I'm doing this

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.690
is to prevent

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.880
the soon-to-be-published

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.139
coroners' manual from being disgraced.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.840
Do you understand?

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.469
I understand.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.110
Zhong Shizai is impatient
in his pursuit of success

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:58.970
and two-faced.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.240
You should have expelled him long ago.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.070
But according to the rules
of our profession,

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:05.880
this notice

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.320
must be signed by both of you,
my disciples.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.880
Yao, you couldn't read or write
as a child,

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.380
but I've heard

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.110
that you've learned now.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.190
Yes.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.760
In the three years
since leaving the coroner profession,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.550
besides working as a mortician,

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.640
I've been studying

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.330
and practicing calligraphy.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.760
You're so diligent, Yao.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.710
I just hope that one day,

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.440
when I inherit your legacy, Mentor,

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.450
people won't say I'm illiterate.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.110
Good.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.840
Come with me then.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.220
[Notice of Expulsion for Zhong Shizai]

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.190
[Witness: Suchan]

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.800
Look.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:46.590
[Mentor: Geng Wushang]

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.960
I have already signed,

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.950
and Suchan has signed too.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.010
Now we just need you.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.430
[Witnesses: Suchan; Yin Yao]

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.160
Write down the date.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.400
June 23rd.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:35.710
Mentor,

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:37.840
are you alright?

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.710
I'm fine.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:47.370
I know.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.490
Senior Shizai has followed you
for many years, after all.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.150
But Master, you needn't be sad.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.440
It's not that you're heartless.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.630
It's Zhong Shizai himself—

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.290
he brought this upon himself.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.630
I've already decided

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.690
what to write for this final chapter.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.290
I'll write about

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.530
why a coroner must not kill.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.190
Master,

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.030
forgive my frankness,

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.610
but isn't that rather obvious?

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.540
No one may kill.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.060
Please reconsider.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.810
There must be a better topic

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.840
to conclude "The Autopsy Chronicles."

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.440
But my health...

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.340
Don't worry.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.800
You still have many years ahead of you.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.960
How would you know?

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.160
Although I've moved out,

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:31.760
don't I visit you

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.840
every three days?

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.770
Actually, every three days,

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.510
I also go to the temple

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:38.840
to pray for your longevity.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.880
I was granted
a divine revelation long ago,

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.480
foretelling that you still have
many years to live.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.140
Senior Yin, you're so filial.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.880
I, Suchan, don't measure up.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.010
Su Wuming!

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.480
There's been another murder!

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.310
A beggar

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.710
also picked up a life-borrowing pouch!

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.180
Summon Coroner Suchan.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:24.500
Coroner Suchan has come to
examine the body!

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.420
All unrelated personnel,

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.110
step back!

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.040
[Six]

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.400
Father, I'm back.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:35.950
Father!

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.550
Father!

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.670
Su Wuming!

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.580
Didn't you say you wanted to eat sushan?

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.360
I brought some for you!

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.900
Quick, come with me
to Coroner Geng's house.
