=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.130
=Episode 31=

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.119
You have a new food delivery order.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.039
Mr. Shen.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.839
Your skills haven't aged at all.

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:30.240
Well?

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:31.960
I made it for your nephew.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.960
I'll test it for him.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.240
Don't break it.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.600
It's fun.

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:41.559
Eat. Why aren't you eating?

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.399
I saved

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.759
some of the food for Bichen.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.839
No need to save any more for her.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.319
Mom, no need to save any for her.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.319
She's eating at her parents' today.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.440
She went to her mom's?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.440
Will she be back tonight?

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.800
Yeah, I'll pick her up later.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.640
Dad, Mom.

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:05.160
I want to discuss something.

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.679
Go on.

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:08.760
Chen's cultural center

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.520
built a new center at Qianhu.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.559
They're short on staff.

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.279
If she transfers, she gets promoted.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.839
They also give staff housing.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.599
Chen and I checked it out.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.960
An 80 square meter, two-bed unit.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.279
The environment is great.

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:21.599
There's a lake and courts.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.240
Wait, Qianhu...

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.879
Where on earth is that?

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:25.999
Very far.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.559
A place no one goes to.

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:28.879
Dad, you're exaggerating.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.119
There's a new highway.

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.599
It's only 40 minutes.

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:32.520
4...

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.040
Is 40 minutes not far?

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.879
Exactly, it's too far.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.640
You...

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:37.640
Alright. Let me ask.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640
Why are you telling us this?

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.159
What do you mean?

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.399
Chen said she wants to go.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.480
She wants to go. Chen...

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.080
She's pregnant.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.879
It's not a problem.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.559
She's months from due date.

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.719
Her boss said

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.559
she'll get full maternity leave.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240
Mainly, these years

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.520
she's been filling forms.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.320
She finds it meaningless.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.240
This center is built from zero.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.119
To her,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.719
it's a great chance to shine.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.439
She'll go shine.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.399
What about you?

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:12.240
Exactly.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.240
I'll quit my job

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:16.439
and go with her.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.760
Quit?

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:20.999
How will you provide?

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.119
Mom, let me finish.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.960
You're a grown man.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.279
You should provide.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.320
If you quit this job,

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.080
you'll have nothing.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.399
You can't support a family.

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:32.879
But I'll have time.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.399
Chen and I agreed.

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:35.800
After the baby comes,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.760
I'll raise them.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.640
You'll quit and raise the baby?

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.240
You're a grown man.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.800
Mom, what's that thinking?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.760
There are tons of super dads.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.640
And online it says

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.360
when elders raise kids,

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.760
they tend to spoil them.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.350
What do you mean?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.119
Looking down on us?

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.679
Yeah.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.839
Did we spoil

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.040
you and your sister?

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.640
Yes.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.559
I said it wrong.

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:02.439
I didn't mean that at all.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:03.760
Silly kid.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.839
You're silly.

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.360
No, I...

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.320
Let me ask you.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.559
Bichen went home today.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.999
Did she tell her parents

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.559
about this too?

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.399
Yes.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.279
You two decided long ago.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.320
You're just letting us know.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.279
Informing us.

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.359
Then you'll disappear.

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:24.760
This isn't informing.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.200
We're really discussing.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.320
Discuss my foot.

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.640
You call this discussing?

00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:30.960
If you're leaving, go now.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.760
Dacheng, calm down.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.479
Call Zhixia

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.399
to deal with him.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:37.960
Don't call her.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.159
She's pregnant,
working, and raising Jiao.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.760
She's handled
every family issue for years.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.680
I don't want to add pressure to her.

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.239
Besides,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.479
I'm becoming a dad.
I can't live at home forever.

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.159
Clothes handed over and meals ready.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.000
Chen and I

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.919
have already decided.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.960
Zhixia.

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.039
Now I finally know how tired you are.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.359
The whole family's affairs

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:07.000
are all on you alone.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.839
And no one steps up for you.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.599
Come home, okay?

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.159
Tell me where, I'll pick you up.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.000
Okay?

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:33.279
Maodou, are you free?

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.200
I need you.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.880
Dad, you're back.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.479
Mom.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.359
Where's Zhixia?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.799
Working late.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.760
Let me tell you.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.839
I'm going to talk to her.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.960
Her attitude toward me was bad today.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.039
She hung up on me.

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:06.520
Is that how you treat elders?

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:11.950
Jiao. Do your homework in your room.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.279
Mom, I...

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.080
I want to ask you something.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.200
Why did you call Zhixia

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.039
and tell her to check the baby's gender?

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.399
I told you already.

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:33.760
The old house is being demolished.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.599
I need to plan our assets.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.680
She worked at a newspaper agency before,
right?

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:40.159
No sense of the bigger picture?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.440
I'm happy whether it's a boy or girl.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.640
But the issue is when they grow up.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.880
A boy needs a wife.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.399
I know.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:50.479
A girl needs to get married.

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.640
- It's not the same.
- I know.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.520
Why ignore even the basic traditions?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.760
I know.

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.560
I know.

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.239
Can you stop making more trouble?

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:00.520
Please rest.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.200
You want me to rest?

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:04.599
I want to rest.

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:06.760
I was doing fine at the senior college.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.960
Who was it?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.000
Who called me

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to get Jiao?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.919
I had to drop everything

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:12.880
and pick her up.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.640
Zhixia is her mother.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.039
Her job is flexible.

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:17.839
She has time.

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.880
She's a mother too.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.479
Right?

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:21.960
She needs to balance

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.520
family and work.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.640
Mom.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.640
You've been through it too.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.200
When I was little,
you asked Grandma to watch me a lot.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.599
You argued with Dad
and scolded him for never helping.

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:37.839
You were fine being a mom back then.

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.000
Now that you're a grandma,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.719
you're suddenly strict and picky.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.839
You want Zhixia
to balance career and family.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:43.719
Why?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.919
I'm just a clerk.

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:48.000
When my boss sends me on a trip,
I have to go.

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:49.560
Who supports this home?

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.710
Why don't you hold me
to the same standard?

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:53.200
You're a man.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.520
So what if I'm a man?

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.520
In this family,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.640
Zhixia earns more than me.

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:02.239
I'm not capable.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:03.919
She pays most

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:05.560
of our mortgage.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.200
Look at yourself.

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:13.560
You're useless, completely beyond help.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:15.359
I'm useless.

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:16.719
I'm helping you.

00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:17.680
What do you mean?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.760
You're blaming me?

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.719
I'm wrong?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.000
I'm useless.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.160
I'm useless.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.599
Mom.

00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:59.320
When are you coming home?

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.479
Dad and Grandma argued.

00:09:02.119 --> 00:09:03.280
I'm a little scared.

00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:10.800
Zhixia.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.400
Go back if you want.

00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:15.040
No.

00:09:16.359 --> 00:09:17.680
I've imagined

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.400
living care freely many times.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.200
But once I think of Jiao,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.920
I just can't do it.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.040
I managed to do it today.

00:09:26.239 --> 00:09:27.560
I'm not going back.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.160
Sure.

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:34.479
Jiao.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.599
I'm out of town for work.

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:39.639
Listen to Dad at home.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.479
Do your homework.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.800
I said I'm not going back.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.999
You keep turning your phone on and off.

00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:55.200
Aren't you tired?

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.920
I'm worried about Jiao.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.800
I argued with Zhang Hao,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.599
but Jiao's my own child.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.160
Maodou.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.400
Look at this room.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.920
Isn't it nice?

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.680
Isn't it fancy?

00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:12.680
Let me tell you.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.680
This bed is comfortable.

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:15.599
Really.

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:17.359
It's super soft.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.359
It's a waste for me to stay alone.

00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:24.200
That's why I asked you over for a bath.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.400
Still a waste.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.479
You should've invite
your whole family to bathe.

00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:29.920
Jiao loves taking baths.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.999
Our tiny bathroom at home

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:33.920
can't even fit a wooden tub.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.599
Zhixia.

00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:36.999
Every three sentences, you mention Jiao.

00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:38.479
Are you here to relax

00:10:38.479 --> 00:10:39.879
or to torture yourself?

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.879
Maodou.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.599
Do women have to

00:10:48.479 --> 00:10:50.680
stay trapped in marriage for their kids?

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.400
No idea.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.080
But my mom always said

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.280
she'd have left my dad

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.320
if it weren't for me.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.359
And now?

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:01.839
Now they're so close
that it's ridiculous.

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:03.479
They nag me to date every day.

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:07.599
Thinking of that,
I don't want to go home.

00:11:08.719 --> 00:11:10.440
Zhixia, I'm staying with you tonight.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.850
We two will make the room worth it.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.280
Call it team bonding.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.999
I've never seen a boss as stingy as you.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.719
The world's big.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920
Nothing's impossible.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.440
No.

00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:26.759
Take this away.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:28.879
I have to compensate if it gets oily.

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:29.719
Fine.

00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:31.040
I'll eat over here.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.440
This kid.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.920
You're paying
for that champagne tomorrow.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.920
I didn't drink it.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.680
I only ate what you ordered and left.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.519
You're so stingy.

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:50.040
Like boss, like subordinate.

00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:04.960
Madam Wang.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.479
Thanks for taking care
of my mom these days.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.920
Please take this.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.759
Thank you.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.800
Feng.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.719
Come here.

00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:20.200
Look, I will keep half.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.560
Your mom still needs money later on.

00:12:23.239 --> 00:12:24.320
You two girls

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.280
really have it tough.

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:27.440
Alright.

00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:29.080
Thanks, Madam Wang.

00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:29.839
You're welcome.

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:04.280
Our son's so disciplined.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.400
He hasn't streamed for days.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.519
He's pretty driven

00:13:08.599 --> 00:13:09.920
when he has his heart set.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:11.879
He's just

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.479
not putting his heart into it,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.759
but he knows what matters.

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:16.440
Yeah.

00:13:17.999 --> 00:13:20.680
Order a menu for tomorrow.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680
Who ordered this?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:23.879
From Wang.

00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:25.839
Dad, Mom, I'm back.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.839
Why are you home so late?

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.839
No, who's this?

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.879
Where did this kid come from?

00:13:36.719 --> 00:13:37.280
No.

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:38.599
What's going on?

00:13:40.359 --> 00:13:41.280
To be exact,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.239
he's my brother-in-law.

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:45.759
What the hell?

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:53.839
He really does look alike.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.200
Mom.

00:13:57.479 --> 00:13:58.599
I want Mom!

00:13:58.599 --> 00:13:59.359
What's wrong?

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:01.719
Let me take you for a walk.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.999
Mom.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.080
He wet the bed.

00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:06.879
- I want Mom.
- Okay.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:07.759
Alright.

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:08.560
Mom.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.280
What is it?

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:11.359
I just want Mom.

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:13.400
I want to find Mom.

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:15.879
I want Mom.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.119
No crying.

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:20.680
Aren't you a man?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.400
Play on the swing.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.719
Look.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.560
Fireworks, look.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.040
Is it fun?

00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:28.800
Yeah.

00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:29.719
No more crying?

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.359
Will you cry tomorrow?

00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:32.119
No.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.400
You cried just now.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.639
You're not a man.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.560
Brat.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.719
You wet the bed last night.

00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:45.879
You know that?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.200
No.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:50.960
Here.

00:14:51.359 --> 00:14:52.639
No rush.

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:53.359
Mom.

00:14:55.359 --> 00:14:56.759
Did you sleep well?

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.599
It was okay. I'm fine.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.920
Come on.

00:15:00.479 --> 00:15:01.800
Stand up.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:02.879
Xiaoqi.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.519
Do you miss you mom?

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.160
Let's call her and ask

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.839
when she'll pick you up, okay?

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:08.719
- Sit down.
- Okay.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.759
Sit.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.400
Get dressed.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:14.320
Mom.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.879
Are you done?

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.680
Not yet.

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:18.920
I need a few more days.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.160
Xiaoqi, be good.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.359
No, Ding Hong.
Xiaoqi can't sleep in a new bed.

00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:23.970
He made a fuss all night.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.800
Kids are like that.
The first night is tough.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.920
He should be fine tonight.

00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:27.999
No.

00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:30.479
We're not obliged to watch your kid.

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:33.160
You're having a kid soon too.

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:34.719
If no one helps you,

00:15:34.719 --> 00:15:35.639
would you have one?

00:15:36.999 --> 00:15:38.359
I've already had mine.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.839
When I can't watch him

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:40.759
and must go out,

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:41.839
what am I supposed to do?

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:43.040
Throw him on the street?

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.680
How are you still this entitled?

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.879
When are you coming to get Xiaoqi?

00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:49.280
No idea. We'll see.

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:53.359
Why is that woman so unreasonable?

00:15:53.359 --> 00:15:55.599
My mom is not unreasonable.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.040
I'll throw you on the street.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:26.719
Hello?

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:29.479
Extend?

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.440
It's already noon.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.599
Sorry.

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:38.239
Let me ask

00:16:38.239 --> 00:16:40.320
if there's a discount for extending.

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:44.759
I won't extend then.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.800
I'll check out now.

00:16:47.599 --> 00:16:48.560
Right away.

00:16:50.239 --> 00:16:51.560
Get up.

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:52.839
We need to check out.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.320
Let's stay one more night, Zhixia.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.160
You lived care freely yesterday.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.479
I did, but I'm broke.

00:16:58.479 --> 00:16:59.080
Hurry.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.800
Or we'll get charged for half a day.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.879
Get up.

00:17:05.479 --> 00:17:07.479
How can you sleep this much?

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.880
You slept until this hour.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.840
Aren't we young people

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.640
supposed to eat and sleep well?

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.600
You slept this late too.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.239
I haven't slept well the last few days

00:17:16.239 --> 00:17:17.400
sharing a bed with Jiao.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.600
The bed here is really comfy.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:21.920
Zhixia.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.200
Where are you going after checkout?

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.960
Home?

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200
I'm not going back.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.200
I finally got out.

00:17:29.479 --> 00:17:31.360
I managed to live care freely for once.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.799
Zhixia.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.319
Isn't the difference a bit stark?

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.319
Life's tough,

00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:50.799
but the saved money is still ours.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.840
Look.

00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:53.880
I can sit here

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.600
and prop my feet up.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.160
Isn't this a bed now?

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.160
You okay?

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:01.440
Why is the stool pinching my butt?

00:18:02.239 --> 00:18:03.759
Bad quality, I guess.

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:05.479
Second-hand stuff is like that.

00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:07.440
It's fine. I can do this.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.360
Do it the other way.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.039
Take it slow.

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:09.880
Sit here.

00:18:10.239 --> 00:18:11.400
Legs up here.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.680
This works too.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.400
Cover with a blanket and sleep.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.880
Zhixia, I advise you to go back.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.880
Home may be bad, but not this bad.

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:24.799
I said I won't go back.

00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:26.880
Middle-aged women adapt.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.360
They can be good to themselves

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.640
and can be tough on themselves.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:39.960
Hello, Mom?

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.160
Zhixia.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.559
Your dad called.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:44.920
Why didn't you pick up?

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.479
Listen.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.479
Your brother's quitting

00:18:48.719 --> 00:18:50.680
and going with Bichen to Qianhu.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.799
Mom, do you know
I'm divorcing Zhang Hao?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.440
Okay.

00:19:01.719 --> 00:19:02.640
Which one do you want?

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.200
I want

00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:06.120
this one.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.230
This one? You didn't get it.

00:19:08.239 --> 00:19:08.840
Ni.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.719
I'm not too sure

00:19:09.719 --> 00:19:10.600
if these are okay.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.079
Sure, no problem.

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:13.880
Feng Xiaoqi, come see.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.319
As long as you behave,

00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:16.960
all this is yours.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.160
Why would I cry?

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.079
I'm a man.

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:23.279
Men don't cry.

00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:25.200
I'm filming you.

00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:27.160
Okay, go ahead.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.120
I, Feng Xiaoqi, promise

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.559
I definitely won't cry.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.120
Okay.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.880
Here, hold this.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.039
Pick what you want to eat.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.360
Choose what you want.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.279
Hu Gang.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.400
Your dad's upright, right?

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.519
Of course.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.440
Can you promise

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.319
you don't have illegitimate siblings?

00:19:45.999 --> 00:19:47.079
Of course not.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.239
Dad had a vasectomy long ago.

00:19:51.519 --> 00:19:53.519
He's a good man then.

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:55.559
I learn from my dad.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.600
I learn from my dad.

00:20:18.319 --> 00:20:18.960
Mingzhu.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.920
Feng Xiaoqi wants me
to record a promise.

00:20:21.719 --> 00:20:23.239
I, Feng Xiaoqi, promise

00:20:23.239 --> 00:20:24.519
I definitely won't cry.

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:26.160
Okay.

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:55.519
Xiaoqi, stop messing around.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.239
You'll fall later.

00:20:57.239 --> 00:20:58.120
Hear me?

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.799
It's fine. I won't fall.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:15.039
Mingzhu, I'm back.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.360
How's Mom today?

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:20.479
Better.

00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:21.200
Give it to me.

00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:26.719
Come down.

00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:28.719
Come down.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.360
I told you to come down.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.600
Can't you hear me?

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:34.960
Stand properly!

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:38.680
I can't do anything here.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.920
I want Mom.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.960
Hurry up.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.279
Is your mom fit to be a mom?

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:45.440
Don't talk about my mom like that.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.079
Don't...

00:21:46.079 --> 00:21:46.920
Stop it!

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:48.479
Move again, I'll throw you out.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.319
This brat.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.079
He has no manners at all.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.239
Dare you try again?

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.960
This house is not bad, Honey.

00:22:14.519 --> 00:22:15.719
Yeah, this price

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.160
is a real bargain.

00:22:18.239 --> 00:22:20.120
The house is nice,

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.160
but I'm buying it
as my son's wedding home.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.960
- I'm afraid...
- Let's check that side.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.640
Foreclosed homes are unlucky.

00:22:26.239 --> 00:22:26.920
Right.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.600
I heard in this house,

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.759
the son died then the father died.

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:31.360
Really?

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:33.640
Then it's not suitable
as a wedding home.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.470
- We need to think.
- Yeah.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.799
But the space is big.

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:39.039
Look here. Isn't this...

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.680
I...

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.640
The renovation...

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.440
I've always wanted a river-view home.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:44.920
Yes.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.479
Right?

00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:47.519
This place has a sofa set.

00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:49.400
The layout is really good.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.319
Environment's nice too.

00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:51.759
The lighting outside.

00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:52.360
Yes.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.279
Very open.

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:54.680
Just a few issues.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.680
Everything else is good.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.640
Indeed, yes.

00:22:57.039 --> 00:22:57.860
It's especially nice.

00:22:58.719 --> 00:22:59.239
This...

00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:01.600
We need a feng shui expert here.

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:02.600
Feng shui.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.239
Mom says I own half of this big house.

00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:07.400
All yours.

00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:08.680
Great.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.680
Dad says I have a good sister.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.160
He wasn't lying.

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:17.519
Sis.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.999
But my dad is dead.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.440
Go home.

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:34.920
Behave.

00:23:37.239 --> 00:23:37.840
Go back.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:12.999
Next.

00:24:12.999 --> 00:24:13.840
8051.

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:18.239
Sit there and wait for me.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.120
Be good.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.960
ID and household registration book.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.440
ID.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.460
Household registration book.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.060
(Resident Death Certificate Feng Zhi)

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.559
Dad, Mom.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.680
Hello, Grandpa, Grandma.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.640
Here comes the bed-wetter again.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.600
What are you here for?

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.840
To play.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:40.479
You're here to play?

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.920
Meiqi is taking my mother-in-law
for physiotherapy.

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:44.279
I need to go to the pharmacy.

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:46.680
There's no one to watch this kid.

00:24:47.479 --> 00:24:48.640
Are we not people?

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:50.880
Just leave him here. Go.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.719
Mom.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.759
He has his cup and toys here.

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:54.999
Behave here.

00:24:54.999 --> 00:24:56.160
Don't run around, got it?

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.680
Yes, Mingzhu.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.600
I'm leaving.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.400
Eat something first.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.880
No, I don't have time.

00:25:01.999 --> 00:25:03.160
You call her Mingzhu.

00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:04.559
You call me Grandpa.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.360
Grandpa.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.960
Can I play on the swing outside a bit?

00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:10.960
Of course.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.440
Is that okay?

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.680
Just don't go too close to the water.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.440
- Is that okay?
- Go.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:15.999
It's okay.

00:25:16.719 --> 00:25:17.999
Don't wander too far.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.600
Come when called.

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:23.319
No matter how tired,

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.600
we'll bring you home.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.440
No matter how tired,

00:25:27.719 --> 00:25:29.719
we'll bring you home.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.999
I have to bring you troublemaker home.

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:35.400
What are you here for?

00:25:38.239 --> 00:25:39.279
Deliver equipment?

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.600
Want me to keep roaming outside?

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.559
No.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.860
You don't want
to come home with me either,

00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:46.880
so I sent myself over.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.600
The milk's almost expired, right?

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.479
Impossible.

00:25:57.759 --> 00:25:59.600
Heaven closes a door for me.

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:03.079
It will surely open a window.

00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:04.759
Ms. Xu.

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:07.719
Listen to me.

00:26:07.719 --> 00:26:09.039
Jiao misses you.

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.880
She asks me every day
when you'll be back.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.400
How do I even tell her?

00:26:12.999 --> 00:26:13.920
Stop.

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:16.360
I want to set an example for Jiao.

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:19.279
I want her to know a woman can't
be held hostage by her child,

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:21.920
can't take every grievance silently,
can't always suffer first

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.840
and enjoy later.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.079
You're so right.

00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:25.279
I totally agree.

00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:27.479
And my mom

00:26:27.479 --> 00:26:29.239
isn't really sexist.

00:26:29.239 --> 00:26:30.999
Maybe a little.

00:26:30.999 --> 00:26:32.160
She's just stubborn.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.160
She wants to sort out the family assets.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.559
Your mom's stubbornness

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:36.999
hits my weak spot perfectly.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.200
I've always been hard to manage.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.220
Had I been born later, the one sent
away from our family would have been me.

00:26:42.239 --> 00:26:43.200
No way.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.279
Zhixia.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:45.840
Well...

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.759
See.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.719
You lost your temper again.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:50.999
Fine.

00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:52.680
You're not going back, right?

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.039
You're not going back.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.200
I may not be good at much,

00:26:56.479 --> 00:26:57.759
but I excel at keeping company.

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:00.039
I'm going nowhere today.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.160
I'll stay at the door.

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:02.479
We'll be a perfect pair.

00:27:02.479 --> 00:27:03.880
I'll stay with you. I'll sleep here.

00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:05.079
I even brought a bed.

00:27:05.759 --> 00:27:06.519
Alright?

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.680
I'm not leaving.

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:09.120
I...

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.880
I left it at the door for you.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.559
I tried it. It's quite comfortable.

00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:18.840
Cooking?

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.200
Yes.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.440
These radishes look fresh.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:21.999
Yes.

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:23.279
Okay.

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:24.920
- Okay.
- Help out more when you can.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.799
Don't worry.

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:27.200
Cook something nice later.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.479
No need. Do your thing.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.920
This chive is good too.

00:27:32.079 --> 00:27:34.200
My dad and Mr. Shen are brothers.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.440
I get to decide who gets
to play on this swing.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.279
Xiaoni, can I play?

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:41.079
Yes.

00:27:41.079 --> 00:27:41.999
Doudou, get down.

00:27:41.999 --> 00:27:42.920
Xiaoqi, go.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:45.880
Doudou.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.519
If you want to swing, push it first.

00:27:47.519 --> 00:27:49.440
No work, no play.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.999
Why should I listen to you?

00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:52.400
Because you have to.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.039
Dad said I'm the oldest here.

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:55.160
Everyone listens to me.

00:27:55.239 --> 00:27:57.600
My dad said your dad
profits off people's deaths.

00:27:57.719 --> 00:27:59.079
We can't listen to him.

00:27:59.079 --> 00:28:00.120
You're talking nonsense.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.200
Your dad's a big liar.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.279
How dare you bully Xiaoni?

00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:03.039
You're the liar.

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:03.880
What are you doing?

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.640
Gang fight.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.799
I'll count to three, let go.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.559
Stop fighting.

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:10.160
Three.

00:28:10.719 --> 00:28:11.719
Let go.

00:28:11.719 --> 00:28:13.120
Xiaoqi, let go.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120
Minghui.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.279
Doudou said my dad
profits off people's deaths.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.920
Who's Doudou?

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.799
You're Doudou?

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.079
Whose kid are you? How rude.

00:28:23.239 --> 00:28:24.999
He lives across the river.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.840
You live across the river?

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.880
You come to our house to play

00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:30.239
and cause trouble.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.640
Xiaoni wouldn't let me play first.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.759
I said no, you go away.

00:28:35.239 --> 00:28:37.239
Fine, wait and see.

00:28:37.239 --> 00:28:38.999
I'm going home to tell my parents.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.880
Go ahead.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.999
Fine, wait and see.

00:28:42.999 --> 00:28:44.039
We'll wait.

00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:46.799
Break it up.

00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:47.759
Feng Xiaoqi.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.120
Mingzhu wants me to bring you home.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.719
Let's go.

00:28:50.759 --> 00:28:51.719
Have fun.

00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:53.360
No more fighting, Xiaoni.

00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:54.600
Be careful.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.160
Okay.

00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:55.960
Bye.

00:28:56.999 --> 00:28:58.400
Push slowly.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.079
Get in.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.680
Here.

00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:13.160
Mingzhu.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.440
Your brother-in-law's back.

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:18.680
Mingzhu, I'm home.

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:20.039
You're back.

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:21.400
Were you good today?

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.519
Very good.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.500
He just finished a fight with Doudou.

00:29:24.519 --> 00:29:25.600
He fought?

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.279
No fighting, okay?

00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:28.719
You need to reason with Doudou.

00:29:28.719 --> 00:29:30.400
Reasoning won't work with him.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.239
You have to fight.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.920
Don't be a bad influence.

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:34.400
Don't listen to him.

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:37.039
Mingzhu, you're busy.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.960
Why not let Xiaoqi stay at our place?

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:40.360
He has food and fun here.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.440
Fights too.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.600
He's a boy.

00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:45.519
They can't grow up without fighting.

00:29:45.519 --> 00:29:46.719
Don't listen to him.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.400
Alright, you better head back.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:48.999
Okay.

00:29:49.719 --> 00:29:50.360
I'll go then.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.239
Be careful.

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:53.479
Bye.

00:29:53.479 --> 00:29:54.079
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:29:54.079 --> 00:29:54.920
Xiaoqi, bye.

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:02.079
Where did you get hit? Does it hurt?

00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:02.960
No.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.200
You can't get hurt, okay?

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.400
If you get hurt,

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.160
people will think we're abusing you.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.640
Abusing?

00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:12.479
Abusing means bullying a child.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.759
Mingzhu, you treat me so well.

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:17.120
It's fine if Mom doesn't pick me up.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.239
Xiaoni.

00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:26.759
Haven't gone home?

00:30:27.999 --> 00:30:28.840
Miaomiao said

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.440
Doudou went home to get backup.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.640
I'm waiting for him.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.559
He went home to get backup?

00:30:34.039 --> 00:30:34.640
It's fine.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:35.999
I'm here.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.360
However many come, I'll beat that many.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.519
Really?

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.920
Hit one and show me.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:44.759
Lu Bing.

00:30:46.079 --> 00:30:47.759
No, why are you here?

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.759
I can't be here?

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.799
Xiaoni.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.840
Come here.

00:30:54.759 --> 00:30:55.759
This is Lu Bing.

00:30:56.079 --> 00:30:57.120
Lu Bing.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.600
She hit me.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.120
He scolded me.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.440
Help me get revenge.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.200
Alright. Revenge.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.759
How do we do that?

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:07.999
Doudou.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.479
We're all family.

00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:11.360
It was just a misunderstanding, right?

00:31:12.719 --> 00:31:13.400
Xiaoni.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.039
Revenge never ends.

00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:17.400
Let's be generous.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.719
Didn't you say you'd help me?

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.160
Fighting won't solve anything.

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:25.279
Look at everyone now.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.840
We're family. Shake hands.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.719
Then we're good.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.479
We stay good friends, right?

00:31:29.479 --> 00:31:31.319
Who wants to be good friends with him?

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.999
Doudou.

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:44.400
Boys don't fuss with girls.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.039
Right?

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.319
I'll take you to swing.

00:31:47.319 --> 00:31:48.039
Alright?

00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:49.640
Okay then.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.160
Come on.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:55.200
Minghui's the best.

00:31:55.239 --> 00:31:55.880
Right?

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.400
Having fun, Doudou?

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.079
Yeah.

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:03.559
Come with Lu Bing more often then.

00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:04.880
Got it?

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.479
Mingzhu, I'm back.

00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:20.479
You're back.

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.400
Where's the lollipop from?

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.519
My sister bought it for me.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.840
One yuan each.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.600
She also bought me ice cream.

00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:32.120
Eight yuan each.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.360
So much sugar.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.710
Are you trying to lose your teeth?

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.799
I want all his teeth to rot.

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:38.519
No.

00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:41.039
You said I should brush my teeth well.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.880
Enough talking. Wash your hands.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:44.999
Come on.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:46.799
Wash your hands.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.160
Let's go.

00:32:57.479 --> 00:32:58.479
You all eat first.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.999
I'm staying at the hospital tonight.

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:02.840
Put Xiaoqi to bed a bit earlier.

00:33:03.239 --> 00:33:04.519
I'll relieve you after dinner.

00:33:04.519 --> 00:33:05.920
You're pregnant.
You can't stay overnight.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.519
It's fine.

00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:07.680
I took a nap this afternoon.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.999
You haven't slept for days.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.759
Be good.

00:33:10.719 --> 00:33:12.400
Be good. Hear me?

00:33:13.759 --> 00:33:14.759
Eat later.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.799
Bye, Mingzhu.

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:16.279
Bye.

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:17.200
Be careful, Mingzhu.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.640
Eat some vegetable.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.400
You only eat meat.

00:33:23.479 --> 00:33:24.640
Here. Eat this.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.519
Mom.

00:33:32.239 --> 00:33:33.519
Why are you sitting up?

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.160
I got tired of lying.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.680
Good timing.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.920
Let's eat first.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.519
We need to eat well

00:33:52.279 --> 00:33:53.799
and work with the doctors.

00:33:54.239 --> 00:33:55.799
Then you'll be able to go home soon.

00:33:58.759 --> 00:33:59.519
Go home.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.640
Which home?

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.119
Here. Eat while it's hot.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.720
Don't worry.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.159
This bracelet must be real.

00:34:29.999 --> 00:34:31.960
Did I do something wrong?

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:33.840
No.

00:34:34.999 --> 00:34:36.519
You did nothing wrong.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:40.240
Dad must have
run into something outside.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.519
Lies.

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:51.960
More lies.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.880
They're all nothing.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.880
As long as one lives

00:35:14.999 --> 00:35:15.999
and is around,

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.880
everything else is nothing

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.519
and not important.

00:35:24.679 --> 00:35:26.720
(It'd be easier if Jianqi only cheated.)

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.360
(As long as he's here,)

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.119
(everything else is nothing.)

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.159
No wonder sleeping with you
felt like lifting rice.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.240
I'm exhausted.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.840
Lost your stance?

00:36:41.559 --> 00:36:44.039
He said he's scared at night
and insisted on sleeping with me.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.360
I think he's pretty pitiful too.

00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:50.519
No dad.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.999
Mom's unreliable.

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:54.479
Just like me.

00:36:56.559 --> 00:36:57.519
How's Mom?

00:36:58.559 --> 00:36:59.559
Getting better.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.519
Class.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.199
Your third mock exam results are out.

00:37:08.999 --> 00:37:10.280
Our class average

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.880
is now top four in the grade.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.360
How is it?

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.159
That's major progress.

00:37:14.159 --> 00:37:14.920
Pretty good.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.720
But

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.639
some didn't do well this time.

00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:22.199
I hope they don't lose heart.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.479
Keep working hard.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.280
Ask me anytime if you don't understand.

00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:27.039
Alright?

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:29.599
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.639
Come on. Open today's textbook.

00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:35.340
(Physics: 58 points)

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.240
Hello.

00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:40.240
Hello.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.800
I'm a student from Nanzhou High School.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.240
My score for the third mock exam

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.999
in the science stream
is around 326 points.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.199
May I ask what schools I can apply for?

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.960
Last year, the science-track cutoff
for bachelor programs

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.360
is 448 points.

00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:55.720
Your total

00:37:56.159 --> 00:37:56.880
of 326...

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.840
Let's not talk academics.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.599
One goal, good jobs.

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:02.519
We won't talk jobs.

00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:04.679
Getting a job isn't a big deal for me.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.519
I just want to know if I get into

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.679
any bachelor's degree program
with this score.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.440
Impossible.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.160
You can try a vocational college.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.519
Bye.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.479
Feng Xiaoqi.

00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:22.840
Want some?

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:23.960
No.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.119
I just ate.

00:38:26.519 --> 00:38:27.679
It's a waste of money.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.679
So young and already so frugal.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.519
I want one. I'll buy it.

00:38:34.639 --> 00:38:35.159
Miss.

00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:36.760
This one tastes better.

00:38:37.519 --> 00:38:38.720
Alright. This one.

00:38:39.639 --> 00:38:40.479
Feng Xiaoqi.

00:38:41.679 --> 00:38:42.880
Mom!

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.519
Son.

00:38:46.999 --> 00:38:47.679
Son.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.360
Did you miss me?

00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:51.519
Yeah. I miss you every day.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.720
Candy again?

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.320
Did you brush your teeth tonight?

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:55.840
Yes.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.760
You brushed?

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.639
Give me a hug.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.360
Come here.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.519
You're heavier now.

00:39:06.159 --> 00:39:07.999
When I had Xiaoqi,

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.440
Feng bought me a shop

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.999
in my hometown.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.159
I went back and sold it.

00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:14.400
After paying the loan,

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.400
I have 448,200 yuan.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.199
Why are you telling us?

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.999
Because half of it belongs to your mom.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.800
I saved it in an account.

00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:28.639
Use it for Mrs. Feng's treatment.

00:39:32.639 --> 00:39:35.079
But we're taking our share

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:37.360
of Feng's insurance payout.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.720
They're separate matters.

00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:42.360
The insurance isn't much.

00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:44.050
After splitting it up,

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.250
each family could get
a maximum of over 50,000 yuan.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.159
I know.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.159
The amount doesn't matter anymore.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.639
What matters is fairness.

00:40:02.519 --> 00:40:04.840
I didn't bring Xiaoqi home

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.519
partly because of the flight price.

00:40:07.999 --> 00:40:09.119
But more importantly,

00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:10.039
that shop

00:40:10.119 --> 00:40:11.720
used to be rented to a tea house.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.639
Then the tea house
sublet to a mahjong parlor.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.320
The parlor owner

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.720
is a local thug.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.840
He's difficult to deal with.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.760
I knew selling the place

00:40:21.479 --> 00:40:23.280
wouldn't go smoothly.

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:25.440
Anyway,

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.760
I spent a lot of time

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.999
sorting it out.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.840
Thank you

00:40:32.199 --> 00:40:33.760
for taking care of Xiaoqi.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:35.920
Alright.

00:40:36.479 --> 00:40:38.519
Now that we handed over Xiaoqi to you,

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.840
we can relax.

00:40:40.639 --> 00:40:42.840
No more worrying every single day.

00:40:44.679 --> 00:40:45.800
Xiaoqi's well behaved.

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:47.720
He didn't trouble us.

00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:53.320
When I'm not busy,

00:40:54.479 --> 00:40:55.920
I chat with Xiaoqi

00:40:56.599 --> 00:40:58.240
and tell him how good you two are.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.479
If you ever treat him bad,

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.440
I'll come back and take him.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.440
The card password is Feng's birthday.

00:41:11.199 --> 00:41:12.519
Just transfer the money.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.479
Take the money.

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.119
Even if I deny it,

00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:27.639
you'd find out sooner or later.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.199
Just like I found out
about the insurance.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.639
So let's split everything clean and clear.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.800
The Feng family and I

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:38.760
go our separate ways.

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:40.360
We'll never see each other again.

00:41:58.159 --> 00:41:58.760
Alright.

00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:01.519
We'll get going then.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.280
- Xiaoqi.
- Ding Hong.

00:42:06.999 --> 00:42:07.880
Hold on.

00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:12.360
Xiaoqi, let's go. Come here.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.159
My father-in-law

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.119
left this gold lock to Xiaoqi.

00:42:24.519 --> 00:42:25.840
His birthday is engraved on it.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.400
Thank you.
