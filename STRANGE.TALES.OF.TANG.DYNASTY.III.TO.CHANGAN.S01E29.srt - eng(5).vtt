[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.960
[Episode 29]

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.930
[Tongji District]

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.680
Yingtao, go knock on the door.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.000
Yongzhou Prefecture investigation.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.400
Get the district head here at once.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.870
Yes.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.090
Where should we go next?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.400
After causing such a stir,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.360
don't tell me you don't know where to go.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.440
I really don't.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.000
You...

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.290
I am the district head.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.800
I heard you're
from the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.360
May I know

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.920
who you are, Officer?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.030
I'm the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.470
Lu Lingfeng.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.230
Let me ask you,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.630
who is the most famous

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.960
and wealthiest merchant in your district?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.890
There isn't one.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.470
The Tongji District

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.370
is east of Zhuque Avenue,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.530
on the east side of the second street,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.000
the thirteenth district
from north to south,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.530
and also the last district.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.850
Just south of here is the city wall,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.150
so it's pretty desolate here.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.750
Why would a wealthy merchant

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.540
want to live here?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.800
Really?

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.630
Wait, let me think.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.190
In the Tongji District,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.630
there are virtually no residences
of high officials

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.840
or famous people.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.030
The only somewhat famous old residence

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.560
belonged to one of
the Five Leaders of the Shenlong Coup,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.000
Huan Yanfan.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.920
That house

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.980
has changed hands several times.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.030
Recently,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.190
a man named Chen Chong has bought it.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.800
Right, he seems to be a merchant,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.000
a boot seller.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.880
He has a very large business.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.130
Where is his residence?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.570

Ancestor.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.390
Please forgive me.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.590
Ancestor.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.840
I, Chen Chong, am so incompetent.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.510
Ancestor,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.380
I have disgraced you.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.000
Ancestor,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.240
you were the most renowned scholar
of the Later Han,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.560
but in my generation,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.190
I didn't follow tradition
to become an official

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.950
and instead went into commerce.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.240
I now have a small reputation in Chang'an

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.430
and have been invited
to join the Jinguang Society.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.120
But its members are mixed,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.150
and some often engage in shady dealings.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.240
I have never involved myself
in any of them.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.300
I have not disgraced my forefathers.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.600
Ancestor,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.240
may your spirit in heaven

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.870
bless the Chen family
with great wealth and status

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.600
and many descendants.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.070

Who's there? Stop right there!

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.050
Y-You brazen thief,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.220
how dare you break in to steal?

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.780
Turn your head away.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.870
If you see me, you'll die.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.240
W-Who are you?

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.360
If you don't want to die, turn away!

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.570
You're not a thief.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.180
I was rude just now.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.720
Please forgive my disrespect.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.450
Please forgive my disrespect.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.400
My apologies.

[Chen Residence]

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.920
Ancestor, bless me. Ancestor…

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.110
Based on mere imagination,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.560
you pretended to be me
in the middle of the night

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.360
and went to the Tongji District.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.370
When did our mentor ever teach you

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.110
to solve cases like that?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160
Su Wuming didn't mean to impersonate you.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.830
It's just that
he has no official position.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.880
If he hadn't said he was you,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.410
how would the district head
have cooperated?

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.480
Making assumptions,
disturbing people at night,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.680
and even alarming the Imperial Guards!

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.950
You've not only disgraced
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.190
but also brought shame
to our mentor, Master Di!

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.360
-I...
-How could you say that about him?

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.560
Just before we arrived,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.890
Chen Chongzhen was nearly assassinated!

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.890
You are so certain of this,

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.920
but did you see it with your own eyes?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.480
No!

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.120
But I heard it directly from Chen Chong!

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.850
Is that credible?

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.360
What if Chen Chong had an ulterior motive

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.430
and fabricated this assassination attempt?

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.830
You…

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.180
Lu Lingfeng,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.690
how could you speak to Yingtao like that?

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.200
My apologies, Miss Chu.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.030
I need to have a serious talk
with Su Wuming.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.950
Xijun,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.620
please excuse yourselves, alright?

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.040
Su Wuming.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.430
You've gone too far!

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.270
What makes you say that?

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.600
Let's not talk about

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.750
whether the list
the High Priest, Shi Qiansui,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.430
provided is authentic or not.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.520
Even if it is authentic,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.980
why didn't you consider

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.480
[Imperial City]
[Yanfu District] [Yong'an District]

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.430
Yanfu or Yong'an Districts?

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.810
[West Market] [Yanping Gate]
[East Market] [Yanxing Gate]

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.840
[Kaihua District]
[Anren District] [Anyi District]

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.670
[Yanfu District] [Yong'an District]

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.430
This is the character that means "inch."

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.950
It symbolizes your shortsightedness!

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.720
Why didn't you consider

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.600
that Yanfu District and Yong'an District

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.260
would each have a murder case?

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.890
[West Market] [East Market]

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.280
[Yanshou District]
[Yong'an District] [Datong District]

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.460
[Kaihua District]
[Anren District] [Anyi District]

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.310
[Yanfu District] [Yong'an District]

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.710
This is the character that means "thirty."

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.000
If you just use your brain a little,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.870
you could create many more characters

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.260
on this map.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.680
But you didn't think about it at all.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.409
You decided that the murderer

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.000
intended to write the character

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.510
that means "gentry" in Chang'an.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.710
You're prejudiced against the gentry!

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.360
I indeed failed to catch the killer,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.670
but was my investigative approach

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.080
really so bad that it made you

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.360
fly into such a rage?

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.960
Compared to one's background,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.750
I believe a person's virtues,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.390
aspirations, and talents
are more important.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.910
Some people are born into the gentry,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.480
yet they do not see themselves

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.550
as nobler than the commoners;

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.360
they only see the suffering
of the common people.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.480
In that case, he is

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.010
nobler than the average gentry.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.910
Some people may be
born into common families,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.200
but they care about the nation
and the people.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.750
They are therefore worthy of respect.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.950
You're praising yourself, aren't you?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.550
My dear Official Lu,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.270
the river of time flows ceaselessly.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.270
Ever since the former Sui Dynasty

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.550
abolished the Nine-Rank Official System,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.360
the era of the gentry

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.790
has already passed.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.170
You need to accept this reality.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.320
You're a Metropolitan Graduate,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.630
so naturally you dislike
the Nine-Rank Official System.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.000
Of course, the Nine-Rank Official System

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.060
had its drawbacks.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.120
But if the court

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.850
had committed to reforming it,

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.720
it would still have been

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.960
an excellent system for selecting talent.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.240
That's why at the beginning of Tang,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.380
Emperor Gaozu restored this system.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.950
But after Emperor Taizong took the throne,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.720
didn't he abolish it again?

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.230
Therefore,
whether one is born into the gentry

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.920
is no longer that important.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.320
The gentry are not that important?

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.830
Let me ask you,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.440
the texts and classics that represent

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.670
the cultural lineage of China—

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.670
through whom were they passed down?

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.110
I admit that.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.440
Many ancient classics

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.910
were passed down to the present day

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.640
precisely through the gentry.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.000
Moreover, many gentry families

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.370
rose to prominence by annotating classics,

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.440
including your Lu family of Fanyang.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.970
It's good that you admit it.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.740
The gentry value refinement.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.880
What is refinement?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.840
It's not about holding high positions

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.240
or how much money one has,

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.550
but rather

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.030
excellent family education and traditions.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.840
In short,

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.020
refinement is the love for books.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.040
But Lu Lingfeng, have you considered

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.820
whether this, in itself,

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.460
is a kind of privilege?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.460
The vast majority of common people

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.630
simply do not have the chance
to become literate

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.960
and read books.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.360
If one day,

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.990
in the Tang Empire,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.150
those classics

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.670
were available for every commoner to read,

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.990
wouldn't it mean

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.080
that whoever loves reading is noble?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.570
You're twisting words.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.540
Lu Lingfeng,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.630
you were born into the gentry,

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.850
but since you traveled south with me,

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.210
I have clearly seen

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.490
that you care deeply
for the common people.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.440
I am an orphan who grew up

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.510
in the Chongnian Temple in Luoyang.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.190
I have always

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.970
cared about the common people.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.740
I am also a gentry member.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.030
I have the duty to defend

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.490
the dignity of the gentry.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.320
In today's Chang'an,

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.440
there is indeed friction
between the gentry and merchants.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.840
But when a merchant is dead,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.200
you, without any evidence,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.910
point the finger at the gentry.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.370
What are your intentions?

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.820
I have not locked onto a murderer.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.960
Is it not true that we have no new leads?

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.200
I simply connected those districts,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.550
and when I looked at them,

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.440
they looked like the character "gentry."

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:14.960
You…

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.880
Look me in the eye.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.200
Do you dare to say

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.960
that the killer you're imagining

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.220
isn't from the gentry?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.670
Lu Lingfeng.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.320
Su Wuming.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.360
Come with me.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.910
Yingtao, let go.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.080
Yes, I admit it.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.750
That's exactly what I think.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.350
So you admit to your slander.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.990
The gentry

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.000
should have the world in their hearts.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.120
How could they possibly

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.180
kill innocent people as you imagine?

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.290
You think
your Metropolitan Graduate status

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.870
is more honorable
than a hereditary appointment?

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.780
Let me tell you.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.910
Many of today's Metropolitan Graduates

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.630
possess only superficial literary talent.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.080
They have no real ability
to govern the state.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.080
They only know how to pass the exams,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.720
and their sole purpose of taking exams

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.850
is just to gain a salary from the court.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.320
But the gentry have family learning

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.870
and are familiar with court protocols.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.900
If the court were to reform

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.460
and rebuild the gentry,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.640
removing their old, corrupt flaws

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.420
and forging a new spirit
for the Tang gentry,

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.210
wouldn't that be a good thing?

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.000
I previously thought you only aspired

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.050
to protect the Tang Empire

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.030
and its people.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.440
But to my great surprise,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.550
you, Lu Lingfeng, also have

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.750
plans to become the Chancellor.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.930
This has nothing to do
with what position I hold.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.080
I, Lu Lingfeng,

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.190
am proud
to be from the Lu family of Fanyang.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.240
Also,

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.080
I care about the common people.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.990
The gentry aren't wrong.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.830
They're wronged by misunderstanding!

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.960
Lu Lingfeng is truly unbelievable.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.690
He showed you no respect at all.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.840
Perhaps this time, I truly was wrong.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.270
I mean my approach to the case.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.000
Both he and I

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.260
are committed to the ideals in our hearts.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.360
Therefore, a debate is quite normal.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.600
But today,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.720
I've realized that Lu Lingfeng

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.460
has great aspirations.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.720
He might truly become

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.910
the new hope for the gentry.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.510
I'm genuinely happy for him.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.960
He just lashed out at you,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.730
and you're still happy for him?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.750
Su Wuming,

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.480
are you a fool?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.910
I'm a fool?

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.670
Then you're an even bigger fool.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.420
You didn't catch up to him?

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.880
He ignored me
and just rode off on his horse.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.830
Men, you know.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.720
If he wants to be angry, let him be.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.390
Sometimes,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.440
you don't need to mind them too much.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.960
Oh no! I left Mr. Fei

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.120
at the Ghost Market yesterday.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.390
I wonder if he's come back.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.390
The Ghost Market?

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.100
That place is very dangerous.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.910
Mr. Fei.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.020
Master Fei.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.120
Master Fei!

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.480
You're back.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.860
Yingtao was so worried about you.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.580
I'm Boss Fei, after all.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.870
If I don’t come back,
who will run the shop?

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.440
Mr. Fei…

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.790
Yingtao, haven't you

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.550
had sushan in days?

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.490
I'll personally make one for you.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.160
A cherry-flavored one!

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.010
If I want one, I can make it myself.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.630
It's not the same.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:48.730
Master Fei,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.160
I have a favor to ask.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.120
Who are you trying to catch?

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.230
It's not catching someone.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.430
It's saving someone.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:03.380
[Wei Mansion]

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.960
I'm scared.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.080
It's alright, Jia.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.550
I don't want to see strangers.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.790
I don't want to see strangers,
Sister-in-law!

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.120
I don't want to see strangers.
I don't want to.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.830
I don't want to see strangers.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.600
Okay, no strangers.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:17.600
You won't see anyone.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.460
I don't want to.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.340
I don't want to.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.790
Please, have some tea.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.390
What kind of incense do you use here?

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.320
Just ordinary sandalwood.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.710
It's not ordinary;
the scent is quite unique.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.720
Xijun, I am truly sorry.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.870
My sister…

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.510
As you saw just now,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.720
she acts like that whenever she hears

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.910
she has to see a doctor.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.510
I'm afraid she may have a sudden episode

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.040
and hurt the old gentleman.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.420
That won't happen.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.620
Sir, you must not be careless.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.170
After all, during the examination,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.050
you'll be too close to her.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.400
Some illnesses

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.230
require close examination,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.270
but your sister does not.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.160
I got a grasp

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.790
of her situation just now.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.130
How about this?

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.069
I'll write a prescription.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.440
After you give her the medicine,

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.240
she will soon fall into a deep sleep.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:28.960
While she is asleep,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.270
I'll perform acupuncture on her.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.750
She'll get better within five days.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.350
As for a full recovery,

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.670
that will take 49 days.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.310
My sister has been ill for many days.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.590
We've consulted
all famous doctors in Chang'an,

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.190
but none had a good solution.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.120
You believe there is still
a chance for her to fully recover?

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.460
Of course.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.750
Otherwise, I would not

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.590
have said so.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.960
After all, a famous doctor
is not necessarily a miracle doctor.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.810
And a miracle doctor like me,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.400
though nameless...

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.750
Juniang,

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.770
Master Fei's medical skills are superb.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.030
He has saved countless people.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.110
I saw it with my own eyes

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.510
when we traveled south and west.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.370

Having you come here daily

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.450
would be too much trouble for you.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.110
That's true indeed.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.930
After all, I, Boss Fei,

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.400

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.750
Why don't we have the patient

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.770

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.510
No.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.880

I just didn't know

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.480

such a stubborn illness.

Miracle Doctor Fei,
if you don't find me too dull,

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.440
could you teach me
the acupuncture techniques?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440
How about I, on your behalf,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.440
perform the treatment on my sister?

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.510
T-That's…

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.030
If you're willing to teach me,

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.060
I'll offer three teals of gold

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.660
and become your disciple.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.570

You said you once learned acupuncture.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.590
If you only know the basics,

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.270
then teaching you

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.920
would be quite difficult.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.110

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.510

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.070
any famous doctors from the Du family.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.440
They don't practice medicine.

won't even require 49 days.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.200
In that case,

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.000
when my sister is fully recovered,

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.350

to thank you in person.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:05.200
Yes.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.960
Mr. Su, you're truly remarkable.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.830
Wherever you say there's a body,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:08.560
there is one.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.350
I'm impressed.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.570
This morning in Da'an District,

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.790
we didn't find any body.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.250
I must have been careless.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.100
I'll go back and search again.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.920
I'll go with Luo to search.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.320
Let's go.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:23.200
My master

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:23.920
[Anren District]

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.240
has indeed disappeared.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.440
It's been seven days already,

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.880
and still no news of him.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.840
Who else is in the household?

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.090
He has no children.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.330
His wife has passed away from illness.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.480
Does he have any

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.400
close friends?

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.630
My master has so many friends.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.640
Being a merchant,

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.000
if he didn't make many friends,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.730
how could his business expand?

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.100
Especially after joining
the Jinguang Society,

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.400
he often had evening banquets
with friends.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.270
Sometimes,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.880
they'd party until dawn.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.780
Jinguang Society?

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.510
I've heard that name

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.910
several times recently.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.400
What kind of organization is it exactly?

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.730
I'm not sure about that.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.440
It seems to be

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.200
an organization within the An Society.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.110
Ordinary merchants cannot join it.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.750
One must be like my master,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.070
extremely wealthy,

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.680
to qualify as a member.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.800
Captain Xue,

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.290
stay in Anren District

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.550
and do your best
to find the missing merchant.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.880
Focus the search on spots
near this residence

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.200
where a body might easily be hidden.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:20.720
Yes.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:26.410
[Zhaoguo District]

[Jinchang District]

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.080
[An Society]

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.480
The Zhao and Zhu families
in Jinchang District

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.480
have each received
one bag of grain and one jar of wine.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.770
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:58.830
Don't thank me.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.440
Thank the An Society.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.570
Right. We thank the An Society.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.080
Alright, take care.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.260
Excuse me, gentlemen.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.550
What's happening over there?

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.420
The An Society

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.230
gives handouts once a month.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.490
This month, they're giving out wine too.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.170
Yes, the An Society is benevolent.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.270
Right.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.240
What the heck?

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.840
It's deliberate provocation.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.160
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.240
Let's go.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.000
Thank you.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.400
-I'd like a share too.
-I'd like a share too.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.830
You're from Zhaoguo District, aren't you?

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.270
Yes.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.400
The Zhaoguo District

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.920
is home to high-ranking gentry families

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.780
and the Zheng family of Xingyang.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.240
The food and wine from the An Society

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.570
are only for commoners,

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.970
not for your kind.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:51.960
You...

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:53.790
What?

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.690
Sir, though I live in Zhaoguo District,

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.120
I'm only pretending to be a Zheng.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.070
My real surname is Niu.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.050
How can you prove it?

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.170
Look at me—

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.680
impoverished and miserable.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.440
My family can barely afford to eat.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.810
Please, have mercy on me.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.200
Then you must swear

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:17.880
that you're not a Cui, Lu, Li, Zheng,

I swear I'm not.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.420
Alright then, take it.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.610
Thank you.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.080
I don't want the wine.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.030
Could I

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.040
have another bag of grain instead?

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.000
Give it to him.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.150
Thank you.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:45.810
What's wrong with you?

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:46.680
I...

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.270
The Zheng family of Xingyang

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.440
has produced officials
and famous people for generations.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.970
For these two bags of grain,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.920
you begged this rabble

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.640
and even denied your ancestors?

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.300
Beat him up!

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.260
Stop!

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.240
This is a family affair.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.030
It has nothing to do with outsiders.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.830
You are openly hitting someone.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.790
This isn't inside your ancestral hall.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:11.920
I, an outsider,

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.400
insist on intervening!

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:16.950
It was them!

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.760
They deliberately provoked us.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.560
Please punish them, Sheriff Du.

How did they provoke you?

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.590
They're distributing grain and wine

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.130
but deliberately exclude

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.680
those born into the gentry.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.740
They're intentionally creating conflict.

[An Society]

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:30.920
It's the An Society.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.060
They're helping the poor.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.350
They are providing the supplies

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.240
and can give them to whoever they want.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.640
All of you are from high-ranking families.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.550
Whether you're doing well

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:40.790
or going through a difficult time,

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.200
letting such a trivial matter upset you

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.160
and fighting publicly in the street

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.190
is your fault!

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.000
I, the county sheriff,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.530
officially reprimand you.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.550
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.960
You may go.

Sheriff Du.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.440
I'm not afraid of being embarrassed,

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.160
but my family

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.560
truly has nothing to eat.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:07.070
Go.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.610
Thank you, Sheriff Du.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.940
Thank you, Sheriff Du.

Sheriff Du,
what's your view on this matter?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.920
Didn't I just

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.160
say my opinion?

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:26.790
But the An Society's behavior
is indeed inappropriate.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:27.910
It should not be ignored.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.590
[An Society]

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.190
Who's the man in charge here?

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.680
The officer
from Yongzhou Prefecture is here.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.010
Step forward and speak.

Greetings, Officer.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.550
It is certainly correct for you

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.350
to provide food and wine for the poor.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.480
But why discriminate
based on background?

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.270
I apologize,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.040
but I'm just following orders.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.440
Look, I have a list here.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.640
Districts where the gentry are
concentrated, such as Buzheng,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:53.920
[Buzheng, Chongren,
Taiping, Wuben, Xuanyang]

Guangde, Zhaoguo, Jinggong, and others,

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.200
are not included in the relief effort.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.400
What can I do about it?

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.760
Who made this rule?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.010
It was Chief He Bi.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.570
I happen to know

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.000
where Chief He is right now.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.590
Where?

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.070
At He Qian's residence,

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.640
arranging his brother's funeral.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.280
But

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.240
I can't accompany you there.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:21.270
Today, the magistrate

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.400
ordered me to punish those who litter.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.700
So I can only take my men

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.480
and patrol the streets,
checking for garbage.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:28.440
Look, look.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.620
To think I'm a constable.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:35.410
Sheriff Du,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.310
I was the one
who combined the murder cases

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.830
with the disappearances

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.590
and brought them
to the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.030
I have no objections,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.720
and I'm not complaining.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.720
I just hope you solve the cases soon.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.160
Also,

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:50.590
without the murder cases weighing on me,

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:51.920
I feel much more at ease.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.920
In three days,
I'm hosting a gathering at my home.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.050
Would you honor me with your presence?

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.310
Thank you for your kind invitation,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.580
but I'm truly too busy lately.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.590
What?

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.170
The Wei family of Jingzhao is
worthy of your company,

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.570
but the Du family isn't?

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.480
What do you mean by that?

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.120
The merit-record pillars.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.360
As the Wei family
unearthed their merit pillar,

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360
my Du family

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.960
also unearthed a record pillar.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.150
This family banquet I'm hosting

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.070
is to celebrate

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.510
my family's merit-record pillar
seeing the light of day again.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.639
If you could attend,

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.230
I

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.000
and my clansmen from the south of the city

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.659
will be very grateful.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.480
The An Society helping the poor
is an act of charity.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.760
[He Qian's Residence]

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.760
It's not easy
for merchants to earn money either.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.670
We have no reason

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.710
to give food
to those high-ranking gentry families.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.770
Besides, even if we wanted to give it,

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.650
would they even accept it?

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:50.810
It's your money,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.159
so of course you decide who to give it to.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:53.850
However,

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.030
intentionally escalating the conflict
between the gentry

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.550
and merchants is not right.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.410
If guilty, make amends.
If not, strive to do better.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.440
I heard that within the An Society,

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.920
there's an organization
called the Jinguang Society.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.480
Yes.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.550
I am the founder.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.460
Could you tell me about it?

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.000
Among the gentry, farmers,
artisans, and merchants,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.930
though merchants are ranked last,

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.280
they also make essential contributions

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.550
to Chang'an.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:23.960
Among merchants,

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.560
there should be role models.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.310
Therefore,
the Jinguang Society was founded.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.800
Only those who run the best businesses

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.110
and earn the most money can join.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.400
This also indirectly encourages

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.000
young people new to commerce

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.670
and those who are half-hearted

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.600
and not serious about their trade.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.190
May I ask, was Hua Fu

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.290
a member of the Jinguang Society too?

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:45.920
Yes.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800
What about Ma Kui?

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.130
Ma Kui was also a member.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.160
What about your brother He Qian?

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.590
M-My brother was also a member.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.270
By the way,

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.320
several other members

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.710
have mysteriously disappeared.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.110
Is the Jinguang Society…

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.120
Your ancestor

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.280
was from a famous family
in the Han and Wei Dynasties,

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.880
the progenitor
of the Chen family of Yingchuan,

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.960
respectfully referred to as Chen Taiqiu.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.020
Taiqiu's grandson

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.360
was Chen Qun,
an important official of the Wei Dynasty.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.230
He created the Nine-Rank Official System

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.250
and personally ushered in

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.510
the era of the gentry.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:43.710
Indeed.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.030
But I

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.960
have brought shame to my ancestors.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.190
Last night,

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.610
a thief really came to your residence?

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.320
It didn't seem like a thief.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.000
It should have been an assassin.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.320
But for some reason,

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.490
he didn't attack me.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.840
Thinking about it now,

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.160
perhaps my ancestor was protecting me.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.590
Could you tell me

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.250
exactly what happened?

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.750
[Chonghua District]

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.080
Write this down.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.170
No injuries on the body.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.260
Heavy blow to the back of the head.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:31.230
Non-standard weapon,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.710
likely a sharp, heavy object.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.040
It's the same killer.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.150
The cloth sack must have contained
the murder weapon.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.490
Based on your description,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.660
it sounds like an iron weight,

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.150
or…

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.480
a large stone.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.550
Yes.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.840
That sound was muffled and heavy.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.840
It could be a stone.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.030
You've built quite a business

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:01.200
selling boots.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.760
I hear you're the top seller
in Chang'an now.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.800
So you must have joined
the An Society, right?

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.520
Yes.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.150
And you've joined
the Jinguang Society too?

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.630
You know about that too?

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.550
Yes.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.280
The society leader
approved it a month ago,

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.140
so I joined the Jinguang Society.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.630
What does the Jinguang Society usually do?

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.030
Actually,

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.230
we just gather at the society hall

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.490
for evening banquets,

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.480
eating, drinking,
and exchanging information.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.230
But you see,

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.190
several people have died recently,

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.650
so we've stopped meeting.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.030
It also happens that the Jinguang Society

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.960
is expanding its villa
in the south of the city.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.510
Once it's completed,

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.730
we'll gather there for several days.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.650
Official Lu,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.440
the location of this villa

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.550
is truly blessed.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.550
As soon as construction began,

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.440
they unearthed the merit-record pillars

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.570
of the Wei and Du families of Jingzhao.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.320
Wait.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.960
Both families' merit-record pillars

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.410
were dug up there?

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:56.960
Yeah, I guess.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.370
That's just what I heard.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.200
I don't know anything else.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.240
I've said too much.

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:11.800
[Jinguang Society]

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.360
Come.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:13.150
Good.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.830
Lift it up.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.540
Put it here.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.230
Good.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.320
Careful.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.510
Put it here.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:25.660
Good.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.230
Come.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.630
Come.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.800
I was passing by the East Market

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.400
and brought you some snacks.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.510
Why?

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.260
Do I really have to say it out loud?

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.760
You don't have to, Official Lu.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.840
I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.960
I apologize to you.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.280
It's fine.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:16.200
You don't need to apologize to me.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.260
But Yingtao was quite upset with you.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.480
Su Wuming will soothe her.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:21.110
Besides,

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:22.880
she's a secret agent
of Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.960
We have different views

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.690
on investigation approaches.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.840
Arguments are inevitable.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:28.710
How about

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:30.960
you help me apologize to her?

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.380
All right. When she returns,

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.660
I'll share these snacks with her.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.120
She'll surely smile then.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.450
Come in and have a seat.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.910
Who is this person you've drawn?

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.800
Ms. Wei Jia.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.800
She's only two years older than me.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.760
We used to play together as children.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.840
She's one of the most beautiful women

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.220
in the south of the city.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.320
I remember that

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.630
after she married
into the Dou family of Fufeng,

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.590
her husband became a county magistrate
through family connections.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.960
Unfortunately, just a few months
after their wedding,

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.560
her husband died of illness.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.320
Is that

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.590
why she went mad?

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:16.920
Sit down.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.360
I don't think so.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.740
I heard

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.590
she later remarried a merchant.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:27.590
This caused quite a conflict

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:28.590
with her family.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.760
A merchant?

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.510
Rumor says

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.290
he was one of
the biggest merchants in Chang'an.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.230
That's not quite right.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.440
He Bi is one of

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.760
the biggest merchants in Chang'an.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.020
He looks down on Ma Kui.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.240
What's wrong?

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.470
Don't you know Sheriff Wei?

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.400
Of course I do. We're even relatives.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.030
It couldn't be He Bi, could it?
