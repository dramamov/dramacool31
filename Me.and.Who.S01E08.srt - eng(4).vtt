00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.640
Good morning,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.580
Ya.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.760

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.520
not dreaming, am I?

- Father, hi...
- Hi, Father!

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.360
What are you two doing?

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.360
Father, what can I do for you?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.520
It's about 'The Universe' project.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.960
Today, Master Libidude is free.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.720
I want you to visit
the Dragon's Belly with him.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.240
Of course, Father.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.680
I'll be there.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.680
Alright, and take Apo with you, too.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.400
Huh?

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.840
I need to come?

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.440
I want you to help him
with this project.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.080
Think of this as learning the ropes,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.280
because in the future

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.280
you'll have to support Suriya
in many other ways.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.880
What is 'The Universe Project'?

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.920
It's a mega project

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.910
that combines the mall, the hotel,
and the office into one complex.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.160
A project this big

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.840
will require a lot of land

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.440
and a prime location as well.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.920
That's why Father asked Master Libidude
to help with the feng shui.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.320
When it comes to business,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.040
every possible advantage

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.840
needs to be used

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.400
including feng shui.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.200
Uh...

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.440
Do you want to do this,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.200
the universe mission?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.400
So this is the Dragon's Belly,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.120
a plot of land perfectly aligned with
the Green Dragon from all four directions

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.400
with a Metal element entrance

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.960
that attracts wealth and treasure.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.280
Without a doubt,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.120
this isn't just
an ordinary Dragon's Belly

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.360
but the golden one,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.480
the greatest land
Siao Tawan Group has ever found.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.200
If you claim this, I guarantee you

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.760
flourishing, fortune, and fabulousness.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.560
Father will be so thrilled
if he knows this.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.480
Would you like to have a tour?

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.440

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.960
why do we have to pack our things?

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.440
Didn't you say

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.040
they were just gonna build us a theatre?

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.640
That's right,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.920
but during the construction,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.280
it's gonna be very loud

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.880
and dusty.

We can't stay here in the meantime.

You don't like loud noises,
do you, Phopthorn?

That's why

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.760
you need to move somewhere else,

Right, Master,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.000
please calculate an auspicious date
for the start of the construction.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.440

Bye-bye.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.080
I'm sending someone to find out
who the owner of the land is.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.040
I heard
they were quite a private person,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.040
not usually seen at social events.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.440

wanna know

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.840
why Ashin hates Apo so much.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.800
Why?

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.240
What did Ashin say to you?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.800
I'm just curious, like...

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.580
No matter how nice I am to him,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.240
he never seems to want to accept me.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.640
Is it because

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.360
we have different moms?

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.520
That's why

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560
he hates me.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.805
I don't think...

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.560
that's the reason he hates Apo.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.280
It's likely
because of Apo's personality.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.000
I vividly remember

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.641
that one time

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.160
when Apo told Ashin,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.640
"You're just a son of a side chick.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.960
Don't stick your nose in."

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.240
Really?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.840
That's freaking harsh!

Even though...

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.200
that wasn't directed at me,
it still hurts.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And what about you?

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.800
Have you ever hated Apo?

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.840
I've never hated him

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.840
because of my mind-reading ability.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.680

that everyone expresses
themselves differently.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.200
Damn!

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.560
You act like you own the place, man.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.404
- Hm?
- What?

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.760
You told me to make myself at home.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.320
Alright.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.800
Hey, that's a new arrival!

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.600
A rom-com

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.600
about a man who realizes

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.560
that his best friend can read minds,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.240
even though all he's been thinking about

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.880
is wanting to have sex
with him just once.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.000
What the hell is that?

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.680
Let's go with this one.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.120
It's gonna be deep.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.560
After all this time being friends,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.530
I've never met anyone

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.720
who knows me as well as you do.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.080
But from now on,

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.800
we won't be seeing each other
for a while.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.640
Do you have anything
to tell me for the last time?

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.840
If you don't dare to say it,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.560
then don't say anything at all.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.800
I'm sorry.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.040
I...

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.680
I've been reading your mind
all this time.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.320
Ever since the day
I pushed you on the swing,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.880
I've known

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.600
you wanted to sleep with me.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.160
I'm sorry for leading you on.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.280
I thought
I was onto you this whole time,

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.800
but in reality, I...

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.560
barely know you at all.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.280
Can you please not go?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.400
Please...

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.600
I promise

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.440
I'll never read your mind again.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.380
Can I...

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.720
ask you a favor?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.160
Can we

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.280
go back to being friends again?

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.920
No fucking way!

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.840
Bro, chill out.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.080
Is this your life story or what?

Tor...

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.960
- Hm?
- Do you think

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.600
some people can actually read minds?

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.960
Are you drunk?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.600
But I think

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.880
I wouldn't be friends with them
if they really could.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.280
It's way too creepy.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.820
Let's have some ice cream.

There are so many flavors here.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.220
What should I get?

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.880
My absolute favorite is
mint chocolate.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.800
Hm...

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720
How about mint chocolate?

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.080
It's pretty refreshing.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.440
I think you're gonna like it.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.280
Whoa, how does he know that?

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.680
Isn't that too coincidental?

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.320
You're pretty madly in love
with your fiancé, aren't you?

- Yeah!

but the other night

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.120
he turned himself in,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.240
with evidence from the dash cam

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.200

are responsible for the car crash.

You've been on the run for months.

Why did you turn yourself in
all of a sudden?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.160
I was just...

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.440
hired as a scapegoat,
serving a few years in jail

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.360
in exchange for a lifetime of money.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.640

won't have to struggle.

I'm thinking

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.160
that you're secretly reading my mind.

I hate this freaking ice cream?

The only reason
I was thinking about it

was just to test you.

I don't want you to cheat
and read my mind like this anymore.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.070
So, if you do...

nod for me.

I'm sorry.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.160
I just thought

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.160
I'd found someone who truly knew me.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.240
In the end,

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.920
a sidekick like me

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.080
is just a toy to someone like you.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.600
It's not like that, Tai.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.600
Let me explain...

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.240
I looked into the day
Mr. Apo got hit by a car

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.320
and the day the Yue family received
a suspicious package.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.400
I found a potential suspect.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.040
Who?

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.280
Mr. Ashin.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.200
I have prepared
the documents for you.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.960
Please open
the desk's drawer to find them.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.880
Every time I went to the crime scene,

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.640
I saw Ashin

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.520
sneaking around in the same spot.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.880
And with my ability,

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.480
I stalked him,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.440
which brought us to what you see now.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.960
After that,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.840
the police called to tell me

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.920
that the evidence
in Mr. Apo's case has vanished.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.920
Are you sure?

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.040
I then went to look for more evidence

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.120
from the dash cam of the car
that traveled the same route

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.360
on the day of his accident.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.840
I found a luxury car,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.240
and only a few of this model
exist in Thailand.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.960
One of the owners

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.480
is Ashin.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.320
From what I'm thinking,

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.100
our target is going to
strike again for sure.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.840
Really?

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.120
Uh, let me help you with that.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.400
No, thank you.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.920
Oh, there he is,

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.520
carrying some kind of bags.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.480
It seems important.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.200
Trust me.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.200
That bag...

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.320
carries important evidence.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.800
Ashin!

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.760
M.R. Ya?

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.880
How did you get here?

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.400
Uh, I...

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.520
I'm running errands around here, so...

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.160
Are you alright?

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.480
Where did you get that necklace?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.000
I've never seen you wear it before.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.040
My friend bought it for me.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.040
Why?

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.040
Nothing, it's just...

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.200
It's beautiful.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.680
Excuse me.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.250
Uh...

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.680
Uh, Ashin!

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:27.960
Hey!

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.160
What are you gonna do?

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.840
Ya.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.400
Ya?

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.160
Mother brought some soup for you.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.360
Where are you off to, Ya?

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.760
Whoa,

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.520
look at all his work.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.600
He must be so tired.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.160
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.840
If you get tired,
come get a hug from me.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.360
[Apo's Case]

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.400
[Apo's Case]

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.760
This is Ashin...

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.720
I'm out talking business.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.080
See you this afternoon.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.720
Phopthorn!

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.640
You're fine now.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.560
I'm right here.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.160
I talked to the driver on your behalf.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.920
Luckily, it was just an accident.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.680
I thought
someone was gonna hurt you again.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.520
Hurt me?

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.760
Who's gonna hurt me again?

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.560
Well,

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.580
that one's in jail now, right?

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.280
Or do you mean Ashin?

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.440
I saw the case file in your room, Ya.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.160
I'm sorry

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.680
that I've been
hiding this from you, Thorn.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.600
I just didn't want to worry you.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160
And yes,

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.360
I do suspect Ashin.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.640
I don't think it's him, though.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.200
He might hate Apo,

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.640
but...

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.440
I don't think

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.080
he's gonna do that to Apo.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.600
How could we be sure?

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.120
Should we prove his innocence?

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.920
Hi, there.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.200
I'd like to have...

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.840
One egg noodles with
extra roasted red pork, no cilantro.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.120
I'll have one rice noodle with
extra roasted red pork, no cilantro.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.160
Thank you.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.360
I didn't read your mind earlier.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.500
Actually,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.280
it only works when our eyes meet.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.920
Auntie,

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.040
can I get the rice noodles
I ordered earlier

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.600
for takeout?

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.640
Sure.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.240
I'm sorry.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.600
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.880
I admit, I cheated by reading your mind.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.760
But because of that,
I got to know you better,

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.380
and I just want to know you even more.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.000
The more I do,

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.840
the more my feelings for you grow.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.440
Tai...

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.360
Do you really have feelings for me,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.800
or are you just having fun

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.240
making a fool out of me?

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.400
Hm?

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.080
Forget it.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.920
Even though
you've been reading my mind,

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.280
you never really know me.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480
Here you go.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.120
Thank you.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.550
Tai...

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.880
Tailah.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.200
Tai.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.440
You like egg noodles
with roasted red pork

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.720
and no cilantro.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.120
You don't like coffee,
but you do like tea.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.040
Hey,

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.280
I can drink it,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.120
but I'm not in love with it.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.400
You're a great cook and bartender.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.120
Whenever you eat something delicious

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.960
or get something done,

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.920
your eyes widen automatically.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.520
You might not realize it,

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.200
but whenever you're nervous,

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.640
you always nudge your glasses up
with your finger.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:51.770
Hey,

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.840
just because you know
what I like to eat or drink,

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.480
how good I am at cooking,

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.360
or how I act,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.400
it doesn't mean you really know me.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.680
You always care
about other people's feelings,

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.280
but they never know about yours.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.200
You said you were a sidekick
in your friend group,

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.600
but to me, you're not just that.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:20.840
Tai...

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:28.840
Tai!

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.800
This is an amethyst necklace.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.240
It protects you from mind-reading.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.600
It's for you.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.040
I want you to believe

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.480
that I really do want to get to know you

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.280
without reading your mind.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.120
Can you give me another chance?

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.520
Madam.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.960
- Oh!
- Hello.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.320
Hello, there.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.880
There's my lovey-dovey couple.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.400
Look, I'm trying to get in shape

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.000
for your wedding.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.040
Wow...

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.400
very fit.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:58.920
Hey,

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.400
judging from how you're both here...

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.440
Is something going on?

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.600
Uh...

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.600
- Hm?
- Uh...

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.080
How about this?

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.440
Let's do some ice-breaking activities.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.280
Come on!

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.680
Is this Apo's largest outfit?

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.520
Yeah...

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.560
The way it looks on you

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.720
is pretty cute.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.620
Thorn, this is making you laugh.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.200
- Come this way.
- What the heck, Papa?!

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.960
- There you go, Ashin!
- I told you I didn't wanna dance!

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.600
Come on!

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.240
Join our family activity for once.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.000
Acting all stubborn.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.920
- Let's go!
- I'm picking one right now!

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.000
What about this one?

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.680
- That looks fun.
- What's with you?

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.570
Good?

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480
You, too.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.400
You both piss me off!

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.360
No wonder a hot mess
belongs in a dumpster fire!

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.520
What?

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.520
Why are you
playing around like children?

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.440
Come here!

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.480
Time to work out!

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.920
- Come on!
- Yeah.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.760
- Yeah, we're still young.
- Go!

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.700
One,

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.720
two,

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.480
three,

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.440
- four,
- Four,

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.320
- five,
- five,

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.280
- six,
- six,

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.120
- seven,
- seven.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.920
eight!

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.520
- Two!
- Ow, ow!

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.920
- Three!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.240
- Ouch! Ouch!
- What's going on?

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.800
- I'm hurt! I have a cramp!
- Oh!

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.720
- The cramps...
- It's the cramp, Ya?!

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.920
- It is!
- No! What should we do?

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.600
You're not as fit as I expected!

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.200
Three, four...

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.200
When Ya dresses like this,

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.640
he looks kinda wacky.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.320
You okay, M.R. Ya?

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.120
Uh, I'm better.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.240
Thanks.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.440
Next up, let's do some squats!

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.680
Let's go!

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.640
One,

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.200
two...

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.400
Uh, Mama?

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.200
Huh?

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.600
The squats...

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.400
kinda remind me of driving.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.120
Yeah, you're right about that.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.240
Then, let's hit the road, shall we?

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.600
Give me a vroom!

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.160
Let's ride!

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.560
Ow, ow, ow! The cramp!

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.680
- Uh...
- It's on my calf!

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.200
- Oh, no! The cramp!
- That really hurts!

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.560
- Don't let go!
- Ya, are you okay?!

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.080
- M.R. Ya!
- Goodness!

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:35.840
Ow! Don't let go of your hands!

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.440
- Don't let go!
- It hurts so bad!

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.160
Can you give me a massage?

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.200
Uh, speaking of driving...

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.320
what happened to the person
who hit me with the car?

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.680
That one...

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.360
- was arrested, dear.
- Mm!

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.320
Oh, really?

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.080
- Yeah!
- Right...

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.400
I tricked Papa and Mama
into believing the bad guy was caught...

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.440
All of a sudden, why did Apo
become curious about the accident?

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.680
Is he suspicious of anything?

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.480
M.R. Ya,

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.840
you've been stretching for too long.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880
You should get better.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.920
Come on, let's get into a stretch.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.800
Quick!

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.960
Alright, stand up straight, guys!

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.200
Let's start.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.640
Stretch your arms up.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.280
Go all the way.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.080
No need to avoid me, Ashin.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.640
I know the truth.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.960
The truth?

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.120

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.800
About that...

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.880
you are behind all this.
