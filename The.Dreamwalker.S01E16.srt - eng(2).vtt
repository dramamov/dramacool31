00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:08.400
Found it.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.480
I finally found it.

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:12.720
Turns out, the treasure I sought

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.239
was always hidden in this village.

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:39.760
And you’re still not scared off?

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:41.480
Rooster crows, lamp dies, no touching gold.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.680
A Gou is here to score big.

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:50.639
Let me take a look.

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:51.919
What’s going on?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.800
What’s the situation here?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.760
No hesitation.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.480
The treasure must be inside.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.960
Oh my goodness!

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.720
The person we just mentioned—

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.639
Do you know him?

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.839
I know him.

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:34.279
He’s from out of town.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.559
Don’t be fooled by his glasses and manners.

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:37.919
He’s a grave robber.

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:39.880
How do you know he robs graves?

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.119
Do you know where we are?

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.679
This is an ancient capital of the Central Plains.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.440
Tombs and graves everywhere.

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:46.919
Grave robbers all over the place.

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.880
When he first arrived in town,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.800
he sneakily asked me about

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.399
the locations of Xiaoshang Village’s tombs.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.240
Later on,

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.639
he dug holes every day.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.679
If he’s not a grave robber,

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:56.880
what else could he be?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.839
Exactly, exactly.

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.679
He often came to our shop

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.279
to ask about ancient tombs.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.279
No wonder he died so strangely.

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:04.000
For sure,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.759
he must’ve angered something unclean in the tomb.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.639
Don’t believe every rumor.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.039
It was that grave robber—

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.960
He broke the rules.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.520
Took what he shouldn’t have.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.759
That’s why he was cursed.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.279
A curse?

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:17.919
Yes, a curse.

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:19.520
That grave robber’s body—

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.360
didn’t you and Wang Mazi find it together?

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.399
Tell us about it.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.000
That night,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.279
I shouldn’t have cut through the graveyard.

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.919
Hurry up, hurry up!

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.240
Look at you, so scared.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.639
There aren’t any new graves here.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.880
Just ancient tombs everywhere.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.600
Grave robbers have dug them all up.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.720
Nothing to be afraid of.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.199
Let’s go.

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.119
Who’s scared?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.639
It’s late at night—

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:52.800
I can’t see the path.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.639
Wait for me!

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080
What’s that?

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.919
A person.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.399
How could a person float?

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.839
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.559
A ghost!

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:10.360
That’s a ghost!

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.559
Come on, come on!

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.799
Such a coward.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.320
Always scaring yourself.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.959
Look over here.

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:33.040
It’s just a scarecrow.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.160
Nothing scary about it.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.040
See?

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.160
So timid.

00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:41.000
Who’s crazy enough

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.279
to tie a scarecrow to a tree?

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.920
Go.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.519
A ghost!

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:50.200
Its eyes are gone.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.160
Blood’s coming out of every orifice.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.279
It was terrifying.

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:54.799
This Mr. Luo—

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.959
he used to visit my shop often.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.679
Now he’s died so horribly.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.160
It’s really frightening.

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:02.760
So, Mr. Luo’s body—

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.640
where is it now?

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.720
It’s that person.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.519
Is there only one body?

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.359
Yes.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.920
Has the body been examined?

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:16.559
Prince,

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:18.839
our Patrol and Inspection Office

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:20.720
doesn’t have a coroner.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.320
But don’t worry.

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.399
I’ll get someone from the county right away.

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:26.519
Let me take a look first.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.480
No coroner?

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.640
Then is there anyone

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.079
who can investigate crimes?

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.040
Prince,

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.640
in our area,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.440
him and me,

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:56.440
there are five of us.

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:03.720
Prince, rest assured.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.959
Our Patrol and Inspection Office is small,

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:07.920
but we never slack off.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.320
These are the things from his luggage.

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:13.160
Go ahead,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.799
what have you all found?

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.920
Don’t tell me after all these days,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.040
you’ve found nothing.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.720
Prince,

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:23.720
everyone in town says

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.480
he robbed a tomb he shouldn’t have.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.239
He broke a taboo, that’s why this happened.

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:31.959
You saw his body too.

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:34.519
This is no ordinary death.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.799
Definitely not ordinary.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.839
His eyes were gouged out.

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:42.519
His limbs were broken.

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:44.160
He was tortured before death.

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:47.799
This was done by a person.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.279
Ghosts don’t have time for that.

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:52.320
What kind of grudge

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:53.839
would lead to such torture?

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:02.880
We’ll only know after we investigate.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:05.679
Luo Yurong has been here for two months.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.079
Has he offended anyone here,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.399
or maybe

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.559
gotten into any trouble?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.959
Actually, there is someone.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.200
That guy—

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:15.119
He’s definitely provoked him.

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:17.480
It’s like a leech you can’t shake off.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.480
Really persistent.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.959
Watch where you’re going!

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.519
Fragrant pear.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.679
Fragrant pear.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.720
Master Jiao.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.559
Fragrant pear, fragrant pear.

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.760
Master Jiao, grab two pears to eat.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:29.720
Go on, go.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.160
Don’t mess around with me.

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:32.559
I’ll pay you.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.760
Stop trying to trick me.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.480
I said I’ll pay you.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.239
This, this—

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:36.160
I’ve got money.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.920
Two copper coins.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.519
Two coins, right?

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:38.119
Two copper coins.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.320
If you can catch me,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.239
I’ll give you the money.

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:46.720
You, you—

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:48.760
I won’t give it to you.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.720
You filthy grave robber, trying to trick me!

00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:54.399
Get lost!

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.640
I’m not a grave robber.

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:04.359
Over there.

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.040
You dirtied my pear.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:06.880
So, what now?

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:07.600
I—

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.320
I’ll wipe it for you.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.920
My back

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.959
got hurt by your lousy box too.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.040
So, what now?

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.640
I—

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.880
I’ll help you to the clinic.

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.200
Consultation fee.

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.880
You have to pay me first.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.520
Otherwise, you’ll run off.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.919
How would I find you then?

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.000
Right, stranger?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.000
A Gou.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.520
What are you up to?

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.440
Up to your usual tricks again?

00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:46.280
No.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.239
His box hit and hurt me.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.039
He should pay my medical bills, right?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.159
Right now I—

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.039
This, this—

00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:56.080
It really hurts.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.359
See?

00:08:57.359 --> 00:08:57.719
Faking it.

00:08:57.799 --> 00:08:58.679
Keep pretending.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:08:59.799
It hurts just because you say so?

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.320
Ignore him.

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:03.479
He’s the local thug.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.159
Stay away from him in the future.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:06.799
Go on.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.679
Thanks, thanks.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:10.880
Don’t go!

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.400
Damn grave robber!

00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:12.559
What did you do?

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.479
I just told you,

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:16.400
his box hit my back.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.280
Don’t pull me, don’t pull me!

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.719
I’ll let go, fine.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:23.559
Stop doing shady things.

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:25.919
Make our town proud for once.

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:26.679
Alright, alright.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:27.840
Let’s go.

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.280
Fine, I’m leaving.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.280
Damn fool.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.440
Just go die already!

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.159
You dare hit me? Go on, hit!

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.359
You must have a death wish!

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:36.760
Prince.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.799
Prince, this is A Gou’s home.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:39.679
This kid

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.840
is a notorious local thug.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.000
Always cheating, stealing, causing trouble.

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:45.559
Never does anything decent.

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:50.400
This dream isn’t Luo Yurong’s.

00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:51.919
It’s A Gou’s.

00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:53.880
Then he probably—

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.799
Something’s wrong.

00:09:55.119 --> 00:09:55.640
Prince.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.159
What happened here?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.200
Looks like a robbery.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.840
Or maybe he ran off.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.719
No, he didn’t.

00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:11.440
There’s a weapon mark here.

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:13.760
It looks odd.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.960
Not a knife.

00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:16.400
Not a sword either.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.719
A dart?

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.359
Not quite.

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:22.039
Really strange mark.

00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:23.440
Where have I seen this before?

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.440
Prince.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.520
Prince.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.599
This belongs to Luo Yurong.

00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:28.400
I’ve seen it.

00:10:34.479 --> 00:10:35.320
Case solved!

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:36.960
A Gou definitely did this.

00:10:37.479 --> 00:10:39.159
He stole Luo Yurong’s stuff first,

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:40.599
then killed Luo Yurong,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.119
and finally fled in fear.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.119
That’s all there is.

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:47.840
Nothing else.

00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:50.880
That’s it.

00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:53.280
Go check for more clues.

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:00.840
The punishment on Luo Yurong

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.840
was very precise.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.719
No way a thug like A Gou

00:11:04.719 --> 00:11:05.679
could pull that off.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.080
Now it seems

00:11:07.479 --> 00:11:09.280
there’s another force involved.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.679
They’re searching for something.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:11.799
Chasing down Luo Yurong.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.080
And judging by the dream,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.840
it seems more like

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.799
A Gou stole Luo Yurong’s belongings.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.520
Our top priority now

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.880
is to figure out

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.760
what Luo Yurong came to Xiaoshang Village for,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.679
and to find A Gou’s body.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:33.840
Prince.

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:36.440
You have four officers here,

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440
plus me,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.919
that’s five.

00:11:43.359 --> 00:11:44.080
In the county,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.919
there should be a squad of Imperial Guards.

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:49.840
Take my badge and call them over.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.440
Have them search for A Gou’s body.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.280
A Gou is dead.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.000
You want me to summon the Imperial Guards?

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:00.080
Yes, sir.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.159
So that means,

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.039
Luo Yurong must have found something

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.039
extraordinarily rare treasure.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.719
That's why he was hunted down.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.440
Based on the clues we have now,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.799
A Gou's obsession

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.239
should also be related to this item.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.840
What exactly is this thing?

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.559
Someone is following us.
