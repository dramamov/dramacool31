00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.360
- (Previously on "Player")
- I’m starting to think

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.280
there’s definitely something going on
between Pun and Ploy.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.040
No need to go all out.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.000
I just want the proposal to finally happen.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.600
We just ran into Phetai.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.160
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.280
I’m sorry.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.720
When will you be free next?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.720
I won’t.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.080
I won’t ask
why you let someone do that to you.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.480
If you are angry,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.520
then at least show it.
Let me know somehow.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.200
Come to Hong Kong with me.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.960
I’ll go!

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.720
Anywhere you ask, I’ll go.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.840
Who's this?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.760
“Your soon-to-be husband, of course.”

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.120
Phetai?

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.040
Um, Ploy.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.400
Well...

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.880
I’ve got an urgent errand.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.760
Could you wait for me at the airport?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.360
I’ll sort it out quickly
and come straight over.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.280
Want me to drop you off?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.480
Then we can go together.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.880
Oh, no, it’s fine.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.160
You can just wait in the lounge and relax.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.880
I’ll be there in a bit. I’ll come right after.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.760
Okay?

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.280
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.960
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.480
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.360
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.680
♫ The closer we become ♫

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.840
♫ The more my heart’s undone ♫

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.840
♫ It trembles more each time we meet as one ♫

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.440
♫ Game for your love ♫

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.120
♫ But I’m a pro player, baby ♫

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.240
♫ I wish you’d slip and show your heart to me ♫

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.560
♫ But somehow, I can always see it clearly ♫

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.840
♫ I try so hard to hold my heart inside
But in the end, I can’t stop loving you so right ♫

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.320
♫ Game Over ♫

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.440
What would you like?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.920
Chamomile tea, please.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.840
Sure.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.400
Ugh. Where are you?

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.920
(”Phetai”)

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.560
I’m sorry. We’re closing now.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.600
You can go ahead and bill me.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.240
Thank you.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.360
Hello, Phe?

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.720
Where are you? Why didn’t you show up?

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.360
“Pun. Can we move it to tonight?”

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.520
Why do you keep doing this to me?

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.600
Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for you?

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.120
“11 p.m., Pun.”

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.360
“At the bar, where we bumped into
each other by the door.”

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.360
“You remember, right?”

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.120
Hang on, Phe…

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.760
(sighs)

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.440
“Go see Ploy, Pun.”

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.760
We already had plans.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.560
What about that million, Pun?

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.240
Don’t forget! We’ve got to get that back.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.800
But how upset would Ploy be?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.960
We’ve planned this trip for so long.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.360
And what about Prang? How would she feel?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.520
If she knew we gave a million
to some random guy.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.280
Does that even matter right now?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.120
Ploy’s been at the airport
waiting all by herself for hours.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.280
Come up with a good reason and tell her.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.000
A reason? You mean a lie?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.880
No, I mean

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.520
prioritize things.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.800
Hmm. So are you really going
to let Ploy go to Hong Kong alone?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.720
Then don’t let her go yet.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.440
Tell her to wait and go together.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.280
Make up any excuse you need.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.520
Just stall for now.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.400
Think about Ploy’s feelings for once, Pun.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.200
And think about that million too.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.040
Okay, enough! Both of you, stop.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.800
I’ll decide.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720
Have you arrived yet, Pun?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.320
“Hello. Ploy.”

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.560
Well,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.760
I really couldn’t sort the errand out.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.200
Can we move our flight
to Hong Kong tomorrow?

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.040
Can you give me a clearer reason, Pun?

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.880
I just have to redo all my work from scratch.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.400
But I really can go to Hong Kong with you.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.600
“If it’s about the money, or any costs,”

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.840
“I’ll take care of it myself.”

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.040
Ploy. Please don’t stay silent.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.159
And what do you want me to say, Pun?

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.560
Anything. Just whatever you’re thinking.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.520
Get back to work.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.000
Hong Kong can wait.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.520
Are you mad at me, Ploy?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.080
“Ploy.”

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.200
We’ll talk when we see each other, okay?

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.840
Then let’s have dinner tonight.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
“I’ll book new tickets right away.”

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.000
We’ll talk later.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.280
Hey.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.600
Prang, when are you coming home?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.560
I miss you so much.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.520
Just finished work. Heading back now.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.360
Have you eaten?

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840
“Not yet.”

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.840
I was waiting to eat with you.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.080
Is that okay?

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.080
Sure. I’ll make your favorite.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.280
Pun?

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.280
“Prang.”

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.960
“Hello? Can you hear me?”

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.480
“Prang.”

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.160
“Why so quiet?”

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.920
Oh, nothing.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.039
Just ran into Pun.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.679
Don’t tell me she’s getting drunk again,
that crazy girl.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.200
Um, Jay, I’ll call you back.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.600
Prang. Wait!

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.640
(”Will you marry me?”)

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.040
Ouch!

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.960
Where is it? The money you stole from me.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.640
Shh. Keep it down, Pun.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.920
Give it back so I can get out of here.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.280
Can we just talk?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.120
I don’t care

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.960
what you’ve done.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.640
But do you know I got beaten up?

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.600
I’m not even your girlfriend.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.320
When will you stop
dragging everyone else down with you?

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.360
Pun. Calm down. Okay? I...

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.400
I didn’t mean for this to happen. I swear.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.040
How was I supposed to know
they’d come after you to the house, Pun?

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.840
Then why did you run?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.440
If I didn’t, I’d be dead, Pun.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.200
Take responsibility for what you did.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.680
At least, didn’t you think to warn me first?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.680
Pun.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.200
I didn’t want anyone to be involved. Okay?

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.000
Phe...

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.480
You’re so damn selfish.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.160
You’re lucky they didn’t follow you back to Thailand.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.400
You really think

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.040
I have to live like this,
hiding all the time, for no reason?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.160
Think about why.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.080
I think you’re just running from debt.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.040
Let me tell you from the start.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.760
“I was gambling.”

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.760
“No one in New York even knew
I was going to the casino.”

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.720
“At first, it was just to blow off some steam.”

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.360
Raise.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.600
“I didn’t play that much,
not enough to get myself in trouble.”

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.320
“Winning, losing... It was all fun.”

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.800
Call.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.440
All in.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.600
“Until one day it wasn’t,”

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.240
“I got cocky, thought my luck was turning,
so I kept betting more and more.”

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.960
Full house!

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.280
Looks like great ties.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
“And in the end,”

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.240
“I lost everything to them.”

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.800
“After that,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.920
it became about trying to win it back.”

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.960
“Keep telling myself I’d win it all back.”

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.720
I really need to talk to Martin.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.840
“So I tried borrowing money from the casino owner.”

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.120
“What? You wanted to see me?”

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.760
“Hold on.”

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.880
What’s with you?

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.720
Thai voiceover by Phetai.
Does it sound weird?

00:11:59.240 --> 00:11:59.960
For what?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.160
Okay, okay. Fine.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.960
Anyway,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.240
“Martin owns the casino I played at.”

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.920
“Big-time mafia boss in New York.”

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.280
What do you want?

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.880
“Of course. I needed money.”

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.520
“And one day,”

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.160
“I was desperate enough
to sign a loan agreement with insane interest.”

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.880
(”Loan Agreement”)

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.760
(”Total of Payments $65,000
Annual Percentage Rate 10%”)

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.840
“But it wasn’t as simple as
just paying the money back.”

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.320
“I’d already booked a flight out beforehand.”

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.480
- “I didn’t trust those guys.”
- Please don’t shoot me.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.800
- I’ll get you the money as soon as possible. Please don’t shoot me.
- “In case something went wrong, I could get away fast.”

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.160
You’d better get me the money.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.240
“But if nothing bad happened,
It’d be like a vacation trip back home.”

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.760
- “And of course, something went wrong.”
- You understand that, right?

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.240
If you do not pay me,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.520
your girlfriend...

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.800
dies.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.640
So I had no choice but to run back to Thailand.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.880
But who would’ve thought their network
reached all the way here too?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.240
That’s why I’ve been living like this,
hiding all the time.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.440
And that one million baht you took from me,

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.600
it didn’t help clear your debt at all?

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.440
What about Golf’s money?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.920
Be honest. How much do you actually owe?

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.680
It helped, but…

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.320
the interest rates are insane, Pun.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.400
Even after paying some back, I still owe him.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.800
It’s quite a lot.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.080
Then why did you meet Golf that day?

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.120
Because I knew he was messing around with you.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.760
So I decided to pay him back myself

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.240
and told him to stay away from you.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.400
How did it go, Jay?

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.280
Hey. Why are you here alone?

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.520
Prang had something urgent,

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.800
so she’s running a bit late.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.720
It’s okay. It’s okay.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.280
Have you ordered yet?

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.760
Want me to get something for you?

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.600
Phe.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.880
Hmm?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.480
There’s one more thing.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.320
What is it?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.600
Have you been in touch with your sister lately?

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.440
Well...

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.440
Yeah. We still talk sometimes.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.720
At first, I even asked Ploy for help.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.480
Then,

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.880
once you’re done with me,

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.480
can you stop asking Ploy for help too?

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.680
Pun...

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.160
Ploy’s my sister.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.000
- You can’t just tell me to stop seeing my own sister…
- I mean...

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.560
Stop getting her involved in your mess.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.080
I’ve been working with the police
to put those guys behind bars.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.480
Once it’s done, I’ll...

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.000
probably head back to the States.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.200
And that’ll be the end of it.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.120
So…

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.600
Okay.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.520
Okay.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.880
I’ve transferred the money back to you.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.840
And...

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.320
Do you still want that citizenship?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.760
Huh?

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.920
American citizenship.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.800
This time, I won’t...

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.400
I won’t charge you a single baht.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.520
Think of it as payback
for everything I’ve done to you.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.440
You really think...

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.320
I’m stupid enough

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.120
to let you fool me twice?

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.040
Try thinking about that.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.600
I’ll get in touch.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.800
Ah. Excuse me, ma’am.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.440
I’m sorry, but...

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.000
you’re acting a bit suspicious for a while now.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.599
Huh?

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:13.680
Um. There must be some kind of misunderstanding.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.800
A misunderstanding?

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.160
If it’s just a misunderstanding,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.359
then why are you acting so strange?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.680
Am I good to go?

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.320
Ah! Oh my god, Prang!

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.800
You’re Prang Punnaputch, right?

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.160
Wow. You look even prettier in person!

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.600
I’ve been dying to get your autograph!

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.440
I’m gonna show it off to
my girls, my stans, and everyone!

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.640
Seriously, they can recite every line
from your shows by heart!

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.760
Can I have your autograph, please?

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.280
Sure, sure. Where should I sign?

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.120
Umm…

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.760
Right here.
Make it fierce and fabulous. Okay?

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.640
Is this alright, Jay?

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.800
So, what’s the plan this time?

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.080
Here’s the thing, Jae Ang.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.680
When Prang gets here, right?

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.520
I’ll bring her to sit here.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.760
Then I’ll serve her the food.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.600
And when she lifts the lid,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.120
she’ll find the ring I hid inside.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.000
Then I’ll…

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.080
What’s wrong, Jay?

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.800
It’s not too cliché, is it?

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.560
No, I think it’s perfect.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.320
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.640
“Please leave your message after the beep.”

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.840
“Hello?”

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.080
Hello, Ji.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.240
I can’t get through to Ploy at all.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.440
Are you with her right now?

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.200
“Didn’t Ploy go to Hong Kong with you, Pun?”

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.920
Wait...

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.560
Didn’t you drop her off at the condo this morning?

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.960
“No.”

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.920
“When we got to the airport
and finished unloading her luggage,”

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.840
“she told me to head back.”

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.280
(”Ploy Pitcha: Hong Kong. 3 hour ago.”)

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.120
What’s up, Pun?

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800
Hello, Jieab.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.280
Hey.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.840
I think I’m going crazy.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.360
What’s wrong with you?

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.960
I went to see a play.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.200
Oh? And then?

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.680
And…

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.320
there’s this one scene where

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.480
the leads are supposed to fly to Hong Kong together.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.440
“But on the morning of the trip,”

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.080
the lead guy says he has urgent work,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.120
so he can’t go with her.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.880
And the girl says, “Get back to work.”

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.960
“Hong Kong can wait.”

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.920
Mm. And then?

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.840
If you were her, would you be mad at him?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.280
I think I would,

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.520
“if he told me that last minute.”

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.360
So was he really busy?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.480
Yeah, he was.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.760
Are you okay, Pun?

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.440
Why does your voice sound shaky?

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.160
Do you think…

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.520
someone can give up on a relationship that easily?

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.360
I guess it depends on the person
and how strong the relationship is.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.480
“Are you okay?”

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.000
- “Pun?”
- Huh?

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.440
I’m totally fine.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.600
Well,

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.840
I really need to get back to work.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.280
Let’s talk later, alright?

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.520
“Pun.”

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.880
“Pun.”

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.600
I’m heading out now.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.560
Okay. Thanks so much.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.680
Hope everything works out for you.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.320
It will. Don’t worry.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.760
Get home safe.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.480
Good luck, Jay.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:29.880
Ugh!

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.320
Why’s the traffic so bad right now?

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.680
Come on. Pick up, Ploy.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.680
Hello, Jay?

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.240
I’m on my way back. Just wait a bit, okay?

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.600
What happened just now, Prang?

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.240
You sounded so freaked out.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.840
I’ll tell you when I get back.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.200
I’m in a hurry right now.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.600
Ugh. Why’s it jammed now?

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.640
Is it something serious, Prang?

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.080
I said I’ll tell you later!

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.520
Do you get that, Jay?

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.160
“Let me focus on driving first.”

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.120
Okay, I...

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.040
- “Please leave your message after the beep.”
- No. Ploy. Don’t do this to me.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.560
I love you.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.240
(”Will you marry me?”)

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:13.640
Prang,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.320
How did you get in here?

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.800
This is my room.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.400
Why did you do this, Pun?

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.400
Do what?

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.280
Why didn’t you tell me what was going on?

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.120
What are you talking about?

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.440
I just came back from the bar.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.320
Then I guess you already know

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.480
I got the money back.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.480
Wait!

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120
Let’s talk first.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.280
There’s nothing to talk about.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.240
This is serious.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.600
We need to talk to Dad.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.640
Do you think you can sort it yourself?

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.240
I’m not worried about the money.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.960
I’m worried about you.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.880
Prang. Just stop trying to fix things for me.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.320
You and Dad...

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.040
have never expected anything from me anyway.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.320
What are you talking about?

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.040
I have to go, Prang.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.840
If we’re going to fight about this, let’s do it later.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:53.840
Wait!

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.840
Just stop messing with me already.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.280
You’re back, Prang?

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.600
What happened?

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.400
Let’s go.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.920
Pun?

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.520
You’re travelling around here too?

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.040
Are you staying here, Dream?

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.040
Yes. We’re staying here.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.840
Is that your bag, Pun?

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.840
Did you just get here?

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.240
Wow…

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.640
What a coincidence.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.400
So, you just arrived, right?

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.480
I’ve been here for a while, actually.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.760
But the person I came to see,
I can't reach her at all.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.720
I’ve been sitting here for hours,
waiting for nothing certain.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.000
Then would you like to stay here, Pun?

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.800
- I can make the arrangements.
- It’s alright.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.120
I can handle it myself.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.520
In that case, we’ll get going.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.840
Ploy’s exhausted.
She’s been complaining the whole ride.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.000
We’ll go ahead. Come on.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520
Ploy.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.680
I haven’t eaten yet.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.880
Dream. You go up first.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.240
I’ll take her to the restaurant.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.680
- Then let me come too.
- Dream. Just go up first.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.080
Please.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.640
Alright.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.480
See you later.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.840
Let’s go eat.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.520
Why couldn’t I reach you at all, Ploy?

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.480
And how did she even get here?

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.320
Let’s go eat.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.720
Is she staying with you?

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.280
But this trip was supposed to be ours.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.760
You mean the trip you refused to come on?

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.240
I told you, Ploy,

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.320
we were supposed to go together.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.840
I’ll take care of all the expenses myself.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.440
And why’s that?

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.640
Because you were too busy with work?

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:42.960
Yes.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.360
Eat.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.520
Aren’t you hungry?

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.360
Ploy…

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.159
Yes?

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.320
Ploy.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:22.960
Just say it.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.880
I know I was wrong.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.239
But are you really not going to look at me?

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.560
We’ll talk later.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.360
Ploy.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.200
Did you really have to do that?

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.520
It just fell.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.720
I didn’t throw it away.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.320
And you’re really not going to care at all?

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.520
What if I told you Dream’s staying with me?

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.760
What would you say then?

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.880
I’d book another room

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.960
and take you with me.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.240
Should I book another room?

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.640
Ploy…

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.520
I’m sorry for bailing on the trip.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.600
Sorry for being late.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.040
I didn’t mean to.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.520
Please don’t be mad at me anymore.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.680
So…

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.680
you took me out for dinner,

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.480
brought me up to your room,

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.680
just to talk to me without even looking at me?

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.600
You’re Prang’s sister. I have to look after you.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.080
What did you just...

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.800
Go take a shower and get some rest.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.240
Well.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.920
I’ll unpack first.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.960
You go shower, Ploy.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.600
Didn’t you say you were exhausted?

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.760
(knocking on door)

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.840
(knocking on door)

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.240
(knocking on door)

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.200
(knocking on door)

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.880
(knocking on door)

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.720
Who are you looking for?

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.640
Isn’t this Ploy’s room?

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.480
Oh! There she is.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.880
Ploy, it’s Pinky. I’m here like we agreed.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.320
Get out.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.720
Get out!

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.600
Ploy. Please tell me I’m wrong about this.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.440
You didn’t call her here to sleep with you, did you?

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.960
I’ve had a long day, Pun.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.280
How could you do this to me?

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.560
What about you?

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.400
What did I do wrong?

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.200
Don’t think I wouldn’t find out

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.880
what you’re hiding from me?

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.240
What are you talking about?

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.960
Which guy did you ditch me for, Pun?

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:39.880
Golf?

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.440
Mick?

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.680
or someone new?

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.640
I didn’t sleep with anyone. I swear.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.600
I just had to...

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.560
Had to what?

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.360
You had to what?

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.960
(knocking on door)

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.160
“Ploy.”

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.560
“Ploy, please.”

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.840
(knocking on door)

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.880
“Ploy…”

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.600
- (knocking on door)
- “Ploy, what’s going on in there?”

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.000
“At least open up for me, will you?”

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.360
“I left my lipstick inside.”

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.720
“Ploy!”

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.800
“Ploy!”

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.120
“Ugh!”

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.280
If you’ve found someone else, that’s fine.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.040
At least then I’d know
neither of us ever really meant it.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.240
That would make things easier.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.520
I don’t have anyone else.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.800
You’re the one who does.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.160
You should go.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.960
You can see I’ve got someone with me.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.600
We’re not done talking.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.280
Let me go.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120
Just leave.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.800
“Lucky me,”

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.160
“I saw your story today, Ploy.”

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.480
“Otherwise I’d have missed all the fun.”

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.160
Why is it so tense today?

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.880
Who made you so mad?

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.880
- (Next episode)
- What should I do to forget?

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.520
Getting with someone else just to forget another,

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.480
it only makes things messier or heavier.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.000
It’ll never be enough.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.960
I just want you to be clear about it.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.080
Leaving things like this only hurts both of you.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.560
It doesn’t matter anymore.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.640
All this time

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.440
was just a game to you?

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.120
In your heart,

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.880
there’s nothing left of me?

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.320
