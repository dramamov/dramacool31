[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.990
[Episode 32]

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.590
Are you Mr. Yin Yao?

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.400
That's me, Mortician Yin Yao.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.759
Nice makeup work.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.570
The details are exquisite.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.160
I must thank you

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.870
for not using cosmetics

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.400
to cover the strangulation
and finger marks

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.790
on the victim's neck.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.150
I've already examined it.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.590
You can go in and continue your work.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.510
I didn't see any coroner arrive.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.919
Officer, are you sure
no further examination is needed?

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.870
Yin Yao.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.470
You think without you,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800
Wannian County would lack good coroners?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.030
County Sheriff Su himself

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.280
is an excellent coroner.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.079
Impossible.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.150
Coroners cannot take civil service exams,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.410
so how could one become a county sheriff?

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.300
I am indeed not a coroner.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.140
I only have

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.520
a rudimentary knowledge of forensics.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
But you, sir,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.750
must be an excellent coroner.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.800
You said earlier

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.150
that the victim was strangled first

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.960
and then made to look like a suicide.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.210
Your judgment is correct.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.010
Thank you for your help.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.579
The victim's father already has

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.190
suspicions about the killer.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.400
His wife died young.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.840
He remarried last year.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.030
That woman was unfaithful.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.280
She often had affairs with others

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.750
when he was not at home.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.360
His daughter once caught her in the act.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.580
Yesterday, he found his daughter hanged.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.760
The stepmother claimed she was frightened

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760
and moved back to her mother's home.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.280
That's extremely suspicious, isn't it?

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.640
I'll go find that woman.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.280
That would be excellent.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:28.960
County Sheriff Su.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.520
Well...

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.800
Yingtao is from Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.240
It's fine to let her arrest that woman.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.710
What we fear most now is news getting out.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.360
That woman's lover

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.180
lives in this district,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.090
in the third house on the right
from the west gate.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.190
He's an alchemist.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.430
He knows some martial arts.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.360
Go question him.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.079
If no one's home,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.329
check the situation inside.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.870
If there are signs of escape,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.200
immediately make a sketch for his arrest.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.130
Understood.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.930
This case isn't actually complicated.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.350
The key lies in the coroner.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.730
You've figured that out already?

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.280
According to you,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.560
this Yin Yao...

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.720
What a ridiculous name.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.649
He is a good coroner.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.510
Then why

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.710
did he become a mortician halfway?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.450
That's a good question.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.920
Even if that

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.680
arrogant Qin Xiaobai were here,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.810
he'd have to praise his makeup skills.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.950
[Funeral]

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.560
Mr. Yin, are you free today?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.040
I'd like to invite you for a few drinks

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.000
and make your acquaintance.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.860
I'm busy today.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.780
Hey, Yin!

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.100
The esteemed County Sheriff Su,
disciple of Master Di,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.660
addressed you as 'sir'.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.780
That's a show of goodwill.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.480
How dare you be so rude?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.040
Thank you for your kindness,
County Sheriff Su.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.680
I still have
important matters to attend to.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680
I really don't have time today.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.810
Please understand.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.160
No matter.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.370
I'll invite you another day then.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.050
Satisfied now?

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.510
Look at him.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.030
Talented people

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.280
always have a bit of pride.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.750
When we were young,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.050
weren't we the same?

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.500
If you put it that way,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.320
you're really flattering him.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.000
How could he compare to us?

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.190
Let's go. Hurry up.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.390
Move.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.360
County Sheriff Su,
you're truly prescient.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.730
This guy was just about to run

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.070
when I caught him red-handed.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.270
He has confessed everything.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.480
He was having an affair
with a married woman

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.440
when the deceased caught them.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.430
Afraid of being exposed,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.470
he committed the murder.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.240
He strangled her to death before
hanging her up

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.600
to make it look like suicide.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.950
The woman has confessed too.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.070
The idea of strangling her

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.130
was actually hers.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.750
How vicious you two are!

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.130
[Geng]

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.310
[Geng Residence]

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.000
According to Captain Xu,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.250
this is where Geng Wushang lives.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.000
Knock.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.920
Is anyone home?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.310
Who are you?

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.200
Who are you people?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.800
I'm Su Wuming,
the new Wannian County Sheriff,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.830
here to visit Mr. Geng.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.710
[Geng Residence]

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.000
Oh, visitors from the county office.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.260
I'll go tell my father.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.240
Please come in.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.150
I just heard your name, esteemed guest,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.690
and you seem to be an old acquaintance.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.270
Yes, it's me, Su Wuming.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.870
Mr. Geng, how have you been?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.980
Back when you followed Master Di,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.060
[Elder Coroner of Chang'an, Geng Wushang]

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.800
you were a handsome young man.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.000
But now...

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.310
After years in officialdom,

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.760
you've returned to serve in Chang'an.

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:51.220
Congratulations.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.860
I often hear news about you,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.870
like at the Cantian Tower,

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:54.870
and Chengfo Temple.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.670
Your reputation
almost rivals your mentor's now.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.440
You flatter me, sir.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.270
I don't deserve such praise.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.180
Let me introduce them.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.270
This is my good friend,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.560
Miracle Doctor, Chicken Fei.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.720
Greetings, Coroner Geng.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.680
Well met.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.270
This young lady
works at Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.270
You can call her Yingtao.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.890
Greetings, Coroner Geng.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.270
Well met.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.870
Suchan, greet our honored guests.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.510
Greetings, Sheriff Su, Miracle Doctor Fei,

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.720
[Suchan]

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.720
and Miss Yingtao.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.390
Is this your daughter?

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.720
Yes, my daughter.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.800
Why were you wearing a mask earlier?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.260
It was quite frightening.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.630
This mask is meant to scare people.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.299
Let me explain.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.090
I've been a coroner my whole life,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.150
helping the county office

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.510
catch many killers,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.400
and made quite a few enemies.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.550
Now that I'm old,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.960
vengeful people often come to harass me.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.480
I told Suchan

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.550
to wear that mask whenever she hears

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.080
someone knocking.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.790
The timid ones will be scared away.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.780
Those harassers
might not be seeking revenge on you.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.600
They might actually be coming

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.230
for Miss Suchan.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.360
After all,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.020
she is a beautiful young lady.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.690
You're our distinguished guests,

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.320
we should invite you in for tea.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.270
But today,

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.870
we really have some business to attend to.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.150
We're going out.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.620
What business is so urgent

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.440
that you won't even
offer a drink of water?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.440
Today is my father's 70th birthday.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.790
Senior has reserved a private room

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.390
at the Dukang restaurant

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.250
to celebrate Father's birthday.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.720
May I ask for your senior's name?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.790
The one who booked the restaurant
is my eldest senior,

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.920
named Zhong Shizai.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.750
My second senior will also
be coming to pay respects,

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.810
his name is Yin Yao.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.000
I've long heard

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.330
that you have two favorite disciples.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.630
What a coincidence,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.870
we just met Yin Yao.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.450
You've met Yao?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.960
Was he

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.480
preparing a corpse?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.270
Indeed.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.000
This is my first case

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.950
since arriving in Wannian County.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.720
The family thought it was suicide,

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.510
so they didn't report it
to the authorities.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.240
Yin Yao went to prepare the body

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.750
and discovered it had been a murder.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.870
Now the killer has been caught

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.890
thanks to Yin Yao's contribution.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.520
In terms of talent,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.480
over these years,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.240
among all the coroners I've met,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.500
Yao is certainly the best.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.790
It's a pity he changed professions.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.110
If he could return to being a coroner...

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.200
My purpose in visiting

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.600
is also to find talent

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.270
for the coroner profession.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.550
If you don't mind,

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.670
could you invite us

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
to join your birthday celebration?

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.720
You won't regret inviting me.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.720
Sir,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.790
are you

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.080
suffering from a skin disease?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.550
How did you know?

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.000
Didn't you hear Su Wuming

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.200
introduce me just now?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.260
If I couldn't tell,

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.440
would I dare call myself a miracle doctor?

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.840
You invite me for a drink,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.200
and I'll treat your skin disease.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.100
How about that?

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.000
Miracle Doctor Fei,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.080
I'm afraid

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.150
you're mistaken.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.670
I'm just old,

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.630
I don't have any skin disease.

to the Dukang Restaurant.

We meet again.

In front of my mentor,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.550
you shouldn't address me like that.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.080
Master, they...

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.820
Sheriff Su is an old friend of mine.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.000
He came to visit today,

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.790
so I invited him to join our feast.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.030

to both honored guests.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.810
Respected mentor,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.490
I wish you a happy birthday.

how is your health?

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.550
Didn't you just visit

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.870
3 days ago?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.700
If you're so concerned,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.600
why not just move back in?

The deceased, Ma Kui,

was cut in the neck with a short knife.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.120
The cut was 5 fen deep.

You're all coroners?

Some are real coroners,

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.990
some barely qualify,

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.830

But we saw that the host was a general.

Anyone who dares call himself
a general in Chang'an

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.790

Coroner Dong might not have

The servant came to serve the food.

Coroner Dong
complained about the sun shining on him.

restaurant reservations for others.

they usually don't leave real names.

a suffix to the surname.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.640

All these are grape wines.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.240
Though not as authentic

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.400
as Yunding red wine,

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.800
since they can be transported to Chang'an,

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.160
they must be decent.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.700
First, they had the booking agent
reserve a private room.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.240
Then, they had to be sure

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.370
that Dong Yue would attend the banquet

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.880
and sit in that main seat.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.240
They also had to ensure

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.600
that the window
would be open at that time,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.920
and that Dong Yue
would get up to close it,

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.590
exposing his vital points completely.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.680
Most importantly,

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.240
this person must be an excellent archer.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.160
This killer is no ordinary person.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.250
Qiu, open the door!

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.610
The county office wants to question you.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:16.350
Qiu.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.270
Has anyone seen Qiu?

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.480
This guy owes me money.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.360
I've been looking for him.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.440
You're not him?

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.350
Are you human or ghost?

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.510
I could be

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.030
an ordinary person in our Tang Empire,

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.240
or a

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.680
rather pretty ghost.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.540
Which one do you prefer?

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:12.720
Young lady,

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.350
don't look for trouble.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.030
I never hit women.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.240
But you can't stop

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.270
this woman from hitting you.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.110
I...

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.030
I...

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.820
Tell the truth,

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.770
or face severe punishment.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.480
When I was serving customers that day,

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.720
I stole a bite of food.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.350
The boss caught me.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:40.960
What bad luck.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.960
Who knew when I got home...

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.070
Don't be afraid.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.160
You're Qiu,

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.200
a servant at Dukang Restaurant.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.680
Not for much longer.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.480
Because you stole

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.340
food meant for customers, right?

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:00.750
How did you know?

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.640
The day after tomorrow, at 3 pm,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.640
the Meiwu private room

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.240
will be hosting distinguished guests.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.440
Do as I say,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.720
and your boss will keep you.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.000
Don't trust me?

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.880
You must trust this, right?

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.750
I didn't want to take it,

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.030
but

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.070
it was such an easy 100 coins to earn.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.420
I just had to open the window

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.960
when I served the dishes.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.110
Nothing else?

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.240
No.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.160
How could I know
he was going to kill someone?

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.030
When I heard

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.180
someone shouting about
a dead person upstairs,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.590
I was so scared my legs went weak.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.050
So I ran away immediately.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:37.400
I'm not guilty, am I?

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.160
I did take 100 coins,

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.160
but surely I won't have to

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.290
pay with my life for that dead coroner?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.480
Because of your greed,

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.950
you were used by the killer

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.480
and led to someone's death.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.040
You...

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:48.590
I...

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.900
I know I was wrong.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.550
Please consider that I, Qiu, have been

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.920
honest and decent for years.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.200
I've never bullied the elderly or young,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.510
or women, for that matter.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:58.000
Please let me go.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.530
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.790
If you were truly remorseful,

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.640
you would have turned yourself in.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.510
Why did you run?

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.000
I...

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.550
Can't answer that, can you?

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.550
Su Wuming.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.510
This kind of person
must be taught a lesson.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.440
Otherwise, who knows what kind of trouble

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.750
he might cause in the future?

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.310
I'll never be greedy again.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.810
I accept my punishment.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.310
How about giving him 3 strokes

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.830
as punishment?

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.310
So light?

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.610
It's because we're afraid of injuring you

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.640
to the point you can't
make a living anymore.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.960
Remember this lesson.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.960
Stay away from stealing in the future.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.390
If you can't resist food,

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.510
don't work as a servant in a restaurant.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.570
Do something else.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.480
I'll remember.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.340
I'll remember.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.240
Take him away.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:43.770
Yes, sir.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:44.880
Officer.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.070
I'm Gao Wuniang.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.640
I just helped that General Lyu

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.750
book a private room.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.740
But how could I know
he was going to kill someone?

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:50.920
[Booking agent, Go Wuniang]

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.480
I'm just a booking agent.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.790
This murder has nothing to do with me.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.590
You're newly appointed.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.820
Need to host a banquet?

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:00.810
If you need to host,

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:02.590
I can make reservations for you.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.130
In all of Chang'an and Wannian,

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.600
I can book the best restaurants

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.750
in both counties.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.680
Let's first talk about

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.270
where you met

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.350
this so-called

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.680
General Lyu.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.540
At the East Market.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.480
Business is slow these days.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.750
That day, I was at the East Market,

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.030
wandering around all day

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.880
before I finally got this deal.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.920
Can you book the Dukang Restaurant

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:25.440
in Changxing district?

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:26.920
Of course.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.960
Which day would you like to book?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.150
Three days from now, at 3 pm.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.510
I want the south-facing
Meiwu private room.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.510
Is that possible?

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.440
I see you're well-informed.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.750
The best private room at Dukang Restaurant

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.880
is that one.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.590
But it's really hard to book.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.350
Once you're in line,

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.310
you'll have to wait 7 or 8 days.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.980
But I know someone,

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.970
so I can definitely get it for you.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:49.750
What's your name?

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.750
General Lyu.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.270
Tell the restaurant,

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.750
no need to wait for all guests to arrive.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.480
Serve the food promptly at 3 pm

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.900
with plenty of good wine.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:57.480
Alright.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.880
Here, take this deposit.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:31:59.960
Yingtao,

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.830
take her to Sushan Shop

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.650
and have Xijun draw a portrait.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.450
Understood.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.720
A portrait?

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.070
That sounds great!

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.750
But make sure I look beautiful in it.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.370
You're dreaming.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.160
What's the point of drawing you?

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.640
It's for that man in green robes
with the beard,

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.680
General Lyu.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.960
When the time comes,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.160
you need to describe his facial features

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:19.880
in detail.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.690
The more specific, the better.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.830
Let's go.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.640
Sir.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.270
Dong Yue never married.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.200
Besides being a coroner,

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.480
he also ran a coffin shop.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.400
This is the only assistant

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.240
of that coffin shop,

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.770
who is also his apprentice.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:39.310
Greetings, Officer.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.570
I've come to collect my master's body.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:41.740
I will use

to bury my master.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.270
Did your master know someone

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.160
called General Lyu?

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.380
No.

[Dong's Coffin Shop]

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:51.160
That day,

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.270
just as I opened the door
to our coffin shop,

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.720
I found an invitation.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.160

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.110
Perhaps someone

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.400
I met briefly?

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:10.240
Why can't I

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.840
remember this person at all?

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:12.920
Master,

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.070
if you can't remember,

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.000
then don't go.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.000
You should focus on preparing

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.460
for next month's contest.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.510
Why not go?

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.860
They have the most authentic
Dukang wine there.

Besides,

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.440
even if I'm completely drunk

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.880
on the day of the contest,

the title of Chang'an's best coroner

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.920

Master,

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.240
you said yesterday that
the top 3 in the contest

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.590
can become full-time coroners

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:38.880
and join the county office,

no longer bound
to the lowly status for generations.

Not only that.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.160

a coroner killing another coroner?

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.710
and enter the county office.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.590
Moreover,

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.110
I have a daughter.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.960
I must consider her future, too.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.480
Master.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.080
If that's the reason,

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.150
I can withdraw

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.030
from the contest.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.830
Zhong Shizai,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.800
you may go now.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.480
During the contest,

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.880
neither of us should think of
our master-apprentice relationship.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.510
Master!
