00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.830
I was alone on holidays.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.630
At school

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.830
or at home,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.200
I always felt lonely.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.600
He has everything,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.750
but he is still alone.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.810
In the end,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.780
we're the same, both lonely.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.810
Would you like

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.090
a warm drink?

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.570
Can't believe

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.190
it's a one-month contract.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.500
They were usually just

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.900
one-night stands,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.990
relationships

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.520
that disintegrate by dawn.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.460
But you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.560
actually

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.620
gave this a month.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.370
You were serious

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.690
and sincere.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.850
I could tell by your eyes.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.620
It's an earnestness

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.750
I don't understand.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.090
I should've refused you.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.060
That's my usual style.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.550
But I don't know why

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.539
I felt drawn

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.650
to the "one month."

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.660
Yeah.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.290
Mom.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.530
It's me.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.740
Got it.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.430
I've found the best doctor too.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.870
Don't worry about money.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.230
I've also

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.110
taken care of my tuition.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.890
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.390
Okay.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.660
Bye.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.900
I love you.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.330
He didn't meet anyone today, did he?

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.110
Good.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.120
Keep monitoring him.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.060
So I see your spy's just

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.210
reported my whereabouts to you.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.290
Before that,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.660
have a look at this.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.770
It's a new contract

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.690
for another month.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.110
I've adjusted the terms.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.910
Jaehun-hyung,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.700
just one more month.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.470
It'll only

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.220
cost you 10,000 dollars.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.410
I'll do anything you want.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.420
Anything.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.990
Jaehun-hyung!

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.790
I'm here.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.480
You only have wine and salad every day.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.990
Eat something regular at times.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.050
What kind of service do you want tonight?

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.810
Haejun is always smiling.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.320
His smile is so bright that

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.060
this thing we have almost feels real.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.880
But I found out by chance today

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.310
that beneath his smile

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.440
is a heavy heart.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.850
He shoulders so much alone,

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.180
yet he always
greets me with a warm smile.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.090
When I knew of his troubled soul,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.220
I began to feel for him a little.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.940
Now,

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.900
I want to protect his smile.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.630
Even just a little,

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.460
I'll be more gentle.
