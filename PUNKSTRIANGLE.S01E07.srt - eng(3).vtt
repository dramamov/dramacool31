00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:08.375
Do you... like me in that way?

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:12.458
AE...

00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:16.083
It's okay. You're cute.

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958
Is something wrong with me?

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:56.333
It's gonna hurt.

00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:13.708
"PUNKS△TRIANGLE"
(Episode 7)

00:03:10.417 --> 00:03:11.500
- Hasegawa.
- Yes?

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.042
Did you reply to that inquiry?

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:14.833
It's been handled.

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.125
- Thank you.
- Of course.

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.458
Sumiura.

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:23.958
That competition is tomorrow, right?

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:26.833
Yes.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:28.875
What's that?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.640
It's a collab competition with
"SHOWNAVI."

00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:32.958
It's getting a lot of buzz in the industry.

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:33.958
I heard that if you win,

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:37.750
AE will wear your outfit on the runway.

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:40.917
AE?! That's amazing!

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:45.375
Getting AE to wear your design
would be a dream come true.

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:47.208
Welcome.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.750
Welcome.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.750
Today's the last day to
prepare for the competition.

00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:59.750
Even if I make it big in the future...

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:04.875
and meet AE as a "designer and model"...

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:10.958
we can never go back
to the way things were.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:17.542
But why, back then...

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:22.292
The look on his face...

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:27.875
My head is a total mess.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.583
Heading to school after this?

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:43.000
Yeah, the competition's tomorrow.
I have to do some final checks.

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.375
I see.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.167
You've done a great job
considering how little time you had.

00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:49.667
So, who's going to wear the outfit?

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:52.625
Don't tell me it's you, AE?

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.042
No way. That would totally blow my cover.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:59.917
True. Is it a student from
the modeling department?

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.167
It's my partner for the project.

00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:07.708
A partner, huh?

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:15.000
Oh, so that's what this is all about.

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:16.250
Huh?

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:17.375
It's him, isn't it?

00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:21.167
The one who's making you so
clumsy when it comes to love.

00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:26.167
I knew it.

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:29.667
But hey, this is the perfect excuse for you
two to present something together, right?

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:37.125
I don't know what happened, but good luck.

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:41.583
That's true.

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:47.583
(P Mode Fashion Academy)

00:05:56.458 --> 00:05:59.167
Suzuki, you've got way
too many loose threads here.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:03.042
Whoa! Good catch.
You're a lifesaver, Mochizuki.

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:04.292
Honestly...

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:06.708
Um, Shino-san, the pleats
here are coming loose.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:10.333
I'll take care of this. Can
you handle the lining?

00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:13.417
This hem should probably be secured better.

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:14.667
In that case...

00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:18.250
By the time you're done, Enaga, the
contest will have started. Give it to me.

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:41.958
Ow.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.833
This isn't like you, Sumiura.

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:48.167
Give me your hand.

00:06:48.292 --> 00:06:49.542
Huh?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.958
Hey, Enaga, this is...

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:58.125
I took a page out of your book
and started carrying them on me.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.708
It took me forever to find the same one.

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:12.667
A matching pair.

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:23.167
Sumiura...

00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:27.250
Alright, is everyone ready?

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:31.250
Tomorrow's dress rehearsal starts at 10 AM.

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:34.167
The main event starts at 2 PM.

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:35.583
Don't be late.

00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:36.917
Okay...

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.542
Somehow, I can't bring myself
to look Enaga in the eye...

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:57.458
Sumiura can't focus.

00:07:57.583 --> 00:08:02.958
It must be... my fault.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.333
Good work.

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:07.458
You too.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.042
See you tomorrow.

00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:17.833
Let's do our best tomorrow.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.583
Yeah... See you tomorrow.

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:35.167
Chiaki, you were working so hard
to make your dream come true...

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.750
I'm only telling you this
because we're close.

00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:41.458
My dream...

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:45.625
is to have AE walk the runway
in an outfit I made.

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:53.375
But... whether that
dream comes true or not,

00:08:53.792 --> 00:08:57.833
once you find out that I'm AE...

00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:31.167
This is... the place I first
started going out at night.

00:09:34.042 --> 00:09:40.000
It's also where I first met AE.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.667
That night, everything seemed to sparkle.

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:58.417
The night air smelled... new and different.

00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:02.500
You've become quite the bad boy, Chiaki.

00:10:05.542 --> 00:10:07.500
Everything was so fresh and new...

00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:14.417
But now...

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:17.417
I don't even understand
my own feelings anymore.

00:10:19.083 --> 00:10:21.083
I'm sorry about the last time.

00:10:21.542 --> 00:10:23.583
I ruined my bias's clothes.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.333
I went to a hotel with my bias...

00:10:29.542 --> 00:10:31.917
I even had my bias give me a piercing...

00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:47.542
Is something wrong with me?

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:49.583
Of course not.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:52.250
How could there be anything wrong with
you...

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.417
Why?

00:10:57.917 --> 00:11:00.083
Enaga, you're covered in paint.

00:11:00.208 --> 00:11:02.583
So are you, Sumiura.

00:11:04.583 --> 00:11:05.833
Why?

00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.792
Even though it's the color of poop.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.000
Don't say that out loud!

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:09.833
This is fun.

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.208
This isn't fun at all!

00:11:13.583 --> 00:11:15.000
Why?

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:17.917
I'm Enaga Ayumu. It's nice to meet you.

00:11:18.042 --> 00:11:19.583
Enaga, do you have a bias?

00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:20.958
Maybe... I guess?

00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:22.833
I'm not telling you to give up on punk.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:23.483
Not bad.

00:11:23.508 --> 00:11:24.667
Is it matte and sparkly?

00:11:24.792 --> 00:11:26.042
Huh? I forgot.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.410
Let me rest on your shoulder.

00:11:27.458 --> 00:11:29.143
The beans keep running away
from me, so I'm chasing them.

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:32.000
Let's do our best in the competition.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.042
Why? Again...

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:46.708
My mind is filled with thoughts of Enaga.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.250
In the end, I couldn't sleep at all.

00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:17.333
And just like that, the morning
of the competition arrived...

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:25.375
(P Mode Fashion Academy)

00:12:31.875 --> 00:12:34.000
Ooh, nice.

00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:37.583
I'm so glad I got paired
with you, Shino-san.

00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:42.417
But everyone's work is so high-level.
Do you think we can win?

00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:44.375
We've done all we can do.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.792
Their outfit looks
particularly amazing, though.

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:49.042
You're right.

00:12:49.417 --> 00:12:52.125
I saw them staying late pretty often.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.958
Either way, they've
become a pretty good team.

00:12:57.458 --> 00:12:59.380
It really suits you...

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.875
You look great, Sumiura.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.833
Th... thanks.

00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:12.375
Alright, rehearsal is starting.

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:16.000
Good luck with the rehearsal.

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:19.625
Yeah... thanks.

00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.208
I'm heading out.

00:13:31.917 --> 00:13:33.351
"P-MODE Collection 2025
SHOW NAVI Presents: Human Connection"

00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:35.958
Okay, let's begin the rehearsal.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.667
Is everyone ready?

00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:40.042
Yes...

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:43.250
A lot of people will be
watching the actual show.

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.833
Let's put on a show
that everyone will enjoy.

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.042
Yes...

00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:49.292
Alright, cue the music.

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:59.250
My head's still a mess.

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:02.708
This is no good.

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:06.875
I need to focus on the
competition right in front of me.

00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:12.458
Focus...

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.083
Number 1, you're up.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.250
Right.

00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:30.625
Chiaki!

00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:35.583
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.458
It hurts...

00:14:40.417 --> 00:14:41.833
Ah...

00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:46.167
The outfit...

00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:52.708
It's ripped! It's ripped! What do we do?

00:14:52.833 --> 00:14:54.833
Sumiura, calm down.

00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.458
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:58.625
What are we going to do?

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.042
How is he?

00:15:11.167 --> 00:15:14.333
It looks like a sprain, but just in case,
please go to the hospital afterwards.

00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:17.042
Got it. You okay?

00:15:17.426 --> 00:15:18.426
Yeah.

00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.458
Sorry.

00:15:21.708 --> 00:15:25.042
This means you can't walk
in the show today.

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:28.292
No! I'm going to walk.

00:15:28.417 --> 00:15:29.125
But Sumiura...

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.167
No, I won't let you.

00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:34.833
Then what about the competition?

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:40.792
What's going to happen
to the outfit we made?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.792
I'll walk.

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:51.292
What... What are you talking about?

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.917
Enaga, you and I are
completely different heights.

00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:00.083
See?

00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:05.208
Either way, I'm walking.
We need to fix this rip, fast.

00:16:10.583 --> 00:16:12.083
Enaga, what are you doing...?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.167
Everyone, does anyone have safety pins?

00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:27.458
Any kind will do!
Can I borrow as many as you have?

00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:47.250
Sumiura, our outfit is punk-style, right?

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:51.917
We'll use safety pins to adjust the length.

00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:56.042
That's right. Your clothes are punk.

00:16:59.792 --> 00:17:01.625
Here, use these.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.458
I only have a few, but here.

00:17:03.583 --> 00:17:04.250
Thanks.

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:05.667
I've got some big ones! Here.

00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:07.583
- You can have this too.
- Thank you.

00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:15.042
Who'd want to deal with you guys?

00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:19.917
You're all my competition.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.458
Everyone...

00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:30.875
Thank you.

00:17:32.375 --> 00:17:34.333
Don't mention it.

00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958
Yeah. We're supposed to help
each other out when things get tough.

00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:40.375
We're classmates, after all.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.292
If that's not enough,

00:17:50.417 --> 00:17:52.833
I can go check the other classrooms.

00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.292
Please.

00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:55.708
Thank you.

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:56.917
Yeah.

00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:58.792
Alright.

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:09.208
Enaga, rip the top
too. I'll take care of it.

00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:12.583
Let's re-tailor this to fit your size.

00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:46.250
Everyone, the doors are opening!

00:18:48.208 --> 00:18:51.333
Okay... It's finally coming together.

00:18:52.917 --> 00:18:56.208
I'll handle your hair and makeup.
Let's get you ready over there.

00:18:56.333 --> 00:18:59.042
Thank you. I'm in your hands.

00:18:59.167 --> 00:19:00.375
Go on, Enaga Ayumu.

00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:03.000
Sumiura...

00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:04.208
I'm sorry.

00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:11.667
Wha... What for?

00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:13.750
For your terrible runway walk?

00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:20.792
"P-MODE Collection 2025
SHOW NAVI Presents: Human Connection"

00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:25.583
This is the runway.

00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:26.748
The elevator is over here.

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:37.292
This is the runway.

00:19:37.417 --> 00:19:40.917
The elevator is right ahead.
Please watch your step.

00:19:41.208 --> 00:19:44.333
Welcome to the P-mode Collection 2025.

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:49.958
The elevator is right ahead.

00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:54.417
Okay, let's take your hat off first.

00:20:07.583 --> 00:20:10.375
Enaga, your hair...

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:18.917
Could you try to keep
my face from being seen?

00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:22.042
I don't want the audience to recognize me.

00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:27.958
OK.

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:39.958
And now, it's time for SHOW NAVI's
'Fashion Show of Human Connection'!

00:20:44.583 --> 00:20:48.333
The winner will be decided
by a vote from our guests.

00:20:48.458 --> 00:20:51.018
The winner will get to collaborate
with a professional designer.

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:55.667
And their creation will be worn
by top model AE at the TBC.

00:20:56.833 --> 00:21:01.958
And now, please enjoy these pieces which
our students poured their souls into.

00:21:27.042 --> 00:21:28.125
Here he is!

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.792
I've seen that walk countless
times. There's no mistake.

00:23:06.333 --> 00:23:07.875
Enaga Ayumu is...

00:23:16.125 --> 00:23:17.542
AE.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.309
(Next Episode) You don't
even want to look at my face?

00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:00.292
But I still want Chiaki.

00:24:00.417 --> 00:24:02.333
Don't mess with those feelings.

00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:05.458
Didn't you find your own courage
through punk fashion?

00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:06.601
We're partners, aren't we?

00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:08.601
You're the first person
I've ever truly opened up to.

00:24:08.625 --> 00:24:10.375
My heart already belongs to someone else.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.458
No one's ever taught me how to kiss.

00:24:12.583 --> 00:24:13.958
Let me teach you.
