00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.600
Stop right there!

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.000
Why are you running?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.840
Running under the sunset like this

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.760
feels like our lost youth.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.240
I used to be too slow to catch you.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.760
Now I finally manage to catch up.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.000
Tell me, why are you running?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.200
I'm so foolish too.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.960
How could he know, fifteen years later,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.800
why he needed to run?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.160
Darn it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.920
I forgot.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.080
I'm fifteen years younger.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.160
He's fifteen years younger too.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.240
I should look for Su Ruo now.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.880
Where would Su Ruo be now?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.480
My condolences.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.200
Yu Xingchen, why are you here?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.080
Go on inside.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.200
Everyone is waiting for you.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.840
I don't want to go in.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.720
I feel like once I go in,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.760
I'll truly have to say goodbye.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.280
I don't know what to do

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440
once I'm inside.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.920
After you go in,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.880
they play mourning music for three minutes.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.920
Then the family gives a speech.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.920
Are you giving the speech?

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.760
No.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.560
It's my uncle.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.080
Next, three bows.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.840
Then we circle the body to say goodbye.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.600
If you want to cry,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.520
do it at that moment.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.400
But I don't want to cry.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.760
Then don't cry.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.680
After that, the body is taken for cremation.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.640
You're a direct relative,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.360
so you have to sign.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.400
Just follow the procedure.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.120
It's not complicated.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.560
Yu Xingchen, can you go in with me?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.600
It's not really appropriate for me to go in.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.280
I know.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.600
I shouldn't ask for this.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.960
Sorry.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.760
But I'll wait for you here.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.200
Go on.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.160
Your parents brought you into this world.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.200
They'd want you to see them off.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.920
Don't worry.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.760
I'm not going anywhere.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.480
I'll wait for you right here.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.880
Next,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.120
let us express

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.280
our deep condolences for Ms. Su Ruo.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.560
We will play mourning music for three minutes.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.760
Decided to attend the memorial.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.840
Don't go.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.240
Fell from a great height.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.720
She looked a bit tragic.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.600
Even with makeup, she couldn't be seen.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.880
Better to keep a good memory.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.880
Just said goodbye to you,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.240
and now I see you again.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960
That's nice.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.080
It's over.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.800
The urn will be kept here for now.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.440
The cemetery is crowded.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.440
It'll be a few days before burial.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.000
Yu Xingchen.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.040
How do you know the process so well?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.640
Because not long ago,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.200
I just said goodbye to

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.320
someone very important to me.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.480
Yu Xingchen.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.800
I didn't cry.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.720
I want my parents to see me strong.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.600
They'll surely be proud of you.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.200
You said you don't want to say goodbye.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.240
But growing up means slowly

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.240
saying goodbye to what you once had.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.360
Like some things, some people,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.880
you thought you'd never lose.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.920
So often,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.080
we have to learn to face it alone.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.280
I've heard so many comforting words lately.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.920
But what you said is different.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.920
Yu Xingchen.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.640
Thank you.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.520
Mr. Yu.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.080
Where's your son?

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.280
Isn't he coming to see his mother off?

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.720
He's hiding outside.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.600
No matter how we call, he won't come in.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.600
Alright.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.640
Don't be mad.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.000
That rascal.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.000
Son.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.960
Are you under too much stress lately?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.240
If you feel bothered,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.800
I'll step out first.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.240
Remember to eat the fruit.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.520
This...

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.640
Mom.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.440
Mom.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.920
Xiao Ai Tongxue.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.960
Turn off the alarm.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.080
Yu Xingchen, stop lazing in bed.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.200
Time for school.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.800
Dad, why are you here again?

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.600
It's Saturday, no work today.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.640
You...

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.800
Does senior year have Saturdays off?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.320
Still dreaming of weekends off.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.680
Are you out of it?

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:46.840
Get up.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.280
Based on last time, I should've gone back already.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.840
I get it now.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.920
According to the quantum fluctuation effect,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.320
each universe has different space-time curvature.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.040
Like rivers with different flow speeds.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.000
So the timing is random each time.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.000
Can't find the person in the footage.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.680
Can't catch him at his house either.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.360
No, I can't waste this chance.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.360
I must get to the bottom of this.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.800
Find out who that person in the footage is.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.560
What are you muttering about?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.720
Standing at the school gate, not going in.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.080
Yu Xingchen.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.200
Cheer up, it's senior year.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.600
Morning! You look lively today.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.800
Did you do your homework last night?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.960
I worked on mine until midnight.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.120
Homework...

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.440
How did I forget about that?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.400
What's going on?

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.880
Each lap is slower than the last.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:13.960
Didn't you eat enough?

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.920
I didn't eat at all.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.840
Back then, Dad was just one step

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.840
away from the national team.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.960
Dad summed it up—

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.560
the reason he didn't succeed all these years

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.960
was missing someone

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.920
who could always push you forward.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.840
But lucky for you,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.360
you have a father like me now.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.960
Can I take a break?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.840
You can.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.960
But

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.240
on the track,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.240
your rivals won't let you rest.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.200
I'm heading to the broadcast station.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.280
Listen to what Dad says—

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.440
right now,

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.480
put all your youthful energy

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.520
into running on the track.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.800
Youth means always moving forward,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.720
never stopping.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.680
Good morning, everyone.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.160
I'm your host, Su Ruo.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.640
It's time for this episode of Vibrant Campus.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.160
After some relaxing music,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.240
let's see

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.280
the first blessing for today.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.520
It's from a rather shy student.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.840
He wants to dedicate a song to Lu Xiaoxiao
from Class 8, Grade 11.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.480
Wishing her great results in the city essay contest.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.160
Zhang Xun.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.720
You really need to be careful
with that move next time.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.120
It's easy to get a concussion.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.000
You know that, right?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.840
Got any extra bread to share?

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.680
I've got extra test papers—want some?

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.880
I promise you'll lose your appetite
after seeing them.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.760
I didn't eat anything this morning.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.360
Ran three thousand meters with speed changes.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.840
Our path is even narrower than the college entrance exam.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.080
So many go to college every year,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.960
but how many actually make it to the podium?

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.000
I really don't know if I can get results.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.840
Yu Xingchen.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.600
Tell me, can I make the provincial team

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.280
and stand on the podium?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.240
In the future, it seems

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.120
I don't recall you ever winning glory for the country.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.160
What do you mean?

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.280
I don't have homework for you to copy.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.360
Even if I did, I wouldn't copy yours.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.800
You're still young and growing.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.000
You can't skip breakfast.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.880
You're younger than me.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.200
Are you eating or not?

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.560
I'm off to copy homework.

Hui Ge, do you have a moment?

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:51.800
I do.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.320
But my time is pretty valuable.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.680
According to Newton's Third Law,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.480
the net force on the block from the wedge
is vertically downward.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.920
So the wedge's effect

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.760
doesn't make it move along the ground.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.120
It doesn't get friction from the ground.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:11.880
Choose A.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.640
Thanks.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.320
I really don't get physics.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.440
For classical physics, just master those formulas

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.320
and you'll handle almost anything.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.280
Most people

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.440
won't run into

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.720
situations where classical physics fails.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.680
Fails.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.200
I really don't understand.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.120
For example,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.600
at extremely large or tiny scales,

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.960
classical physics doesn't apply.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.160
Just like time—

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.520
it can even stop or go backward.
