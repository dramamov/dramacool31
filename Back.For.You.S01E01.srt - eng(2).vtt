Help!

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.760
Su Ruo

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.760
The body was only found at six
this morning.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.800
This is an old neighborhood.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.880
There aren't many cameras outside.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.440
Every time you travel back in time,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.680
the world you were in before

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.480
becomes

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.520
a parallel world you abandoned.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.640
Su Ruo

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.840
Stay alive.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.960
Sir,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.240
you requested Chinese therapeutic massage.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.840
It helps with circulation
and relieves fatigue.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.360
You can close your eyes.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.520
My name is Yu Xingchen.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.800
I'm just an ordinary researcher.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.080
After revising papers for three days straight,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520
I can finally relax for a bit.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.280
Weihaoke's "That Year"

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.360
really captured the voice of youth.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.200
I wonder if you ever sometimes

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.200
think of that person you liked.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.800
Sorry, are you hurt?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.760
I was grading students' papers recently,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.880
stayed up several nights.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.760
That's really bad for your health.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.920
Like when you saved up a week's homework,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.640
and tried to finish it all overnight.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.680
Who could handle that?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.360
We had a classmate like that too.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.400
He never did homework at night,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.920
and copied it before morning class.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.760
I was like that too.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.920
What was that classmate's name?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.160
I think it was

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.280
Yu Xingchen.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240
Su Ruo

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.320
Yu Xingchen,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.320
long time no see.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Her name is Su Ruo.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.960
She was my classmate in high school.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.560
She was outstanding in both character
and academics.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.600
Talented and beautiful.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.840
She was the girl I never dared to pursue.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.680
Su Ruo

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.480
All these years,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.160
you've been working here?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.440
Yeah.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.400
It's been many years.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.200
Must be tough.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.360
Everything's tough these days.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.520
By the way, Yu Xingchen,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.840
do you still like me?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.480
Just asking casually.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.720
Why are you so nervous?

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.720
My time's up.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.360
I can extend the session.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.520
No need.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.200
You can sleep a bit more.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.320
You can close your eyes.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.160
Close them.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.760
Thanks for your hard work.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.960
I'm heading out.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.200
Could you please

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.480
give this umbrella

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.200
to the guest in room 227?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.760
Sure.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.200
Sir,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.120
Therapist No. 12 asked me to tell you

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.440
she left after her shift.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.040
Sir, here you go.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.280
Thank you.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.200
Confession.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.720
One year after school, with everyone
egging me on,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.920
I planned to confess to her.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.000
Confession.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.760
But I lowered my head in front of her,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.600
stammered for five minutes
without getting to the point.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.320
Confession.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.080
Until more and more people gathered around.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.960
Do you have something to say to me?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.040
There's no one here now.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240
You can say it.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.080
I...

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.080
I want to tell you...

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.160
Are you trying to say you like me?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.200
Okay, I get it.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.880
You're a guy,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.760
if you like someone in the future,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.360
just say it.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.160
I'll go now.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.640
To her,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.920
I was just one of many boys
who liked her.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.880
Her "I get it"

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.960
was a polite and friendly rejection.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.120
So after graduation,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.280
my timid self never contacted her again.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.400
Who would've thought, after fifteen years,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.000
we'd meet again like this.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.920
By the way, Yu Xingchen,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.920
do you still like me?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.720
I do.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.320
Yes, I do.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.560
Of course I do.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.280
I do.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.040
It's me.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.400
I had a meeting last night,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.680
so I missed your call.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.560
Is something up?

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.640
I went to bed early yesterday.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.520
I saw your call and called you back.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.360
Hello, the number you dialed
is powered off.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.240
Old classmate,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.080
you're here so early to see me.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.120
Do you remember?

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.920
The deceased was our high school classmate.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.640
The one you've never forgotten.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.760
Su Ruo.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.040
Her body was only found at six this morning.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.680
Cause of death: falling from a building.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.920
Yu Xingchen, long time no see.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.920
You...

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.760
were her last client.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.240
No one saw her after she left work yesterday.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.440
You've been working here all these years.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.480
It's been quite a few years.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.360
Must be tough, right?

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.920
Everything's tough nowadays.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.800
Let me treat you to a late-night snack.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.560
Maybe another day.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.000
I'll ask you out next time.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.800
The surveillance matches what he said.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.880
No obvious signs of struggle or injury.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.120
Her belongings and wallet weren't missing.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.440
Forensics Division found this at her place.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.160
Did you give this to her?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.400
Is this letter from you?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.280
We hadn't met for fifteen years before last night.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.840
You used cut-out letters to hide your handwriting.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.960
It wasn't me.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.520
Check the fingerprints if you don't believe me.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.200
This letter was written with gloves on.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.240
No fingerprints could be found on the letter.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.560
It really wasn't me.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.720
If you don't believe me, lock me up and interrogate me.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.800
I don't even know her address.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.560
How could I mail her this letter?

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.920
We believe it was just an accident.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.240
But as police officers,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.600
it's our duty to ask you for clarification.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.680
After all, you were the last person she saw.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.560
She...

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.920
How did she really die?

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.320
We're still investigating.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.600
I want to see where it happened.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.680
Bro, I understand you.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.960
It's hard when an old classmate has an accident.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.000
I was the one who reported it.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.800
I also led the police into the apartment.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.400
If you have questions, just ask me.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.080
Did the deceased live in this building?

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.200
No, she lived in the building opposite.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.480
This is an old neighborhood.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.880
There aren't many cameras outside.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.600
Only the area downstairs has surveillance.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.760
Were you on duty the day it happened?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920
No, it was another guy.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.160
I heard that on the day of the incident,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.520
the rooftop door was locked from inside.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.560
The girl probably locked it herself.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.200
She fell from right here.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.240
You shouldn't stay here too long.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.280
I'm heading down now.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.920
Just yesterday,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.480
Su Ruo gently

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.800
said so many things to me.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.400
In just half a day,

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.200
she's gone somewhere I can't reach.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.920
Was she ever afraid?

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.840
When she called me,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.480
what was she thinking?

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.240
Everyone says you like me.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.680
By the way, Yu Xingchen,

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.040
do you still like me?

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.160
Do you still like me?

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.680
I do.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.720
At first,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.000
I thought this was just a dream.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.040
I'm dreaming.
