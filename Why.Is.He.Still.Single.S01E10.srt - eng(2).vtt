"Little Women" is such

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.390
a good film.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.300
I read the novel,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.860
but I didn't really get it.

00:03:18.884 --> 00:03:20.420
Now that I've experienced more of life,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.860
I realize how brave the heroine is.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.300
Here's to being brave.

00:03:26.662 --> 00:03:28.550
Why hasn't "Little Women"
been returned yet?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.706
I've been waiting forever.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.670
Don't know.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.950
Check who rented it.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.990
What gives?

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.230
Why should I tell you?

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.950
I'm a professional.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.070
I have to protect my clients' privacy.

00:03:39.528 --> 00:03:40.580
If you're that desperate,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.790
watch it online.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.790
Just be patient.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.790
Why should I?

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.510
Didn't you say there was a new set?

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:47.580
I'll buy that one instead.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.550
Oh, right.

00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:52.660
Didn't you say
I gave you a terrible deal?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.020
So I sold it to someone else.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.550
You're the worst.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.950
Jia.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.270
How'd you feel about the film?

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.510
A great movie is like a mirror.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.270
It makes you look at your own life

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.740
through someone else's story.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.670
That's quite a clever line.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.790
But I don't want to give up marriage
just to chase freedom.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.260
I want both.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.470
I've always wanted a relationship

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.620
and a big family.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.750
Do you think

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.260
that makes me shallow?

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.500
Not at all.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.740
Wanting love and company

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.990
isn't shallow.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.180
Besides,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.500
what matters is you know what you want.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.940
That already
puts you ahead of most people.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.820
Xiaoman,
you should have more confidence.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.430
Okay.

00:04:55.106 --> 00:04:57.060
So, what kind of person
are you looking for?

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.910
I've talked about this with my dad.

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:03.795
There are three things that matter most.

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.910
First, someone you don't
get tired of looking at.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.500
Second, someone fun.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.110
Third,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.820
someone you can talk to.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.940
If they're easy on the eyes,
that means they're handsome.

00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:19.700
If you can talk to them, that means
they're emotionally intelligent.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.380
My ex was great at talking,

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.084
but later I found out
he talked like that to every girl.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.230
Being fun is the hardest to define.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.620
Who even counts as fun?

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.110
Mr. Yu's fun, isn't he?

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.500
What's wrong?

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.620
The movie was so good.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.030
I want to watch it again and again.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.173
I'm not returning this disc.

00:05:49.173 --> 00:05:50.230
They can keep the deposit.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.580
- All right.
- Here.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.350
Cheers!

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.060
(To those)

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.590
(who don't understand racing,)

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.030
(it's just cars going in circles).

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.060
(But the ones who get it,
know the charm of it.)

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.420
(It's the never-ending
pursuit of speed.)

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.430
(The thrill of acceleration,
flirting with danger.)

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.470
(It inflates your confidence.)

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.550
(It gives you the rush
of controlling roaring power)

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.790
(and complicated machinery.)

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.910
(It's a peak celebration
of technology and courage.)

00:07:08.484 --> 00:07:11.050
(Speed and passion)
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.470
the final's about to begin.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.860
Who will take home the title?

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.860
Let's find out.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.590
Starting positions in the final

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.910
are determined by the qualifying scores.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.180
First on the grid is Bu Jingyun.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.910
His car looks ready
to blast off the starting line.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.110
Second is Nie Feng,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.820
driving the "Very Invincible."

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.110
Third is our lovely racer,

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.260
Zhang Liheng.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.710
Fourth is Yu Yu.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.940
He and his
"Who Borrowed The Little Woman?"

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.180
are heading for the trophy.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.230
Ready!

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.540
(4 Yu Yu)
Go!

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.150
Look at that!

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.860
Yu Yu nailed the start

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.300
and jumped straight into third.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.500
He tries an outside overtake.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.710
Nie Feng holds his line tight.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.820
The finalists' lap times

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.180
(Yu Yu, Third Place)
are incredibly fast.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.180
All three broke the ten-second mark,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.590
hitting speeds
over 100 kilometers per hour.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.030
Yu Yu slipped in the corner,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.940
but he corrected his line right away.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.350
Nie Feng tries to pass.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.740
His fight with Bu Jingyun is intense.

00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:23.540
(Bu Jingyun, Nie Feng,
Zhang Liheng, Yu Yu)

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.500
Every driver is locked in.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.540
At these speeds,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.470
one slip

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.990
and you're done.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.020
Yu Yu takes a braver line
into the corner.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.900
Astonishing!

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.950
Yu Yu uses two back-to-back curves

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.540
to jump straight into first.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.140
He skims
the edge of the track to pass them.

00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:50.950
Bu Jingyun refuses to back down

00:08:50.951 --> 00:08:52.130
and tries to reclaim the lead,

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.380
but Yu Yu's line

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.740
is flawless.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.990
This time, Nie Feng tries.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.140
He's glued
to "Who Borrowed The Little Woman?"

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.990
Yu Yu doesn't let him get through.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.640
(Yu Yu, First Place)
Two corners left. Who'll take it?

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.990
Straightaway! Speed up! Go!

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.350
Yu Yu crosses the finish line first!

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.540
We have our champion!

00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:31.580
(Yu Yu, First Place)

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.140
Remote model car racing champion.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.190
Yeah, I won. Impressive, right?

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.070
You learned to drive?

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.500
No.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.340
This.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.020
A toy car?

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.780
Wu.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.620
Come here.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.430
Allow me to introduce you.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.140
Don't underestimate this thing.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.190
Its top speed

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.860
hits more than 100 kilometers per hour.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.950
I modified it in several places.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.740
Lower drag,

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.990
better handling,

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.540
lighter body,

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.740
and its exhaust...

00:10:13.217 --> 00:10:15.790
Sharing something you love
with someone who doesn't appreciate it

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.260
really is a lonely kind of humiliation.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.710
The client has new requests again.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.020
She wants a welcome camera
at the entrance.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.380
So when her husband gets home,

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.110
it'll make a beep

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.990
and she can greet him at the door.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.900
Which country is this woman from?

00:10:33.728 --> 00:10:35.430
Who still greets
their husband like that?

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.500
Sounds like its real use is to warn

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.470
her lover

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.350
to hide.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.020
Just do what she wants.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:43.900
Yeah.

00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:46.500
Besides, having someone greet you
when you get home sounds nice.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.817
Mr. Yu, when you come home from work

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.900
and step into a dark place,

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.260
don't you feel lonely?

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.380
Of course.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.220
Yeah.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.110
Why would I be?

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.310
I've got this one with me,

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.830
and this one,

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.500
and plenty more of these with me.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.860
Shameless.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.700
You're hopeless.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.540
Good evening.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.140
Buying dog food?

00:11:30.573 --> 00:11:31.740
Why not get it delivered?

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.590
Delivery fees are ridiculous.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.950
The food itself is already expensive.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.740
I'm practically broke.

00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:40.110
You might as well have a baby.

00:11:40.373 --> 00:11:42.617
At least kids can pay you back
when they grow up.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.710
Meanwhile,

00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:45.573
your dog will only spend your money.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.710
My dog's my family.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.950
It's the way Dao waits at home

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.990
for me to come back...

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.550
Mr. Yu, you wouldn't understand.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.830
Waiting for their owner to return

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.900
and feed them
is a basic mammal instinct, you know?

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.230
Good night.

00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:31.710
Why's the elevator broken again?

00:12:31.795 --> 00:12:33.140
I'm definitely filing a complaint.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.830
Good thing you're here, Mr. Yu. Thanks.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.660
I should've minded my own business.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.740
What's inside this thing?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.350
Don't shake it.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.310
This is much better than your dog.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.070
Doesn't need food, won't pee everywhere,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.500
and it runs fast.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.110
I can't guess.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.140
What is it?

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.780
I'll bet you can't.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:55.790
Bye.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.470
It's only two more steps.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.710
You should see it through.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:04.310
Please open the door.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.990
Dao!

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.500
Missed me?

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.340
Come here.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.660
I bought you lots of treats.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.660
Hey, quiet down!

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.830
Mr. Yu,

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.540
when you get home...

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.380
And hear that little beep.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.190
Isn't it nice to have
someone waiting for you?

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.900
(My... my stomach...)

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.990
(Why does it suddenly hurt this much?)

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.830
(It hurts so much I can't speak.)

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.150
(I'm dying.)

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.900
(Mr. Yu, help me!)

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.190
It hurts!

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.190
What... what are you doing?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.928
What's wrong with you?

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.950
It hurts...

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:19.620
Did you eat dog food?

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.500
You've got appendicitis.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.620
It's not that serious though.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.900
A minimally invasive surgery,

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.310
and you should be able
to eat normally in a day or two.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.590
What about my hand?

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.830
Well, I looked at your report.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.151
It's probably a minor fracture.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.350
But I'll have
an orthopedic doctor take a look.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.700
Okay.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.110
Mr. Yu is brutal.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.740
From what I can remember,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.780
he crushed it twice with his heel

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.260
like he was putting out a cigarette.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.500
He's unbelievable.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.740
It's Qing. I'll put her on speaker.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.340
Hello?

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.350
Xiaoman.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.190
Are you feeling any better?

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.050
I'll take leave this afternoon
and visit you.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.310
I'm fine.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.150
Um,

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.070
can you check on Dao for me?

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.230
I'm really worried about it.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.020
Sure, I can do that.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.590
And I might need to stay
in the hospital for a week.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.540
Can you take care of it for a few days?

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.780
That's not possible.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.540
My landlord won't allow it.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.310
And my roommate, you know her.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.751
She definitely won't allow it.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.310
Okay, I'll think of something.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:32.900
Get some rest.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.380
Why're you staring at me?

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.070
I work night shifts every day.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.595
I don't have time to look after Dao.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.020
I know.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.590
Being a doctor is tough.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.710
Xiaoman, how are you?

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.140
I heard Mr. Yu crushed your hand.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.470
Don't exaggerate.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.110
It's not crushed, just fractured.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.430
It must hurt a lot.

00:16:00.995 --> 00:16:03.470
Mr. Yu made ribs for you
so you can get more calcium.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.350
I'm having surgery.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.860
I can't eat anything.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:07.910
So what now?

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.470
Have you eaten, Dr. Gu?

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:11.710
No.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.140
Then why don't we eat it?

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.484
Seems a waste to throw it away.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.860
Xiaoman, remember to appreciate
Mr. Yu's kindness.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.110
People these days

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.430
can be so cold.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.220
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.980
Mr. Yu.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.380
What's this?

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:47.860
A dog.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.780
No kidding.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.990
I even know its name is Dao.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.110
Xia Xiaoman's in the hospital.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.640
She asked me to look after it
for a few days.

00:16:53.662 --> 00:16:54.620
We don't need dogs here.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.900
I'm giving you half a day off.
Take it home.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.310
Seriously, Mr. Yu?

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.380
What if he makes a mess?

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.740
And it whines all the time.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.630
It's not noisy. It's adorable.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:07.750
Adorable?

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.910
Such a weird-looking animal.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.990
Left paw.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.620
Right paw.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.150
Good boy.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.020
Here you go.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.100
Open wide.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.230
Xia Xiaoman trusts you a lot.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.106
This dog is like her kid.

00:17:30.128 --> 00:17:32.020
She trusts you enough
to put it in your care.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.528
And you didn't even ask
if I'd be okay with it.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.060
Do you like it that much?

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.470
Who, the dog or Xia Xiaoman?

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.820
Aren't you two best friends already?

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:52.820
Which is why

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.190
she should've asked me.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.260
Why'd she ask you?

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.500
I happened to visit her in the hospital.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.910
You went to the hospital?

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.390
Even Qing and I haven't gone yet.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.580
You were the first.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.710
Mr. Yu told me to go.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.950
Mr. Yu.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.150
It's always Mr. Yu.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.500
What is it this time?

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.390
Nothing.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.470
So...

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.100
Can I keep it?

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.180
Sure.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.180
Good evening.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.180
What's the dog doing here?

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:43.020
Thanks to it,
Xiaoxiao isn't smiling anymore.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.190
She made you choose

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.270
between her and the dog,

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.910
and you chose the woman.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.580
I chose peace.

00:18:53.306 --> 00:18:54.430
Mr. Yu, I'm begging you.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.340
Take it for two days.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.180
Heh.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.340
- You...
- Let go.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.180
Please.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.150
Just a few days, Mr. Yu.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.340
No. Let go.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.180
I'm not letting go.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.190
Let go!

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.030
Hey.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.390
Just help him for two days.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.260
Why're you here?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.390
I'm here to get Xiaoman
a change of clothes.

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:12.870
Xiaoxiao, you're here too.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.710
Xiaoxiao!

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.230
You can take the dog to a pet hospital.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.430
Where are we supposed
to find one this late?

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.500
Can't you just look after it
for a few days?

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.430
Not even a second.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.740
Fine.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.706
Then don't come to me
for medical help anymore.

00:19:31.728 --> 00:19:33.060
Then I'll go to the pet hospital.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.580
Wu, ignore him.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.940
We're leaving.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.617
Go to the pet hospital all you want.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.660
Dr. Gu,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.820
got any ideas?

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.540
Humans are one thing,

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.100
but I'm trying to figure out
why this guy won't even

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.950
let a dog into his place.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.580
Dr. Gu, stop complaining about Mr. Yu.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.260
He's not the point right now.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.150
The problem is the dog.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.420
Yeah.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.740
What about the dog?

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.710
What about me?

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:24.670
Who's flashing that light?

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.710
Mr. Yu.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.580
Why're you here?

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.020
Five days, and five days only.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.060
So you do have a heart.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:39.990
Mr. Yu,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.100
you're not worried Dr. Gu
will ignore you, are you?

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.190
Of course not.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.740
This is compassion.

00:20:45.795 --> 00:20:47.220
I'm showing compassion for you guys.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.260
Whatever you say.
Thanks for saving my life.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.950
- Come on, Dao.
- Go on.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:51.790
Come on. Down.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:00.740
Inside here is its dog food

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.580
and its toys.

00:21:12.817 --> 00:21:14.470
Do you know how to take care of a dog?

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.470
You must be hungry.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.980
(How much should a pug eat each meal?)

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.620
(Young puppies eat
around 50-70 grams a day.)

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.884
(Older puppies and adult pugs
need about 80 grams a day.)

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:55.910
I'll get you some food.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.470
A good meal starts with the right bowl.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.030
Go on, eat.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:44.750
Eat.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.870
I know you're annoyed
that I tied you up,

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.190
but I have to.

00:22:51.217 --> 00:22:53.470
There are lots of things in my place
you can't touch.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.390
Like my speakers,

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.780
my records, and my models.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.100
None of them is for you, got it?

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.230
Suit yourself.

00:23:55.951 --> 00:23:57.500
A hunger strike isn't going to work.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.820
Eat or don't.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.710
Look at me. I'm enjoying my dinner.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.100
If you keep refusing,
I'll throw away your food.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.230
If you keep refusing,
I'll throw you out too.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.230
You hear me?

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:58.990
We'll get you to the operating room now.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.580
Xiaoman.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.340
Dr. Gu, why're you here?

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.580
I was worried you'd be nervous.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.820
I am a bit.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.100
Can I make a call first?

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.500
Sure. Who're you calling?

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.260
Shen Wu. I'm worried about Dao.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.870
Then maybe don't call.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.470
Why?

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.190
Dao's with Mr. Yu.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.100
What? Why with him?

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.100
Don't worry.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.580
Mr. Yu will take good care of Dao.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.990
No. I'm not doing the surgery.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.284
Take her to the operating room.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.740
Dr. Gu, I need to save Dao!

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.230
I need to save Dao!

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.020
Just accept your fate. Be good.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.990
The client is here.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.300
Please come in, Mr. Li.

00:25:43.328 --> 00:25:44.773
- Hello.
- Please have a seat.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.660
Hello.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.580
Mr. Li,
should we pick up from the budget?

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.910
I've thought
about increasing the budget.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:25:59.750
Don't.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.190
Please carry on.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.060
I want to add another 50,000.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:11.230
No.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.430
Maybe

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.580
eighty thousand?

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.710
Dao, come out!

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.100
Dao!

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.100
Hello?

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.780
Mr. Yu, how is Dao?

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.580
Your Dao has no manners at all.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.670
Can you turn on the video
so I can see it?

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:03.900
No.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.100
Why?

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.540
Because I ate it.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:11.630
What are you doing?

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.150
Why are you scaring Xiaoman?

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.990
Don't worry.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.820
Mr. Yu won't eat Dao.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.190
But what if he does?
He's so greedy and loves meat.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.230
Why is this person so annoying?

00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:35.430
You really have no problem?

00:27:36.951 --> 00:27:38.870
Since you're so rarely asking me
for help,

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.060
of course I won't refuse.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.710
Besides, it affects whether you
can work with peace of mind.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.550
Right?

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.260
Okay then, I'll leave it to you.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.100
Don't worry.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.390
Dao.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.230
Good boy.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.580
Cute Dao.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.840
This dog's name is Dao,
and I'm the one called Dao, okay?

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:58.100
Of course, I know that.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.300
Right, Dao?

00:28:02.151 --> 00:28:04.260
Didn't you just say
that your allergy to dog hair

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.100
had been cured?

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.470
I'm allergic to pollen.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:08.780
Where are the flowers this season?

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:13.780
Never mind.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.150
Give it to me, hurry.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.150
Forget it.

00:28:16.151 --> 00:28:17.300
- Give it to me.
- Let go.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.190
I can really do it.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.030
Go.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.830
Dao.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.630
Dao, go home with me.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:23.910
I will take care of you.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.780
Is Dao cute?

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.150
Cute.

00:28:37.684 --> 00:28:39.740
Then I'll bring it over to play
with you for a few days, okay?

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.300
Okay, I want to play with Dao.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.190
Okay.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.670
Eh, no.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.300
I'm allergic to dog fur.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.150
I'll sneeze and get rashes.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.190
No, I want to play with Dao.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:51.390
Yeah, she wants to play.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.300
You'll get used to it. Don't worry.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.340
What do you mean she'll get used to it?

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.150
Allergies are allergies.

00:28:59.084 --> 00:29:00.484
People these days are unbelievable.

00:29:00.484 --> 00:29:02.100
Don't get married when they should,

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.020
and just raise a dog.

00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:04.740
We're not learning from her.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.300
Never wanted to.

00:29:08.973 --> 00:29:11.060
Mom, look, the dog is making trouble
in my home.

00:29:11.128 --> 00:29:12.630
How am I supposed to live here?

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:13.820
Impossible to live.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.990
If not, let me take care of it
for a few days.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.430
Fine, have you ever raised a dog?

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.630
I raised you.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.910
Then it's settled.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.195
Come with me later to pick it up.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.990
What do you mean settled?

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.430
I have conditions.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:30.470
What conditions?

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.060
Treat Yejia to a meal.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.710
Then you plan to spy on us, right?

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.430
Wrong, I'm going to watch openly.

00:29:39.728 --> 00:29:41.100
All three of us will eat together.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.710
Forget it.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.260
Grandma, I want to raise Dao.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.020
Your mom is allergic.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.470
If we keep it,
your mom's body will get itchy.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.670
Do you want your mom to be itchy?

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.580
Yes.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.740
Yu, Mom.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.580
Where are you going?

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.710
We're heading back.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.820
You're going home?

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.580
- Leaving.
- We're leaving.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.710
Okay, Mom.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.710
Mom, aren't you staying a few more days?

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.580
See? See how popular I am?

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.820
I'll go home and get some more clothes.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.100
Then come stay for more days.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.380
We're leaving.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.710
She'll stay for more days.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.390
Really. I am getting old.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.820
It's raining today.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.340
How did I remember it as tomorrow?

00:30:36.862 --> 00:30:38.740
All because you insisted
on taking the subway.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.740
Why not take a taxi?

00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:42.500
Mom, the dog is acting up at home again.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.820
Be a bit frugal.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.340
Alright, I'll listen to you.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.910
You insisted on keeping it.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:22.710
What are you doing?

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.060
Why are you here?

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.430
I'm getting pants for Xiaoman.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.740
I don't have her pants here.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.260
Might as well bring some food.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:31.230
I'm not eating.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.340
It's for the dog.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:37.740
Let's discuss this.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.340
Otherwise, I'll just take Dao away.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.910
I think with my hospital colleagues,

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:45.340
we can manage it in shifts
for a few days.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.340
Not now.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.100
Or let me check on it.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.150
I'll take some photos.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.230
I'll send videos to Xiaoman.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:52.230
Don't try to go in.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.260
Then let it out.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.190
It can't come out.

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.150
Why?

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.150
Because I'm performing
a dissection on it.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:31:59.990
I...

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.670
Let me in. Open the door.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.340
Hey, honey.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.340
I'm walking Mimi.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.500
She's doing well. Very obedient.

00:32:21.817 --> 00:32:23.710
She really likes playing
with other puppies.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:24.550
Are you scared of it?

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.580
Don't be. Bite it.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.060
- Bite it, go.
- Alright.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:29.710
So timid.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:30.740
It's fine.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.740
I've run into a lunatic.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:34.910
It ran!

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.260
Mimi!

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.260
Mimi!

Dao, I'm back.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.540
What are you doing?

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.460
Dao.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.860
You...

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:54.230
Go away.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.100
What's wrong with you?

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.660
Didn't I tell you not to touch my stuff?

00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:59.270
Go downstairs.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:04.950
Hey, where do you live?

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.110
Here.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.990
Why did you suddenly send Dao to me?

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.500
It broke my trophy,

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.100
and also ruined my RC car.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.500
It's a dog.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.270
How can you argue with a dog?

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.390
I know it's a dog.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:30.790
But I'm also a victim.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.270
Both dogs and humans make mistakes.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:33.580
You have to learn to forgive.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:34.910
Do you know? I won that trophy

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:36.620
by beating 23 opponents.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.319
All the screws on my car
are titanium alloy,

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.430
and tested in a wind tunnel.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.470
Are you going to stand there

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.910
and say everything you want to say?

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:51.870
You want me to go in?

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.100
Of course.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.950
Do you think I'm as rude as you?

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.060
Forget it. Goodbye.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.180
Hey, what's wrong?

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.990
Feed 80 grams of dog food.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.180
Got it.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.830
Use clean water when washing its paws.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:22.220
Steak medium rare.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.540
No black pepper sauce.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.540
That's for peasants.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.220
Anything else to say?

00:37:32.706 --> 00:37:33.790
It's afraid of big dogs.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.060
(Gu Yejia)

00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:58.710
Hey.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:59.790
Mr. Yu.

00:37:59.884 --> 00:38:01.790
Dao is digging in the trash.
What should I do?

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:02.630
Bear with it.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.020
Isn't there another way?

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.910
Humans and dogs both make mistakes.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.862
- Alright.
- You have to learn to be tolerant.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.270
Okay.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:19.950
Better to send it away after all.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.580
Ou Yang posted another video.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.195
What is he showing off this time?

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:40.310
Look.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.950
(It's nice to have someone
welcome you home.)

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:45.750
Plus fine wine and beautiful women?

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.430
Who would welcome him?

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.790
He has three beautiful women.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.060
Dating without the intention
of marriage is just messing around.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.950
I actually hope someone
welcomes me home.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:01.270
Xiaoxiao gets off work later than me,
yet I'm the one welcoming her.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.910
I need to learn from you.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.620
That mindset of opening the door
to an empty home without caring.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.270
Get lost.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.470
Alright.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.430
Mr. Yu.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.180
You're here too.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:28.900
Sit.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:30.190
Same as usual?

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:31.270
Yes.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:34.950
I heard you recently got a dog.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.790
I especially bought a dog collar
for you in Paris.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.020
Do you like it?

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:40.830
I really like this brand.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.220
Very thoughtful, thank you.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.310
You must treat your dog well.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.430
Because dogs are humanity's
best friends.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.580
You're right.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.580
Mr. Yu, do you have a dog?

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:54.940
No.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.580
Dao, slow down.

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.100
Dao, slow down. I can't keep up.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:07.910
Dao.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:10.620
Dao!

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.790
Dao, slow down.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.990
Dao, wait.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.350
I need water, Dao.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.910
Come, I'm dying of thirst.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.220
Dao, don't move.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.540
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:28.110
Hey.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:29.750
Have you eaten?

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.060
Yes.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.020
I mean the dog.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.660
The dog ate too.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:36.180
How much dog food?

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:37.990
A big handful, I guess.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:39.462
You're walking the dog now, right?

00:41:39.462 --> 00:41:40.230
Yes.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:41.660
Here's some advice.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.100
Don't let it lead you.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.100
You need to be in control, understand?

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.100
It doesn't listen to me.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:48.870
Negotiate with it.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.350
Negotiate with a dog?

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.470
It's Dao.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.870
Alright, I'll negotiate with it.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:54.940
Dao...

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:56.590
Dao.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.220
Dao is gone.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.700
What? You...

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.540
Did you tie it nearby just now?

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.430
Yes.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.140
It can pull itself free.

00:42:05.084 --> 00:42:06.990
I'm done talking to you.
I went looking for Dao.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.020
Dao.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.140
- Hey.
- Dao.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.220
So dumb.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.220
Dao.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.390
Let's go, Sir.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.790
Dao.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.540
Dao.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:28.180
Sir, please hurry.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.340
Okay.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.790
Dao!

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.430
Dao!

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.430
Dao.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:43.430
Mr. Yu.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.020
Where's Dao?

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.310
Is that Dao over there?

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:49.750
What?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.119
