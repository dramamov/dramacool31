Do both of you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.279
already know

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:09.879
that we can't keep this house anymore?

♪Lost in the heart of the city♪

when we were at the cemetery.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.159
Thankfully,

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.800
Mingzhu was smart

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.380
and transferred her wedding house
to herself.

00:02:31.942 --> 00:02:32.640

Something so serious
happened to Meiqi's family?

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.480
All of Nanxi knows this.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.360
You don't know?

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.040
Don't you read the classmate group chat?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.480
I don't.

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.119
How did you join the gathering
if you didn't read it?

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.559
How did you meet Feng Meiqi again?

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.159
I...

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.200
I stopped reading it
after I got together with you.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.760
Many lessons are given
in the third year. I'm very busy.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.240
Mr. Hu, you are a good man.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.559
A reward for you.

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:23.399
Then...

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.399
How is Meiqi doing now?

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.040
Can I ask?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.320
Of course, you can.

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.080
Meiqi... She's in bad shape now.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.559
As a former classmate

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:40.839
and ex-boyfriend of hers,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.200
you should help her out.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.839
How?

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:48.360
Speak to her

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.640
and treat her to a meal?

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.119
Don't forget a hug filled with love.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.839
Can I even do that?

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:54.760
What do you think?

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.800
I don't think so.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.510
Have you been studying so much
that you've turned into a fool?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.599
Don't you know

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.640
what you can and cannot do?

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:03.360
I don't know.

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:04.879
Teach me.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.960
What should I do?

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.480
Let me tell you.

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.040
Feng Meiqi

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.320
will surely lose her house.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.460
Before the court seizes the house,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.460
bring as many things as you can
out of the house.

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:17.599
Isn't that illegal?

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:18.880
How is that illegal?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.660
Feng's family put the house on a mortgage
and not the items inside it.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.039
Let's go.

00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:26.799
Mister.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.281
The plug.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.000
The plug.

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:33.960
(In this family,)

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:35.440
(I am pregnant,)

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.120
(Feng Meiqi is unemployed)

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.880
(and my mother-in-law can't even work.)

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.120
(We are willing to take on the debt)

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.799
Mingzhu.

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:46.039
(but the people owing money
must first survive)

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.490
(before they can pay the money back.)

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.239
It's fine.

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:50.799
(Television, computer,
hair drying machine,)

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:53.440
(sofa, coffee table, refrigerator,)

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.479
(and Meiqi's luxury items.)

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.320
(We'll find buyers before
we sell them to second-hand resellers.)

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.320
(What we need to do now)

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.560
(is to turn everything)

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.799
(into cold hard cash.)

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:07.479
Hello.

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:09.359
Hello.

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.039
We are here to see the dining table.

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.880
Yes. This is the dining table.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.239
Take a look.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.919
This dining table is made from redwood.

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.359
The materials are very good.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:19.320
Yes.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.560
My dad asked a factory

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.039
to customize it.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.799
Even the carvings were done by hand.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.399
I'm sure you spent a lot

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:26.760
buying this back then.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.719
Yes.

00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:29.880
It was more than 100,000 yuan
after the discount.

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.399
20,000 for it now

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:32.440
is a steal.

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:35.039
20,000 yuan is not expensive.

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.060
It's made with real wood.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.680
You can't even move it with a few people.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:38.880
This is a good item.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.120
Yes. It's pure redwood.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.399
Moreover, it holds its value.

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:44.919
We've been taking good care of it.

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.399
It doesn't have any scratches.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.560
Look. The shine is still there.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.719
Yes.

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.490
If you are interested
in this dining table,

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.479
I'll just give you the chairs as well.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.200
- Is that so?
- Such a good deal?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.719
Yes.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:56.719
The chairs are good.

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:57.760
Sure. We'll take them.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.320
I'll ask two people to move it later.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.880
Sure.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.560
Scan my QR code.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.000
Sure.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.359
Let me move the box away.

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:05.080
Kid,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.239
we don't include delivery fees.

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.760
No problem.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.320
You can take a look at
the other furniture in this house.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.359
If you see anything you like,
you can buy it too.

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:16.050
Are you selling this sofa?
It's quite nice.

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.960
Yes.

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:18.399
No!

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:21.599
No!

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:26.599
Feng loves it the most.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.120
It's not for sale at any price.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.887
What's wrong
with something used by Feng?

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.919
Is he the emperor?

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.359
Are his things valuable
now that he is dead?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.880
Are they antiques now?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.279
Might as well seal off his grave
and charge people to visit him

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.399
to pay the debt.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.159
That's enough. He's already dead.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.359
Why are you saying that?

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:54.159
No.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.799
People die leaving a legacy

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:58.039
but he died

00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.560
leaving a lot of debt.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.719
How will his family live

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:02.799
for the rest of their lives?

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.000
I thought

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.440
he was the one in his family
who was sensible.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.039
Now, I have realized

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.640
Feng was the most unreliable one.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.680
You can't say that.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.399
Feng is good enough.

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.060
If it weren't for him, his house would not
have been transferred to Mingzhu.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.159
Forget about it.

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:18.200
Him?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.080
That's because Mingzhu fought for it.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.239
Mingzhu is like me.

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:26.520
She's a good judge of character.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.760
She knows Feng

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:30.200
is an empty shell.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.599
A good judge of character?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760
Judge my character.

00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:35.120
Now?

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.640
The first day I knew you,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.279
I knew my life would be over.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.440
I'll be trapped

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.560
and no longer escape.

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:42.320
That Yu too.

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:44.520
The first day I saw her,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.120
I knew she wasn't a good person.

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.320
Yu Jingxiang?

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.320
How is she any fragrant?

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.479
She stinks.

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:56.919
Zhilu.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.520
I was wondering

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:02.839
why Zhilu has such a terrible fate.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.039
Zhixia

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:07.159
sent me a text on WeChat to tell me

00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:09.656
that Zhilu is helping the Feng family
sell their furniture.

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:11.552
The furniture

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.719
is good.

00:08:13.719 --> 00:08:16.000
They sold them at a cheap price.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.479
There was no choice.

00:08:18.359 --> 00:08:19.399
They were in trouble.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.120
Why don't we buy their furniture

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.560
and keep it in our old house.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.000
After a few years,

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:31.680
when the incident is over,

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:33.400
we'll return it to Zhilu.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.239
What do you think?

00:08:35.239 --> 00:08:36.040
Great. Dacheng.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.200
Your idea is really good.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.119
What about the money?

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.479
We'll sell the sidecar.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.839
Selling the sidecar?

00:08:49.239 --> 00:08:50.400
Are you willing to do that?

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:53.080
We must help Zhilu after all.

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:56.359
Forget it.

00:08:56.359 --> 00:08:58.599
That old house is leaking.

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:00.400
It's damp and wet.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.920
The furniture will rot

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.879
if there's acid rain.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:05.400
Besides,

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.479
we shouldn't bite off
more than we can chew.

00:09:08.479 --> 00:09:09.519
Are we not going to help her?

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.519
Of course, we are helping.

00:09:15.359 --> 00:09:16.280
We'll save money.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.400
We'll save up bit by bit.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.680
Let's be frugal.

00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:21.119
I'll quit smoking.

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:22.280
That's right.

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:23.879
When the time comes,

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:26.519
and Zhilu gives birth

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.160
to our grandson,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.519
we'll spend money and effort
to take care of him.

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.080
All right?

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:38.719
When I think about her mom...

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.879
Her mom...

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.960
Which mom?

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:45.479
I am the mom.

00:09:46.359 --> 00:09:47.920
I am the biological mother.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.999
Three meters.

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:54.879
Three meters.

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:57.200
Mom.

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:58.599
It won't work.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.519
Mingzhu's house has a small living room.

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:02.280
The big sofa can't fit.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.680
Get rid of it then.

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:04.599
Mom.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.119
Jianqi picked this sofa.

00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:08.639
I want to keep it.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.400
Jianqi has bad taste.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.119
He only picked things that look cheap.

00:10:12.119 --> 00:10:13.240
Why do you want to keep it?

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:15.440
Forget it.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.239
Who are you looking for?

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.200
Hello, we are looking for
the owner of 8001.

00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:22.400
I am.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.759
We are from

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.119
Nanzhou New City Civil Court.

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:26.260
What do you want?

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.519
There's a mortgage

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.879
on this house.

00:10:29.119 --> 00:10:31.359
According to Article 255
of the Civil Procedure Law,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.719
we are going to seize this place.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.479
This is the summons.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.960
Please sign it.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.860
Please move away
from this place within a week.

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:02.140
We are going to put seals on it.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.359
This is over.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.680
We can't protect the house.

00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:26.320
We'll be homeless soon.

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:30.239
Mom.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.759
Although we couldn't
protect the big house,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.879
we still have this small one.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.999
You and Meiqi

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:38.320
can move here.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.320
Bring your sofa here as well.

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:42.920
Keep an open mind.

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:50.479
Your neighbors say you are toxic.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.119
You are really toxic.

00:11:55.479 --> 00:11:56.639
What are you talking about?

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:00.719
When I couldn't sleep at night,

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:01.680
I lay in bed

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.960
and tumble around thinking

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:04.879
why.

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:05.879
Why must the Feng family

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:07.999
suffer so much?

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.879
After all,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.680
it's all you.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:18.999
Mom.

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:22.239
It's because of me.

00:12:23.719 --> 00:12:24.999
I was too willful.

00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:26.719
It has nothing to do with Mingzhu.

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:28.320
It does.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.280
If something hadn't happened
to your brother,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.879
would you return from abroad?

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.759
If your brother weren't her boyfriend,

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:35.960
would something happen to her?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.479
Since they got married,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.359
the Feng family

00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:43.680
has suffered one tragedy after another.

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:45.879
In less than half a year,

00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:47.680
all the men in our family died.

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:50.680
All the men in our family are dead.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.280
Mom.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.960
What are you doing?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.999
Who are you calling Mom?

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.839
Go away. Don't stand here.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.639
I'm telling you.

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:00.920
We no longer want the child.

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:03.400
The Feng family is destined
to have no descendants.

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:06.599
What?

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.400
Feng Meiqi,

00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:11.040
don't be afraid. I'm here.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.239
Can you stop this?

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.599
Can you stop this?

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.519
Do you know the situation now?

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.599
Do you know the situation now, Mom?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.920
Do we have many people in our family?

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.639
Why are you still
chasing other people away,

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:24.280
Mom?

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:26.119
What's wrong with her?

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:28.560
Meiqi.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.560
Baby.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.040
Don't be afraid.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.040
Mom,

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.719
stop doing this.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.680
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.759
Meiqi.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.719
What are you two doing?

00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:48.839
You were bad last night.

00:13:53.719 --> 00:13:54.960
This motorbike looks good.

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:57.359
It also has Nanzhou plates.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.879
This is worth something.

00:13:59.719 --> 00:14:00.920
Are you selling this?

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.960
I'm still considering it.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.400
I want to know the market value.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.680
Not bad.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:07.920
This motorcycle must be quite old.

00:14:08.239 --> 00:14:10.160
Ten whole years.

00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:12.920
But I've maintained it well.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.080
Listen to the engine.

00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:17.040
You're amazing.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.719
Incredible.

00:14:18.648 --> 00:14:20.400
You've maintained your bike well.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.280
It's not bad.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.519
You are also a bike lover.

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:26.239
Why are you selling it?

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.440
My eldest daughter is pregnant.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.599
My second daughter is pregnant.

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:37.599
My daughter-in-law is also pregnant.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.999
Shouldn't I give them red packets?

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:39.920
Of course.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.999
You are blessed.

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:42.119
Three grandchildren at once.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.639
This is a good bike.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.920
I won't even trade it for a BMW.

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:49.800
A bike is not as good as babies.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.759
Right?

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.040
Three babies mean three red packets.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.719
Every Chinese New Year,
it's three red packets as well.

00:14:56.999 --> 00:14:59.400
It's also three red packets
on their birthdays.

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:00.879
Enough talk.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.040
Name your price.

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.239
Sure.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.160
Your bike is great.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.719
It's amazing.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.119
However, it's a ten-year-old car.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.440
It's an old car.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.160
I won't fool you.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.200
I'll give you my price.

00:15:15.479 --> 00:15:16.400
It's an honest one.

00:15:17.239 --> 00:15:17.920
This much.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.479
Are you trying to cause trouble?

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.560
Not at all.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.280
Why don't you give me a price?

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.320
How can I name my price?

00:15:28.999 --> 00:15:29.800
When I'm not selling,

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:32.560
you're praising this bike.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.920
Now that I'm selling, you're only giving value
to the plate alone.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.680
Isn't that causing trouble?

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:38.920
No, Sir. Look.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.719
Think it through.

00:15:39.719 --> 00:15:40.839
Move.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.920
Reconsider it.

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:45.960
Think about it!

00:15:47.239 --> 00:15:48.239
He's quite stubborn.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.639
Why are you carrying things?

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:56.359
It's fine, Mom.

00:15:56.359 --> 00:15:57.160
Put it down. No.

00:15:57.359 --> 00:15:59.519
It's the mid-term now.
The most stable period.

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:00.879
You can't do it no matter when.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.119
Don't hit it.

00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:02.999
Mingzhu, stop working.

00:16:02.999 --> 00:16:03.719
I'll do it later.

00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:04.680
Let me do it.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.119
Sure.

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:07.479
The bed is here.

00:16:07.479 --> 00:16:08.359
Move.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.879
Go inside first.

00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:10.479
Mingzhu.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:11.759
Be careful.

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:12.080
All right.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.400
This way? Let me go inside first.

00:16:13.479 --> 00:16:14.400
Yes. Do it slowly.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.839
Give us some space.

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:16.560
Sure.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.960
We don't want to hit you.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.680
I'll go out.

00:16:18.759 --> 00:16:19.800
Sir, carry it higher.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.239
Sure.

00:16:21.239 --> 00:16:21.759
Come.

00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:27.239
If you put the single bed here.

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:28.920
What about the crib?

00:16:29.719 --> 00:16:30.599
Why don't we

00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:31.960
put this in my room?

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.680
Let me do it.

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.479
I can do it. Don't move.

00:16:35.479 --> 00:16:37.040
- It's all right.
- Let me do it.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.719
Let me do it.

00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:38.359
Together.

00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:39.800
One, two, three.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.160
Okay.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.200
Slowly.

00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:41.920
Don't move.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.400
Be careful.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.359
- It's all right.
- Okay.

00:16:43.359 --> 00:16:43.920
Mind your feet.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.479
You can push it from here.

00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:46.320
Mind the step.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:46.920
Okay.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:47.585
It has wheels at the bottom.

00:16:47.599 --> 00:16:48.160
Sure.

00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:49.119
Okay.

00:16:49.479 --> 00:16:50.239
Let's push it.

00:16:50.239 --> 00:16:50.759
Let's go.

00:16:52.239 --> 00:16:53.280
Where should I put it?

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.359
By the window.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.440
Come on.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:01.750
How's this place?

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.759
Sure. This is good.

00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:06.239
It's heavy.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:08.680
Hu Gang.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.920
Thank you.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:11.960
You're welcome.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:13.999
Will Ni be upset

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:16.279
about you coming here?

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.950
She was the one
who asked me to come here.

00:17:19.479 --> 00:17:21.440
Ni asked me to tell you you're welcome.

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:25.960
Thankfully,

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.200
we are not together.

00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:31.200
Don't say that.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.680
What do you mean?

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.960
I mean

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.440
what you said just now was right.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.160
It's quite good.

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:50.200
This house

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.239
is now

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.039
so cramped.

00:17:56.479 --> 00:17:57.640
Think about it in a good way.

00:17:57.999 --> 00:17:59.519
At least, we've protected this house.

00:18:01.719 --> 00:18:02.840
It's all because of you.

00:18:03.239 --> 00:18:04.559
If you didn't fight for this house

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.880
at the price of being scolded,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.920
both of them
will have to stay under a bridge.

00:18:08.479 --> 00:18:09.960
She's not satisfied

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.519
with gossiping

00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:11.680
and she's also complaining.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.799
Last time,

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:15.079
she even blamed us for his son's death.

00:18:15.079 --> 00:18:17.039
If she hadn't driven the car away...

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:19.200
- How could she blame us?
- Enough.

00:18:19.479 --> 00:18:21.079
Look how pretentious she is.

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:23.640
She ruins a good family.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.400
Why are you talking about this?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.239
They might have a camera in the curtain
that records everything you say.

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:31.759
No. I'm just angry.

00:18:31.759 --> 00:18:34.039
Her attitude that day...

00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:35.079
Mingzhu.

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:36.479
Do you remember

00:18:36.479 --> 00:18:38.200
the story I told you last time?

00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:39.319
What story?

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.450
The story about
releasing the Ginseng Lady three times.

00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:43.799
Nagua caught the Ginseng Lady

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:44.960
and kept releasing her

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.319
time after time.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.559
Your grandfather says you're foolish.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.319
He said you were

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:54.360
a happy-go-lucky,

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.279
fussy and naggy,

00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:57.920
and heartless...

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.920
Big fool.

00:19:00.835 --> 00:19:02.115
Don't you know what time it is?

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:04.519
How can you still joke?

00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:07.319
Mingzhu.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.920
You are right to do this.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.840
You are a pillar of this family now.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.279
If you can't endure it one day,

00:19:17.479 --> 00:19:18.279
just come home.

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.160
We'll always have a bed for you at home.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.559
You still have your foolish parents.

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:32.519
Sam,

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:33.920
the public account has been banned.

00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:35.680
It takes time to appeal.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.999
I have no idea as well.

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:38.479
I'm also in despair.

00:19:38.479 --> 00:19:40.319
Let's not be anxious.

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.519
I understand you.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.079
However, we only see data.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.319
Look. We had a promise

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.519
for you
to give us three articles a month.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.079
However, you only wrote two

00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:53.079
so the system deemed it
a contract violation.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.252
You can't reason with a machine.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.039
No,

00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:57.640
machines are controlled by humans.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.319
We cannot be controlled by humans.

00:19:59.319 --> 00:20:00.400
You are right.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.799
We call this smart system internally

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:03.680
as the Foolish system.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.440
Our boss spent a lot of money

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.840
to import it from abroad.

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:11.239
If you oppose it,

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:13.160
you're indirectly opposing our boss.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.519
So, we must firmly protect it.

00:20:16.759 --> 00:20:17.960
We also named it

00:20:18.319 --> 00:20:19.279
Big Smart.

00:20:21.999 --> 00:20:22.719
Sam,

00:20:22.999 --> 00:20:24.999
don't you have any way
to help me at all?

00:20:24.999 --> 00:20:25.640
Miss,

00:20:26.079 --> 00:20:27.559
there's no way.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.700
We must do things
according to the contract.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.440
So, I can't pay you

00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:36.840
this month's promotion fee.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.360
Zhixia, you should get back to work.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.799
I have a meeting later.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:05.680
Hello.

00:21:06.239 --> 00:21:06.960
Hello, Zhixia.

00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:08.279
Are you free tonight?

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.880
Chen and I want to treat you to dinner.

00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:15.239
Am I free or not?

00:21:17.719 --> 00:21:18.400
I guess I'm free.

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:23.680
Mr. Xu, it's rare for you to treat me.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.479
Should I order politely

00:21:25.479 --> 00:21:26.999
or order as I wish?

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:28.160
Don't worry.

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:29.680
I've arranged everything.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.079
Here's your three-person set.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.160
Set?

00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:43.999
Four dishes and a soup.

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:45.319
It's the standard.

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:47.799
Xu Zhidong made a bulk purchase.

00:21:48.079 --> 00:21:49.160
118 yuan.

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:53.479
Bichen.

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:55.960
Before you two got married,

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.079
I was shy to ask.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.640
Now that both of you are married,

00:21:59.999 --> 00:22:01.640
I'll ask you bravely

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.400
why you fall for Xu Zhidong.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.999
He knows how to live a life.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.559
How is this living life?

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:07.559
He's just stingy.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.840
Young people

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:11.640
are all lovestruck.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.390
The dipping sauce contains ginger.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.079
Waitress.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.400
Give me a dipping sauce without ginger.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:18.999
Sure.

00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:20.840
Xu Zhidong,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.680
you've never

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.039
treated Mom and me so considerately.

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:25.880
You shouldn't cause trouble like this.

00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:27.999
I... How am I not being considerate?

00:22:28.479 --> 00:22:28.960
Then...

00:22:29.479 --> 00:22:30.680
When you argued with Zhang Hao,

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.440
weren't I firmly supporting you

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.640
every time?

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.039
What do you mean?

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.950
Were you supposed to
support Zhang Hao instead?

00:22:36.999 --> 00:22:38.279
Are you Zhang Hao's sibling?

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:39.999
Adults are too emotional.

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:41.279
Don't argue with Zhixia.

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:41.999
I'm not arguing.

00:22:41.999 --> 00:22:43.039
I won't do it.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.160
Zhixia, I have something important
to discuss with you.

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:49.479
You treat me to a 118-yuan bulk purchase
meal to discuss something important?

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.600
Bichen,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.999
was he so stingy

00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:54.160
when both of you were dating?

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.200
What's so bad about a stingy man?

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.680
He won't cheat on me.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.200
Yes.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.039
I didn't spend the money I saved.

00:23:00.039 --> 00:23:01.559
I give every cent to her.

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:03.840
Yes. Zhang Hao is the same.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.559
Let's talk business.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.079
I heard Dad say

00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:09.640
he was going to sell his motorcycle

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.719
to help Mingzhu.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.719
Is he willing to do that?

00:23:12.719 --> 00:23:14.160
Of course, not.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.999
So, I was thinking...

00:23:17.759 --> 00:23:19.200
So, you are thinking

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.880
about asking me to buy Dad's motorcycle

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.519
and use the money

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:26.799
to give Mingzhu
while returning the motorcycle to Dad?

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.519
Exactly.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.559
What is your role in all of this?

00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:34.160
Think about the idea, that's all?

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.640
Or treating me

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.079
to a 118-yuan bulk purchase meal?

00:23:37.079 --> 00:23:38.740
This meal is too expensive.
I can't afford to eat it.

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:39.519
Zhixia,

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:40.440
don't be angry.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.600
Zhidong was just joking.

00:23:43.719 --> 00:23:44.440
We came here

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.999
to discuss with you that each family
will give 20,000 yuan to Dad.

00:23:47.999 --> 00:23:49.960
Think of it as a gift for him.

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:55.519
Not bad.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.160
You act like a man now.

00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:00.160
Bichen,

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.319
it's true.

00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:03.640
Since marrying you,

00:24:03.999 --> 00:24:05.400
Xu Zhidong has been a sensible man.

00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:07.519
Your education works.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.880
The credit's all mine.

00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:12.360
Fine.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.319
I agree.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.880
Can I order another portion of potato
slices after contributing 20,000 yuan,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.479
Mr. Xu.

00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:21.840
Waitress, get me another portion
of potato slices.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.360
Mom, you're back.

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:35.479
It seems like you are studying.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.440
You are very self-aware.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.519
Let me praise you.

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:41.960
Studying makes my mom happy.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.740
Have you settled
the public account incident?

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:49.120
Not yet. Don't mention it.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.719
This annoys me.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.239
I won't mention it anymore.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.550
Being happy is the most important.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.239
Didn't your younger brother treat you?

00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:58.039
What did you eat?

00:24:58.519 --> 00:24:59.160
A feast.

00:25:00.479 --> 00:25:01.239
Bulk purchase.

00:25:01.519 --> 00:25:03.279
118 yuan for four dishes and one soup.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.719
He's more stingy than I am.

00:25:04.719 --> 00:25:06.500
It matches
your younger brother's character.

00:25:07.759 --> 00:25:08.999
You don't say.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.519
After Xu Zhidong was married,

00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:13.200
he became very sensible.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.160
He told me

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.440
he wanted to pool up money
to help Mingzhu.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.039
I notice marriage really changes

00:25:22.039 --> 00:25:23.400
a person's fate.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.920
You and your mom
worked hard for 20 years

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.120
and still failed
to change your younger brother.

00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:29.719
When Yuan Bichen came along,

00:25:29.719 --> 00:25:31.400
she changed him completely.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.519
I should also learn from Bichen

00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:37.200
and change you.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.400
Do I need to be changed?

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:40.120
I'm improving myself.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:40.719
See?

00:25:41.239 --> 00:25:41.999
A speech.

00:25:42.719 --> 00:25:44.319
Respected Nanzhou...

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.079
I'll praise you as well.

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:54.960
It's safe now that I'm in my mid-term.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360
Go and take a bath.

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.479
It's embarrassing to say that.

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:07.400
Jiao.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.150
Forget it
if you can't finish your homework.

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:10.120
Get ready to sleep.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.279
Right now?

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.890
You must combine work and rest.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.750
It's almost time for the Chinese New Year.

00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:25.120
Ribs.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:25.999
Mom.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.079
It's done?

00:26:27.079 --> 00:26:27.640
Give it to me.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.680
No. Sit down.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.279
Sit down.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.880
I've not cooked for a long time.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.519
I wonder how my cooking is.

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:43.360
Just make do with whatever I made.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:43.920
Mom,

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.479
they look delicious.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.840
Mingzhu. Meiqi.

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:53.799
I've always

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.640
made complaints

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.400
when I encounter problems.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.880
I always say the wrong thing

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.479
and I'm sure I've hurt both of you.

00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:03.519
Allow me to apologize to you two today.

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:04.400
Sorry.

00:27:04.479 --> 00:27:05.039
Mom,

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:06.160
we are a family.

00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:07.519
Don't say that.

00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:10.400
Mingzhu and I have never blamed you.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.960
I know that.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.719
I know.

00:27:12.719 --> 00:27:14.920
Both of you are my good daughters.

00:27:16.239 --> 00:27:17.400
Eat.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.440
We...

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:25.479
From tomorrow onward,

00:27:25.479 --> 00:27:27.519
this is no longer our home.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.120
But we must

00:27:29.719 --> 00:27:30.719
have a nice meal

00:27:30.719 --> 00:27:32.279
at this place tonight

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:38.160
so Dad and Jianqi can feel relieved.

00:27:39.239 --> 00:27:40.079
Let's eat.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.960
Who is it at this time?

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.640
Do you think
it's someone from the court?

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:48.239
Let me take a look.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.680
Be careful.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.200
Both of you are...

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.279
This is Feng's son.

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:34.920
That's impossible!

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.140
(Medical Certificate of Birth)

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.780
(Medical Certificate of Birth)

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.980
(Medical Certificate of Birth)

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:07.799
That's impossible.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.680
My dad will never have a son outside.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.640
You must be here to cause trouble.
Get out!

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:17.880
You are being rude.

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:21.079
I remember Feng used to tell me

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.999
that his daughter was outstanding.

00:29:22.999 --> 00:29:23.920
Shut up!

00:29:23.999 --> 00:29:24.960
Meiqi.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.519
Mingzhu,

00:29:32.239 --> 00:29:35.519
bring Meiqi and the child outside.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:36.759
Mom.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.360
Go.

00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:43.400
Qi,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.799
go out and play with your sister.

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.360
Go.

00:29:53.479 --> 00:29:54.079
Let's go.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.319
Sit.

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:18.799
Hello, Mrs. Feng.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.400
I am Ding Hong.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.719
I won't beat around the bush.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.680
I came here

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.719
to tell you

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.479
that we should have a part

00:30:28.079 --> 00:30:29.160
of Feng's inheritance.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440
Feng is dead.

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:35.759
He left nothing behind

00:30:35.999 --> 00:30:37.160
besides his debt.

00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:41.319
The court will take this house tomorrow.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.759
A family like ours.

00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:52.319
With Feng doing business outside
all the time,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.799
besides you, Ding Hong,

00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:57.840
there might also be a Li Hong,
Wang Hong, or Cai Hong.

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:00.440
Which mistress are you?

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.600
The third?

00:31:04.239 --> 00:31:06.400
The fourth, fifth, or sixth?

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.239
Mrs. Feng, you are pitiful.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.479
Are you used to being cheated on?

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.360
It's normal.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.719
What do you think?

00:31:16.719 --> 00:31:17.640
It's fine.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.600
I'm sure you are very angry

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:21.719
and sad.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.920
I understand.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.519
I don't mind

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:25.719
no matter what you say.

00:31:26.479 --> 00:31:28.319
Later, we will go
through legal proceedings

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:29.440
if need be.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.279
For the child,

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:34.160
I will definitely
fight for Feng's inheritance.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.719
Go ahead.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.999
You can also investigate

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.680
and see

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.400
what inheritance Feng has

00:31:43.759 --> 00:31:45.200
for you to fight for.

00:31:48.759 --> 00:31:49.880
Feng is dead.

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:54.039
How many women and children

00:31:54.039 --> 00:31:55.519
he had out there

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.279
is none of our business.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.079
You are still young.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.719
Live a good life with your child
in the future.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.279
Did Feng

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.120
give you this bracelet?

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.400
It's fake.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.239
There's only one bracelet
in the Feng family.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.759
My mother-in-law gave it to me

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.239
and I gave it
to my daughter-in-law, Shen Mingzhu.

00:32:37.719 --> 00:32:39.319
You are young after all.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.680
You gave birth to a son
without getting married.

00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:45.559
How gullible.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.559
That's not necessary.

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.120
Qi, let's go.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.039
Meiqi,

00:33:35.239 --> 00:33:36.360
this soup is delicious.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.400
Come.

00:33:45.319 --> 00:33:46.079
Wait!

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:54.719
Is your mother-in-law fine?

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.519
I rushed out to tell you

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.160
that not only did my father-in-law
not leave any assets behind,

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.559
but he even has a lot of debt.

00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:02.840
If you had come a day later,

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.960
you'd see

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.519
the court's seal on the door.

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:07.479
Is that so?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.260
I'm sure you haven't gone
to the factory yet.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.199
If you don't believe me,
go to the factory

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.199
and you'll understand.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.170
Since he didn't leave anything behind,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.039
let's not keep in touch.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.800
Otherwise, everyone will be sad.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.400
Mom.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.119
Don't worry.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.679
I don't think they will come again.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.039
It's fine.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.280
Eat. Hurry.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.400
Eat.

00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:48.720
Meiqi,

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.079
eat.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.880
I wonder

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.760
how my cooking is now.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.920
It's very salty.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.750
Let me tell you something about Meiqi.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.800
When we first

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.159
bought this house,

00:35:06.999 --> 00:35:08.039
you were abroad.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.360
You were so much trouble.

00:35:10.039 --> 00:35:11.599
You sent me pictures every day

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.159
and said you wanted the room to be pink

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.400
and the blankets

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.920
must be the same as the wall.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.079
You were so much trouble.

00:35:20.479 --> 00:35:21.360
Let me tell you.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.599
Your dad loves you a lot.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.639
It's true.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.400
He didn't sleep during the afternoon

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.840
and insisted on going
to the building materials shop with me

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.400
because my aesthetic is bad.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.479
Is my aesthetic sense bad?

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.360
I am He Lihua.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.599
How can my sense be bad?

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:35.519
Seriously.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.360
However, your dad really loves you.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.920
Also, Mingzhu,

00:35:40.519 --> 00:35:43.079
do you know that crib?

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.519
The baby's crib?

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.599
He was old

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:48.240
but he carried it back himself.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.039
I didn't expect that.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.039
That's right.

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:55.400
The bracelet

00:35:56.119 --> 00:35:58.280
is a family heirloom of the Feng family.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.039
You must wear it.

00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:01.079
It protects you.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.320
All right.

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:07.039
This is quite good.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.400
I... I think...

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.240
In the past, I thought

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.440
life was long

00:36:16.039 --> 00:36:17.599
and there was a lot of time.

00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:19.760
I didn't expect

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.119
all the time
to pass in the blink of an eye.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.800
I felt all those days I lived

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:30.079
were fake.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.519
Mom,

00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:34.240
it's fine.

00:36:35.599 --> 00:36:37.519
In the future, we'll live on.

00:36:37.519 --> 00:36:39.840
Of course. We must live a good life.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.039
I'm so tired.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.519
I'm so tired.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.039
Both of you, eat.

00:36:52.039 --> 00:36:53.559
I want to take a break.

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:54.400
Just a short break.

00:36:55.159 --> 00:36:56.920
Eat well.

00:36:57.079 --> 00:36:58.320
Mom, let me accompany you.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.720
No.

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:02.240
I'm just taking a break.

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:03.800
It's fine.

00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:33.559
Mom, I'm very scared.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.639
Mom, I'm very scared.

00:37:38.479 --> 00:37:39.119
Don't be scared.

Let's go.

don't sleep here.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.840
Let's go sleep on the bed, all right?

00:38:14.999 --> 00:38:15.639

00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.840
It'll be fine.

You are...

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.240
Is it here?

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.400
Where's the operation?

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.039
Mingzhu.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.400
Minghui.

00:39:17.999 --> 00:39:18.720
Are you all right?

00:39:23.159 --> 00:39:23.479
Mom.

00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:23.960
It's fine.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:24.679
It'll be fine.

00:39:24.679 --> 00:39:25.270
Don't be scared.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.599
We are here.

00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:35.679
How is it, Doctor?

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.880
The operation was a success.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.999
But the patient
is still in a critical condition.

00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:40.880
She needs to be observed in the ICU.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.180
I need a family member
to complete the necessary procedures.

00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:43.800
I'll go.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.599
Minghui, get my bag for me.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:46.800
Here you go.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.079
Accompany Mom and Dad for me.

00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:48.999
Slow down.

Yes. I am He Lihua's family member.

What is it?

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.360
The patient's platelet count is only 19.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.760
We recommend
administering the human albumin.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.119
However, this is self-paid.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.559
How much is it?

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.800
Sure. We'll proceed.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.119
Yes. I know we are owing money.

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:12.639
