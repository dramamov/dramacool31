about this, did he?

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.940
What are you worried about?

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.520
Worried that Zhong Chunji
will turn on you?

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.200
Or worried that your status as a heroine

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.260
will go up in smoke?

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.310
You're anxious and restless.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.600
You're eager

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.530
to hurry back to the Sword Alliance

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.010
to fight for something for yourself.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.380
Godfather,
you truly are extraordinarily wise.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.480
If we expose now

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.120
that Zhong Chunji

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.360
is a fake princess,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.530
there's still room to turn things around.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.170
Attempts that are bound to fail

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.070
are not worth making.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.510
Thanks to Tang Lici,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.720
I now understand people

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.120
far better than before.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.940
Before I understood human nature,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.600
I thought a single tattoo

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.630
could turn someone

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.870
with an unknown background

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.270
into a princess,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.080
my pawn.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.720
But now I understand—

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.200
they never cared whether the princess

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200
was real or fake.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.760
They just needed someone to play the part

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.320
to strengthen their power.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.640
I thought I fooled the world,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.120
yet it turns out

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.280
I was the one being fooled.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.770
People lie

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.840
and play dumb.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.270
That is exactly

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.690
what makes the human heart so treacherous.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.030
Godfather,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.200
I want to ask you for something.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.560
What is it?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.240
Freedom.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.240
You are my most prized student.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.100
If I had freedom,

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.130
I would certainly grant it to you.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.080
However,

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.290
a puppet's entire life

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.900
can never escape the pull of its strings.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.890
As long as the master lives,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.220
how can there be freedom?

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.630
Yique Yinyang said he needs us.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.360
The bronze tree's roots
spread across the entire Shenzhou.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.440
Tang Lici only destroyed

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.600
its trunk.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.800
If...

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.880
the bronze tree can be restarted

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.510
and it can draw in the power
of all Shenzhou,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.640
it could be revived.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.530
By then,

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.370
he will be waiting for us
in the Reincarnation Sea.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.750
The Reincarnation Sea?

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.030
The place where Yique Yinyang died?

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.960
Why would he be there?

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.910
A puppet...

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.100
doesn't need to know that much.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.790
Finally,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.270
it's done.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.750
As long as I return
to the Reincarnation Sea,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.140
where the Time Crack is located,

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.050
[In Memory of My Best friend, Chi Yun]
[In Memory of My Old friend, Liu Yan]

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.270
[In Memory of My Master and Friend,
Shao Yanping]

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.200
and activate it,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.320
you

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.900
will all be able to come back.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.200
You should be called

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.450
the Calamity-Free Cosmos.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.080
This...

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.210
is the Reincarnation Sea.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.340
It is said to be forged

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.870
from all the suffering of this world

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.200
that the Ancient Emperor collected.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.910
Meanwhile,

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.080
it is the point where space and time

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.280
are at their weakest.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.890
Ordinary people

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.690
cannot enter at all.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.070
And Ye Mo

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.960
will only appear here.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.670
It's time.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.570
Master told me

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:11.840
that person

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.740
has already arrived
at the Reincarnation Sea.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.830
This is the moment.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.950
Activate the bronze tree's power
of absorption.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.240
The Black Tuli
we've been accumulating for 20 years

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.120
will finally serve its purpose.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.600
What is that?

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.530
This is the sign of the world's end.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.090
Look over there!

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.460
That's Yique Yinyang!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.600
What should we do now?

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.320
[Reincarnation Sea]

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.290
Yes.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.360
You're here.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.420
The stolen crystal

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.280
and the poisoned corpses
at West Wind Garden—

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.110
this was

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.800
all part of your plan.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.440
Xifang Tao still has allies
in the Sword Alliance.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.630
Your staying here is the only way

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.110
to prevent internal chaos.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.680
Your goal

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.190
was to lure me here.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.130
It seems that...

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.050
what the mural records

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.750
is not the past,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.890
but the future.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.590
You and I...

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.320
will meet here.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.720
So it really is you.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.790
The Sword Alliance is heavily guarded.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.260
How did the fake rescue letter
forged by Xifang Tao

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.860
get out of the Sword Alliance

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.510
and reach the disciples
of Huoyun Fortress?

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.100
I mentioned Liuyan's hiding place

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.900
only to Master Shao.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.130
But I didn't realize

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.640
you were there

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.190
at the time.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.920
When I rescued Liu Yan,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.950
I blocked almost every killing strike—

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.510
except yours,

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.510
the one strike from you
when you came to help.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.000
Go now!

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.600
Your work wasn't flawless;

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.980
it was actually full of holes.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.960
Yet I refused

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.500
to suspect you.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.630
Stone.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.670
Master,

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:57.830
how could something fake

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.350
fool your eyes?

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.090
I am indeed Stone,

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.780
but I am also Ye Mo.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.240
Both of them

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.730
are the real me.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.080
So,

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.710
you look exactly like him.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.390
Because...

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.250
he is my puppet.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.720
Setting a trap
and having Ghostly Peony possess my body

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.240
was only your first move.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.440
And making me become Fang Zhou to Stone,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.720
teaching you that human nature
is inherently good

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.910
and letting you experience emotions

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.440
and awaken as Ye Mo—

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.180
that was your backup plan.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.860
Master, you're right.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.970
Have a seat.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.790
We still have a long way to go.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.390
We have time to talk.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.320
You know what, Master?

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.180
I truly admire you
from the bottom of my heart.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.190
If

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.430
I stay as your disciple a little longer,

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.190
perhaps

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.859
I will no longer want

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.359
to become Ye Mo again.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.329
What are you thinking about, Master?

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:21.589
I'm wondering...

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.690
if someone with the god‑like power

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.200
of Yique Yinyang

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.980
were to use it for good,

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.480
what would this world become?

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.070
This is the question

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.600
Fang Zhou had been pondering all along.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.480
When he met me at Mount Li,

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.330
he saw my golden eyes and forehead mark.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.690
At that time,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:45.720
he wasn't sure

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.320
whether I was Yique Yinyang,

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.030
yet he still

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.200
brought me back to Zhoudi Tower

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.830
♪ No one passes, and flowers fall ♪

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.440
and raised me with the belief

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.330
♪ It's just like a trip coming and going ♪

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.590
that people are good at heart from birth.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.160
♪ Guests at door, no joy or grief ♪

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.260
It was also because of his selfless love

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.040
♪ Bodhi sprouts between the brows ♪

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.370
that this world

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:03.680
came to have Tang Lici.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.800
♪ I've come, yet you're not here ♪

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.320
That...

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.700
♪ Only wind and rain ♪

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.400
was the second choice he gave me.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.040
♪ Mountain path ends,
and soft wind blows ♪

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.420
♪ Clouds gone, night quiet,
birds sing alone ♪

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.050
Since

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.160
♪ On the endless cold night ♪

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:19.920
you still call me Master,

This is the truth of the world.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.880
What does it have to do with my choices?

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:50.630
What you're saying

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.880
is not the reason

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.810
you chose to become Yique Yinyang.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.960
The fate of the two of us was determined

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.560
from the moment we were born.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.000
We are the same kind.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.070
No matter how different

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.070
the paths we took,

we will always

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.120
meet the same end.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.340
Master,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.800
you are good in every way—

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.870
except that you are too naive.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.440
So naive that even now

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.860
you still hold hope about human nature.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.850
The goodness you pursue

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.210
is nothing

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.210
but an illusion.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.030
If you know what I, your disciple,

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.110
have done,

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.920
will you

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.020
still be so naive?

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.510
Let me guess

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.880
what you intend to do.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.560
You merged
Ghostly Peony's Heaven-Changing Scripture

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.800
into the bronze tree,

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.370
using it to operate the Black Tuli

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.370
as nourishment for the bronze tree,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.310
driving it to grow toward the Void.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.370
What you truly want

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.140
is to use the bronze tree as a medium

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.770
to draw the power of Shenzhou

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.750
and link the bronze tree

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.920
to the Xuan Tree above the Void,

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.260
allowing the Tianren Realm

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.830
to reappear.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.110
Tang Lici,

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.950
you can't stop
the bronze tree from growing.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.920
Dream on.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.000
Come on.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.640
It's time

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.850
to complete the mission of a puppet.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.170
Master, you're so clever.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.830
You've figured out

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.110
everything I've done.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.400
The spiritual energy above the Void
has dried up.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.160
Our people suffer

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.960
from the Tianren Five Declines.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.680
That's why they sent me

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.750
to Shenzhou.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.630
All of it was for this very day.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.930
To end the Tianren Five Declines,

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.610
you are willing to sacrifice
the whole Shenzhou.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.780
The mistakes made by

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.800
the Tianren Realm itself back then—

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.480
you now want the living beings

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.110
of Shenzhou to pay for them.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:33.650
Dream on!

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.370
I'm using this filthy and wicked world

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.940
to bring
the Tianren Realm back to Shenzhou,

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.200
freeing them
from the cycle of life and death

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.670
and granting them immortality.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:52.500
By then,

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.550
you can even

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.750
bring your friend back to life,

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.160
and you can have me continue

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.890
being your obedient disciple.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:00.690
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.120
There is indeed much evil in this world,

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.240
but there are also many things

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.300
worth cherishing.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.280
Every life is free

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.440
and should not be sacrificed

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.970
for someone else's desire.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.400
Kindness is human nature.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.550
Even though human nature is fragile

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.830
and love and hate are ever‑changing,

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.200
given even one chance,

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.790
no one would willingly
sink into eternal darkness

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.550
and become a puppet

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.880
who shares their master's joy and sorrow.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.270
Everyone

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.070
deserves a chance

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.270
to start anew.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.970
You always wear that bracelet.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.750
Perhaps there's still goodness in you.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.020
Master Puzhu,

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.100
what's inside these beads

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720
is deadly poison—

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.480
cinnabar.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.920
It can be poison,

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.790
but it can also be medicine.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.270
It all depends

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.290
on a single thought in you.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.590
Light Technique—

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.010
Stars Scattered Across the Sky.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.800
Didn't you want freedom?

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.740
Becoming a part of the bronze tree—

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.430
that is freedom.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.840
Master,

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.500
this is the final move.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.110
This is

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.120
true freedom.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.040
The Peach of Three Hues—

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.890
Perish Together.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.080
So...

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.070
this is what it feels like.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.680
I'll call you Little Puppet.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.440
You said just now

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.850
that you still want to be Stone.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.860
That means your conscience
hasn't completely gone.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.750
Let go of your hatred.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.580
Don't knock it down.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.160
Only by not knocking it down

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.930
can you truly claim it as yours.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.890
Master,

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.980
how could you forget everything?

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.170
Master, you have done no evil,

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.080
yet evil happened because of you.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.310
Everywhere you go, there is destruction.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.170
How are you any different from me?

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.070
I...

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.920
just want to live.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:05.440
Master,

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.680
now I'm grateful

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.860
that I wasn't swayed by your naivety

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.660
and didn't forget
the most important mission

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.790
I was born to fulfill.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.480
Master,

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.230
the time has come.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.640
Your coming here to fight me

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.200
was all part of my plan.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.440
We are both Holy Sons.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:36.440
I need two streams of power

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.050
from the Tianren Realm to merge

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.860
in order to activate the bronze tree

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.980
to draw out the Xuan Tree above the Void,

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.590
and bring the Tianren Realm
back into the world.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:45.680
What I want is not just

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.940
the power of Shenzhou.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.720
What I want

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.940
is your power.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.480
The bronze tree has already merged with me

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.400
completely.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:52.910
All things are me,

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.430
and I am all things.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.590
Now the entire Shenzhou

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.480
will be mine.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:58.680
Master,

00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.640
come on.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.830
Witness the return of the Tianren Realm

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.000
to Shenzhou with me.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.920
Run!

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.110
Everything is over.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.200
Yes.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.190
It's over.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.650
I always thought

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.250
that if I were persistent enough,

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.480
strong enough,

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.510
I could protect everything I cherish.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.000
But in the end,

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.920
I gradually realized...

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.410
that I couldn't.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:01.930
Let's go!

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:03.630
To Sword King City!

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.400
I can't let you go.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.480
Sand City was so beautiful.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.030
He had so much fun.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.230
When it was time to leave,

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.000
he was reluctant to leave.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.170
Because Sand City doesn't belong to him.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:16.770
He couldn't take it with him.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.750
Mr. Tang,

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.160
you've lost.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.360
I haven't finished

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.110
what I want to do yet.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.790
I'm useless.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.610
What are you doing?

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.240
This half of the Rebirth Scroll

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.570
was yours to begin with.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.050
I'm just returning it
to its rightful owner.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:49.200
No!

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:50.510
Stop it now!

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.000
The transfer has already started.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.110
If we stop now,

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.590
wouldn't I end up

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:56.750
like Fang Zhou?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.200
You know that better than I do.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:58.680
No...

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.510
No!

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.880
With this half of the Rebirth Scroll,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.070
at least your life

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.070
can be preserved.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.590
At least it gives me time

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.000
to find a way to save you!

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.590
But if you...

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.430
you give it back to me now,

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.440
then…

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.240
No!

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.350
Liu Yan,

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.400
you can't do this.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.510
Lici,

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.210
I have the body
of the Ten Thousand Curse Bugs.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.880
I can use my own body

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.560
to cultivate medicinal primers

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.080
to make Blood Ghost Pills.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.160
That's why Ghostly Peony

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.760
destroyed all my meridians.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.310
But...

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.420
there is still one he doesn't know about—

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.070
my heart meridian.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.000
Lici,

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.160
I've lost in this life.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.030
Lost completely.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.440
That's why you must win.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.030
Win back everything...

00:31:58.790 --> 00:31:59.960
including my share.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.750
I used to

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.690
never want to lose anything

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.480
or let anything go.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.250
I wanted to hold on to everyone

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.850
and change every ending.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.610
But the more I tried to grasp,

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.830
the more I lost.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.220
So...

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.790
it's better to let go.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.400
Life and death happen in an instant;

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.650
all things return to their origin.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.790
To overturn heaven and earth

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.550
is to be reborn.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.180
Rebirth Scroll—

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.960
reincarnation.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.830
A complete Rebirth Scroll?

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:07.770
How is that possible?

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.970
When did you...

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.720
When you thought

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.650
you had seriously injured Liu Yan.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.850
When you believed
you had controlled everything

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.980
and victory was already in your grasp.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.500
The splendor of the mortal world

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.160
is as fleeting as morning dew—

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.500
only when it's lost

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.670
do we feel regret and sorrow.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:39.870
Love and hate

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.990
shift in an instant.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.900
Only possession

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.810
can leave a lasting mark on the heart.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.540
Then I'll teach you
the Three Character Classic.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.750
Man...

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.000

birth.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.110
If everything in this world

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.880
became an unchanging eternity,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.270
it would no longer be worth remembering,

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.940
let alone cherishing.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.550

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.280
all of this—

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.719
you're just...

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.080

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:43.210

stop following me.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.110
I'm not your wife.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.210
Well,

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.110
our parents arranged this marriage,

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.400
and the matchmaker confirmed it.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.000
We are engaged to each other.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:14.410
How are you not my wife?

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.010
Bai Suche!

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:19.200
Hey, buddy,

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:20.880
what are you laughing at?

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.340
I have a wife and you don't.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:25.520
Honey, wait for me!

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:28.170
Honey!

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.290
The Earth Sword!

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.000
You've been out for half a year

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.320
and haven't improved at all.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.450
You can't even pull out an Earth Sword.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.810
Is it difficult?

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.290
Is this really so hard?

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.240
Young Lord!

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:48.070
What is it?

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.000
We should head back to Sword King City,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.160
or the City Lord will start worrying.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:50.560
Got it.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.960
Such a show-off.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.440
Senior,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.300
I pulled it out!

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.060
Brother?

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:38.750
Brother?

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:41.620
Let's go.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.150
Master Tianxuan

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.010
is waiting to play chess with you.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:06.750
Master!

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.960
I'm back!

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:09.550
Chunji,

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.490
you're back?

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:15.630
Is everything all right?

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:17.570
Of course.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
It's said

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:26.550
that at the foot of Mount Li,

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.070
there lived a white fox

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.360
who had been startling the villagers.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.760
In Zhoudi Tower,
there was a man of great kindness

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.840
who moved it with compassion

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.480
and taught it music.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.430
And so, 7 years passed.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.610
Little Fox.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.790
One day, clouds rose and mist gathered,

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.140
and a white dragon soared into the sky.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.850
Four years later,

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.720
when calamity struck the world,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.280
the fox-dragon,
remembering the kindness it once received,

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.840
offered itself as the way

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.760
and reversed the fate of heaven and earth.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.560
Then it vanished among the common people.
