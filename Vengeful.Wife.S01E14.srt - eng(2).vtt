00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.039
Today,

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.780
I'll announce something important.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.939
Let's see what this fool

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.939
is up to today.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:59.979
Keep it low-key.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.140
The arrogant

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:02.340
will meet their fate.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.420
From today onwards,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.579
remove all projects

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:07.900
and traces

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:11.060
of the Lins from Jiuyao Group.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:12.219
Moreover,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.180
last night I gathered the media

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:16.500
and announced this matter.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.859
This...

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:18.620
How can he do this?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:19.879
This won't do.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.560
Mr. Ye,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.659
Ms. Lin is your wife.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.480
As she's blind now,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.739
so she's

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.459
lost her value to you.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:28.900
There has

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.500
to be a bottom line, right?

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.379
Indeed,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.700
you even gathered the media

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.980
and announced this.

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.159
You want to show others

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.739
how ruthless the core

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:40.299
of Jiuyao Group is?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.140
What you're saying

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:44.180
makes sense.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.579
It was painful for me

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.019
to make this decision.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.859
But for the group's future,

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:51.900
I must do this

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.459
and act quickly.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:54.680
Fine,

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.180
let's hear

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.799
why you're being heartless.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.560
Let's see how you'll justify it.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.299
(Lin Xia,)

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.860
(former CEO of Jiuyao Group,)

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.460
(is suspected of killing Lin Na,)

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.219
(former CFO of Jiuyao Group.)

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.620
(Fled in fear of punishment,)

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.860
(she is wanted citywide.)

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:16.780
This is impossible.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.620
I never thought she was like this.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.539
She did such a thing.

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.360
Appearances can be deceiving.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.900
Exactly.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.500
Fortunately,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.219
she's no longer in the group's

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.180
leadership core.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:29.280
Otherwise,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.479
our stocks would have taken a hit.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.500
This time,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.939
thanks to Mr. Ye

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.419
for announcing this in advance.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:36.819
Mr. Ye,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.180
you've saved the group again.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:40.319
Yes.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.819
Right.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:42.099
Now,

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.860
you know his decision

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.180
is wise, right?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.300
Mr. Ye,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.740
I was blind

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.020
to your wisdom

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.460
and your worth.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.580
Here I am

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.300
to offer my apologies.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:55.460
I believe

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:56.939
that under your leadership,

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:57.979
our group

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:58.639
will

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.099
reach new heights.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.360
It will.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.039
Yes.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.620
Mr. Wang,

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.219
you flatter me.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.819
As a member of Jiuyao,

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.979
I must prioritize Jiuyao.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.539
In the days to come,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.539
let us work together

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.460
to create brilliance.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.379
Alright.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.539
(Clues)
Lin Xia suddenly regained sight

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.819
and escaped after a murder.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.020
This is unbelievable.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.659
She's been faking blindness.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.060
Every action a person takes

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.180
presents

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.979
a different state

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.099
to achieve

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.259
the greatest advantage

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:40.039
to survive

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.860
in a specific context.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.500
If by faking blindness,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.979
she can avoid danger,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.379
of course she'll do it.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:50.500
She's self-protecting.

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:51.860
Or perhaps

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.979
she's waiting for a chance.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:54.379
Qiao,

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.460
take a team

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.280
later

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:57.340
to visit Lin Xia's

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.180
attending physician

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.659
to get full details.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.360
Okay.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:02.180
Master,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.379
you're something.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.632
No trace of Bai Cha
in the neighboring city.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.780
Cheng Nuo's lying.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.939
Your gut was right.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.379
The key figure

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.580
in both cases

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:13.180
is him.

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:16.500
Sirs,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.339
Mr. Cheng hasn't appeared today.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.420
His phone's unreachable.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.379
He missed two scheduled surgeries.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.920
This is worrying!

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:27.339
Did this happen before?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.139
Never.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.500
He is meticulous

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.620
and highly responsible.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.300
He's never delayed any surgery.

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:33.379
Do you know

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:34.139
his home address?

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.980
Yes.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.040
We sent people there,

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.019
but nobody's present.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.379
Well.

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:43.779
If things go wrong,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.420
call me immediately.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.220
Okay.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.819
Thank you.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.620
Could I take a look around?

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:57.620
Of course.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.980
This way, please.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.459
Young lady.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.839
What's stored inside here?

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.019
Some medications need refrigeration.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.259
May I inspect inside?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.779
Mr. Cheng ordered that

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:31.759
without his permission,

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.040
no one enters.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:35.259
We suspect Cheng Nuo

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.579
is related to a murder.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.579
We need to force

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.500
the door open now.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:39.300
Cooperate.

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:40.459
Fine.

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:41.680
I'll get the keys.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.379
What's inside?

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.699
A freezer containing

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:02.819
medical supplies.

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:16.360
Master,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.819
nothing here!

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.220
A strand of hair.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.939
A corpse

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.240
was stored here?

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.199
Notify the testing center

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.279
to collect samples

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:36.899
and run a genetic comparison

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:38.220
with Bai Cha's blood found

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.019
under the cliff.

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.959
Yes.

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:44.360
Young lady.

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:45.540
Please show me

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:46.899
your CCTV footage.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.819
They're malfunctioned recently.

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:50.360
Mr. Cheng never asked to repair.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.139
My beautiful CEO,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.220
awake at last?

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.019
I dislike

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:21.620
your defiant attitude.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.300
Think you're the Lin family heiress?

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.959
Hmm?

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:28.300
Still rebellious?

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.180
What?

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.480
Feel bad?

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:44.019
Come here.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.060
Unchain this door.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:54.720
Now,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.040
get out.

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:58.420
Crawl out like a dog!

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:01.660
Refusing, huh?

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:03.800
Out!

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.139
Lin Xia,

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:13.019
you have one chance today.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.399
Beg me and I'll

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.519
release you.

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:16.139
Okay?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.959
Refusing to beg?

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:19.720
Good.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.360
Come on.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.279
Give it to me.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.360
Scream!

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:26.980
Keep screaming!

00:08:29.899 --> 00:08:31.180
You can really take it.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.240
The high and mighty.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320
The golden heiress.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.519
Now you're like a pet

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.399
lying on the ground.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.139
Fine.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:40.639
I've served your family

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:42.019
for all these years,

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:43.820
so I'll give you one last chance.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.860
Kneel

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.720
and beg me.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.840
If you beg me,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.480
I'll let you go today

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.720
to spare you some pain.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.919
Agree?

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.460
Oh, right.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.840
Show you something.

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:01.700
(Lin Xia,)

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.299
(former CEO of Jiuyao Group,)

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:05.139
(is suspected of killing Lin Na,)

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:06.639
(former CFO of Jiuyao Group.)

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:08.080
(Fled in fear of punishment,)

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.320
(she is wanted citywide.)

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:12.340
Well?

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.460
Doesn't it feel like

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:16.279
hopeless weakness?

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.799
Like the whole world

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:19.240
has abandoned you?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.879
Feeling helpless?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.779
If you're a man,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.360
kill me!

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.639
Pah!

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.500
Alright.

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:32.840
Lin Xia,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.440
getting you to yield

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.740
is so hard.

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:37.799
I gave you a chance today,

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:38.600
but you rejected it.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.679
Then don't blame me

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:41.919
for being ruthless.

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:44.360
Stop!

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:47.159
Dong.

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:48.620
Dong.

00:09:58.799 --> 00:09:59.639
Look at me.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:06.240
I said look at me!

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.120
Your eyes

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.320
make me sick.

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:16.139
Pah!

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.659
I treated you so well,

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:24.039
yet you betrayed me.

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:29.279
Never imagined

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.120
you're still

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.000
hiding behind your mask.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.960
How pathetic.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.620
I bowed my head

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:38.759
to your father,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.039
doted on you endlessly,

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:43.159
and respected every person

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:44.279
and matter in the group.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.279
And you?

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:47.039
Plotted to expose me,

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.000
ruin me at the meeting,

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.799
destroy my reputation,

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:51.799
and land me in prison!

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.440
Lin Xia,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.639
you heartless witch!

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.340
After all I've done for you!

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.159
You make me sick.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.840
You treated me well?

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.200
You treated me well,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.340
so hooked up with others before me?

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:10.200
What have you done?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.200
You killed my father.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.279
Murdered Lin Na.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.139
You're an animal.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:16.840
No,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.480
worse than an animal!

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.600
I should sell you to underground dens

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.440
for public use

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:29.840
and humiliation!

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:32.879
But now,

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:34.759
your face

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.000
disgusts me completely.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:41.340
You'd better kill me now.

00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:43.600
If I get one chance,

00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:48.419
I'll make you beg for death.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.440
I hate

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.240
your eyes.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:37.480
No!

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:38.519
No!
