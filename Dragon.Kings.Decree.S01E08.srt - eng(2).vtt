Haven't you been wanting
to leave the Feng family?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.180
Go.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:08.979
Don't ever come back.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.145
Feng Qingfeng...

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.379
what's that supposed to mean?

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:18.618
Qingyun,

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:19.498
hurry.

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.260
Get Zhilou back to the council hall.

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:23.419
What are you trying to say?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.458
Feng Qingfeng,

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.178
answer me!

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.018
Feng Qingfeng,

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.379
what do you mean by that?

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.259
Surround them!

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.339
Yes, sir!

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.860
I, Lenghou Ye,
head of the Lenghou family,

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.058
have come to offer congratulations!

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.180
You and your family aren't welcome here!

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:46.980
That's some attitude you've got.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.618
Do you honestly think someone

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.859
with your martial cultivation
can address me this way?

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.219
My martial cultivation
is indeed beneath yours.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.338
For years,

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.298
your family has
pushed mine around at every turn.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.059
I've put up with it

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.740
to keep my family safe.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.338
But I didn't expect you to keep pushing

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:05.979
and go this far!

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.618
Today,

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:08.578
no matter
where my cultivation level stands,

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.819
as long as I'm standing here...

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.260
I'm not backing down.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.540
Fine.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.819
I'll give you that chance.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.979
You can be the first

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.939
to join my son in the grave!

00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.259
You actually have four spiritual roots.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.699
You're good at hiding things,
you sly old schemer.

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:30.780
But even then,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.938
you're still no match for me.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.619
How about now?

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.900
Six spiritual roots?

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.420
You forced your spiritual roots awake.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.300
Win or lose,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.938
it'll kill you.

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.379
I don't need heaven-defying power.

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:52.178
Standing guard over the people I cherish

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:55.379
is the greatest purpose of my life.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.298
The sanctuary is
on the brink of life and death,

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:22.859
and you're here making a scene!

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.979
Guards,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.499
take Zhi

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.539
to the Tree of Life and seal him inside

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.219
to reflect on his actions.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.300
No one's allowed to treat his injuries.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.579
Shang,

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.300
your duty

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.939
is to follow
the Dragon King's Decree's prophecy,

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.379
inherit the Dragon King's throne,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.178
marry the Wujing Saintess,

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:03.659
and protect the sanctuary.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.780
Yet now,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.498
you first lost the sigil

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.340
because a human girl

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.860
saved your life,

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:12.340
then went

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.938
and married her in the mortal realm,

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.058
and even handed her the Icebound Sword!

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:18.100
You...

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.019
You've truly...

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:22.579
disappointed me.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:25.059
Father,

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.019
the sigil somehow formed a bond

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.659
with Feng Zhilou when the Yang poison

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.899
nearly killed me,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.339
and I haven't been able to remove it.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.859
I left her the Icebound Sword

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.539
upon returning to the sanctuary,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.499
all to safeguard the sigil.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.618
The sigil is your reverse scale.

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:43.019
If it can't be removed,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.779
it means you formed a blood oath
with that woman.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.378
Unless she dies
and her soul's destroyed,

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:48.899
the blood oath won't break,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.139
and the sigil won't return to you.

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:56.860
Father,

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:59.499
Zhilou saved my life.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.540
I can't repay kindness with betrayal,

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:03.340
and I won't leave her to die.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.540
So...

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:06.899
So, are you willing

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.100
to give up the sigil and abandon

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.938
your marriage to the Wujing Saintess,

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:14.100
all for a human girl
from the mortal realm?

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.698
Will you just stand by
while the sanctuary falls,

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:17.818
the Demons invade,

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:19.378
and the world burns?

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:20.499
Father,

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:23.298
I can't believe

00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:25.100
you'd pin the fate
of every living being...

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:28.979
on a single marriage.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.180
Do not talk back!

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.660
Father,

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.180
I'm only trying

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.939
to protect the sanctuary

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.340
and all living beings in my own way.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.740
Kill Feng Zhilou,

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:51.259
reclaim the sigil,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.740
and marry the Wujing Saintess.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.819
Those are the only choices

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:57.420
you have left.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.699
Father,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.939
Zhilou is
one of those countless lives, too.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.100
She's also the one who saved me!

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.379
Even without the sigil,

00:08:07.499 --> 00:08:09.138
I can still protect the sanctuary

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:10.780
and everyone in this world!

00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:34.579
Uncle Qingyun,

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.738
what's Feng Qingfeng trying to do?

00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:38.059
Silly child.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.979
All these years, your father's done
far more for you than you realize.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.459
He may seem strict,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.819
but it's only
to keep others from hurting you.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.620
When the Lenghou family
tried to come after you last time,

00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:54.618
he had to discipline you first,

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:57.140
so they wouldn't
take the chance to go too far.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.260
Qingyun, promise me,

00:09:04.499 --> 00:09:06.900
no matter what happens,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.018
you'll take good care

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:10.819
of Zhilou for me.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.179
Every time he scolds you,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.418
he feels awful about it afterward

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:15.138
and always has me
bring you soup and medicine.

00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:17.540
Who gave you the right
to use the family punishment?

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.979
I'm the head of the Feng family.

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:22.378
Do my words

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:24.099
mean nothing to you?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.018
You're born unable to cultivate,

00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:28.579
and yet you want
to leave the Feng family

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.339
to fight alongside the Dragons.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.939
Some people are born losers!

00:09:33.619 --> 00:09:34.258
Let's go!

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:35.018
Do you know

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:37.099
how guilty he feels every time he sees

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.699
you being called a loser?

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.219
Do you realize you're wrong

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.459
for bullying Zhilou?

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.459
He could only discipline Feng Yunqiao
in secret.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.299
Perhaps that's why

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.939
Yunqiao resents you.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.059
Mother.

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:51.579
Mother.

00:09:52.739 --> 00:09:54.258
Is that you?

00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:56.498
He wishes he could see your mother, too,

00:09:56.499 --> 00:09:58.420
but he's powerless.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.819
Your father was harsh and distant

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.738
only because he had no other way

00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:05.459
to protect you.

00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:09.739
He'd rather be the villain in your eyes,

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:12.219
but he's never forgotten

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:14.538
that he is your father

00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:16.579
and you are his daughter.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.979
My father...

00:10:31.419 --> 00:10:32.540
Father!

00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:36.699
Father!

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.459
Father!

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.219
Father, open the door!

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.819
Please come in here,

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.059
Father.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.620
Feng Qingfeng,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.540
I'll never oppose you again.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.900
Father!

00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:08.219
You're fueling this flame
with your own life to fight against me.

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:13.380
As the seventy-second head
of the Feng family,

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:18.459
I swear to protect it with my life!

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.739
Father!

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.579
Feng Qingfeng!

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:02.459
Mr. Feng.

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:29.418
(I let my pride get the better of me.)

00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:30.498
Mr. Feng.

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:31.939
(Without Shang)

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.939
(and the Dragons,)

00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:37.459
(I'm still the Feng Zhilou
who has nothing.)

00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:39.140
(This is who I am,)

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.540
(and the Feng family is the same.)

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.099
Feng Zhilou,

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.819
no one in your family

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:05.140
walks away alive today!

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.780
You survived?

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.260
Isn't that obvious?

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.380
Fear is finally kicking in.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.819
Isn't it a little late for that?

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.979
Without the Dragons' protection,

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.459
you and the Feng family

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.300
are nothing but dust to me!

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.260
Utterly insignificant!

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.699
Father.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.540
I will kill you!

00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:43.739
I won't let you...

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.620
hurt anyone in the Feng family...

00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:50.339
ever again.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.540
Do you really believe

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:54.620
a loser like you is fit to stop me?

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.140
My father never bowed to you,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.939
and I, Feng Zhilou,

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.020
won't either.

00:15:28.659 --> 00:15:30.180
Nine spiritual roots?

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.579
That's nine spiritual roots.

00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:35.819
Zhilou is the true martial prodigy!

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.219
Impossible.

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:39.020
Impossible!

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:45.540
This is all bluff!

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.699
Zhilou.

00:16:04.419 --> 00:16:06.579
The phoenix isn't born dazzling

00:16:06.659 --> 00:16:08.420
but will eventually soar.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.459
Prepare for your rebirth.
