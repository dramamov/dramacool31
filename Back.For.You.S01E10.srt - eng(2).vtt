00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.400
Su Ruo

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.560
Are you home?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.200
It's me, Yu Xingchen.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.760
Su Ruo isn't home.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.960
Hello.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.720
I'm Su Ruo's classmate.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.320
She hasn't come to class for days.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.600
Her classmates and teacher asked me
to check on her.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120
Is she okay?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.960
I already said,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.040
Su Ruo isn't home.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.680
I'll let her know when she's back.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.160
That's odd.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.920
Su Ruo isn't home.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.760
Then where did she go?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920
I'll beat you to death.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.160
I'm going to beat you to death.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.680
Beat you to death, beat you to death,
beat you to death.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.240
Beat you to death.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.560
Go die, go die, go die.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.320
Beat you to death, I'll beat you to death.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.680
I'm going to beat you to death.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.880
Beat you to death, beat you to death,
beat you to death.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.520
Come on, hit me.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.480
Hit me.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800
I can help you win.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.960
Let me ask you.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.040
Do you know who bullies Su Ruo?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.280
I do.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.640
He's a bad person.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.440
I hate him.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.440
Can you take me to him?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.560
I want to talk to him.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.360
No, no.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.360
I don't dare. He's really bad.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.280
He hits people.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.880
Then tell me where he lives.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.320
I'll go find him myself.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.760
No, no.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.880
You shouldn't go either.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.480
He's scary.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.120
He drags people home and beats them.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.040
He locks you up at home and beats you.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.200
Locked up and beaten at home.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.640
Are you saying Su Ruo was locked up
and beaten at home?

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.280
Su Ruo isn't home.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.600
This person always lives with Su Ruo.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.280
Keep hitting, hurry.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.720
Keep hitting, come on.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.760
Su Ruo's diary says she locked the door.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.880
Was it not the main door lock?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.840
Was it her room's lock?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.080
Is this person a family member?

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.160
Who is it?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.480
You're so annoying.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.040
You again?

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.800
I told you, Su Ruo isn't here.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.240
Sorry.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.440
Su Ruo said

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.960
that person likes to drink.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.720
The higher-ups gave orders.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.880
There was an incident on the rooftop,
it's closed.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.160
What are you trying to do?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.200
Su Ruo, are you there?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.120
She's not here.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.320
Who are you?

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.960
Su Ruo.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.040
You come to my house causing trouble.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.640
Su Ruo, are you home?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.280
Get out of my house!

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.840
Get out.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.080
What did you do to her?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.640
Get out.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.760
Yu Xingchen, you should go home first.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.320
I'm fine.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.080
Hurry up, get out now.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.560
I won't leave unless she comes out.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.080
Did he hit you?

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.680
Don't worry, I was just careless.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.720
Did you hear me?

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.400
I said don't interfere.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.200
Get out of my house now!

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.840
Yu Xingchen, you don't need to worry
about me.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.920
You should go first.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.240
I won't let you stay with this person.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.840
I'll take you away.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.280
I don't want to leave.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.680
Just go.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.480
I...

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.080
Yu Xingchen, let's go.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.600
I didn't know what she was thinking
back then.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.160
She stubbornly held my hand

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.800
and kept walking, never looking back.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.440
Like the youth we can never return to.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.360
Why did you let him hurt you?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.920
Why didn't you tell Teacher Jiang sooner?

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.080
Actually, Uncle didn't mean to.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.040
He just drank too much.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.920
He couldn't control himself.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.080
If he can't control himself, he shouldn't drink.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.480
You don't need to defend him
in this situation.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.000
Let me take you to the hospital, okay?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.960
You're the one who should get checked.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.520
Does it still hurt?

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.000
I'll tell the Class President
about your situation.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.760
Don't worry about Teacher Jiang either.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.760
If you'd told me earlier,

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.200
I could've helped you for sure.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.120
Every time I saw Uncle

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.600
come home with a bottle,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.440
I'd hide in my room.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.880
But he has a key.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.240
If he hits you again,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.760
you must call the police.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.960
Or tell a teacher.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.360
Uncle, fifteen years later,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.760
is a security guard at Jianshe Community.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.400
He has a tendency for alcohol abuse
and violence.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.840
And he has the rooftop key.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.160
So it seems

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.600
Su Ruo's death is connected to him.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.520
Su Ruo.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.840
Stay away from your uncle from now on.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.400
Even fifteen years later,
don't go near him.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.240
Okay?

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.320
Why are you talking about things
so far ahead?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.360
Because I don't want you to get hurt.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.760
Now or in the future.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.520
Don't go home tonight.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.880
Did you bring your ID card?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.400
No.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.600
It's at home.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.640
Can't go anywhere.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.720
Are your parents not home?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.040
They are.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.840
They're probably asleep.
I'll take you to my room.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.040
Something's off. I think I heard
a girl's voice.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.320
I think I heard it too.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.560
Yu Xingchen

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.120
Coming to your place this late

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.960
isn't really appropriate, right?

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.920
It's fine.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.920
They're all asleep.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.680
Let's keep it quiet.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.480
They won't hear us.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.600
So our son wants to stay here overnight?

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.240
No, I need to go check.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.760
Aren't you the one who always says

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.640
we should trust our son?

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.000
We should be open-minded parents.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.840
We don't know the situation yet.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.800
Let's keep watching for now.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.160
The elders aren't asleep yet.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.680
Yeah.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.200
Got thirsty at night,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.760
so I got up for some water.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.760
Is this your classmate

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.840
who came to visit you?

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.760
Mom, Dad.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.440
This is my classmate, Su Ruo.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.560
Hello, classmate.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.720
Hello, classmate.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.840
Classmate,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.160
this ointment

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.360
reduces swelling and bruising.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.880
You young people

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.880
recover quickly.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.520
You'll be fine in a day or two.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.960
That uncle was really harsh, huh?

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.240
So that's the situation.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.040
Su Ruo has nowhere to go tonight.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.840
I want her to stay at our place tonight.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.360
Uncle, Auntie,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.480
I'm really sorry for bothering you.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.320
It's no bother.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.120
Yu Xingchen, you sleep on the sofa.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.240
And your dog bed is a mess.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.440
How can a girl sleep there?

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.640
It's fine.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.280
Honey, honey!

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.400
Go tidy up quickly.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.000
Right, right.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.600
You don't just stand there.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.640
Go cut some fruit.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.160
Right, right.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.560
Let's go.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.400
Sorry to trouble you, Uncle, Auntie.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.960
No trouble at all.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.320
We'll get you some hot water.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.840
Take a bath and sleep well.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.080
Cut all this fruit into pieces.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.360
Girls have small mouths.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.360
Got it, got it.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.800
Make the bed later.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.440
Use our new bedding set for her.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.240
I know.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800
That's such a big plate.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.160
I can't finish it.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.600
And I'll get fat if I eat too much.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.360
Then I can't help you.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.320
My mom said I'm not allowed to eat.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320
Only you can eat it.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.480
If you don't eat, I'll have to feed you.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.320
What's wrong?

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.560
Is this melon really sour?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.320
Wasn't it supposed to be sweet?

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.960
Xingchen,

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.360
don't bother Su anymore.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.720
Go out and rest now.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.880
Okay.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.440
I'm leaving.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.800
Are you really sleeping on the sofa?

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.120
What else would I do?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.120
No, I mean,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.920
if you're not used to it, I'll switch with you.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.160
It's my own sofa,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.880
I'm used to sleeping on it.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.000
Why are you up so early?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.400
Yeah, get up quickly.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.040
Let's go for a morning run together.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.200
Then review some vocabulary.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.200
You go ahead, I want to sleep more.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.840
Get up, it's senior year, don't waste time.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.760
If you don't get up, I'll pull off your blanket.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.200
You dare?

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.480
I'm not wearing anything underneath.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.040
You...
