00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.400
Say it.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.200
Why did you come to someone else's home?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.360
Isn't this my dress?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.240
Your dress

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.760
fell onto my balcony.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.280
I climbed up to return it to you.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.360
You climbed through the window?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.000
That's so dangerous.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.360
It's not dangerous.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.840
You're not lying to me?

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.360
I'm not lying to you.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.760
I wouldn't lie to someone I like.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440
Even if you like someone,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.920
you can't just enter their home.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.120
Don't scare him.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.600
Thank you for bringing my dress.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.560
Don't do this again next time.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.640
It's too dangerous.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.400
If he's always been like this,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.040
he won't change even after fifteen years.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.400
Did I get my investigation all wrong before?

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.480
Why do you run away when you see me?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.520
If you chase me, I'll run.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.320
Even if you like someone again,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.520
don't climb over walls.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.680
It's a special time now.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.840
She's in danger.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.280
Someone is bullying her.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.000
Bullying?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.320
What do you mean?

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.680
Tell me.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.640
Who's bullying her?

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.560
Tell me.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.840
Don't pull me, don't pull me.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.480
Yu Xingchen.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.880
He fell by himself.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.960
Yu Xingchen, are you okay?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.640
Are you okay?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.080
Why am I here?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.920
It's getting late.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.600
My mom is calling me home for dinner.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.720
I'll head back now.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.200
Investigating again?

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.320
I want to check the footage from that day.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.080
Is that okay?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.320
Hello, Tang Song.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.760
Zhang Chuan was here on the day it happened.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.080
Is there a problem with him?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.080
Zhang Chuan's intellectual disability

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.160
is real, not faked.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.520
He's liked Su Ruo since high school.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.240
And he still does to this day.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.200
By the way,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.400
he climbed the balcony fifteen years ago

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.360
and entered Su Ruo's home.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.440
Even if he's liked Su Ruo for fifteen years,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.280
so what?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.280
Haven't you liked Su Ruo for fifteen years too?

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.200
The clues you mentioned

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.400
we already have them.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.960
If it's not your business, stop investigating.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.960
Su Ruo.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.720
I haven't contacted her in a long time.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.920
Why ask about this suddenly?

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.840
Tang Song is right.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.480
I've always liked her.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.600
I've never let go.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.800
Yu Xingchen.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.400
Brother.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.080
Nice to meet you.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.320
I'm Ning Jing.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.640
Your Meixian Ayi has a daughter

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.040
named Ning Jing.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.440
Sorry.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.560
I didn't have time to tidy up.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.840
Come on.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.840
From the looks of it,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.960
you never tidy up, do you?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.880
I kept calling you, but no one answered.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.160
So I thought I'd come check on you.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080
I was busy just now.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.640
I saw it was an unknown number,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.200
so I ignored it.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.120
Are you okay?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.600
You look distracted.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.600
I've had something unusual these days.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.920
So I just...

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.240
But it's fine.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.720
I like people with personality.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.000
It's just strange to be called "brother" suddenly.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.440
I'm not used to it.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.240
You'll get used to it.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.200
Do you support your mom marrying my dad?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.680
Yes.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.080
I wish them well.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.960
Do you oppose it?

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.640
I don't oppose it.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.720
It's their life, after all.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.360
A middle-aged researcher's fridge—

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.280
I've never seen one before.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880
Middle-aged man.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.600
Thank you.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.720
I just wanted to ask you one thing.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.640
How do you want me to address you?

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.440
Call me "brother"

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.480
or Yu Xingchen?

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.920
That's all you came for?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.080
What do you think?

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.520
Talking about our parents' assets before marriage—

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.240
That's really something.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.800
Many people come to my home

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.480
and open my fridge without asking.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.440
Maybe they think I look

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.760
harmless.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.840
Easygoing, maybe.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.200
So they think

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.680
invading my privacy is fine.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.200
But as you can see,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.440
I'm alone and have achieved nothing.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.000
So,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.600
people opening your fridge without asking

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.680
is pretty normal, right?

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.240
Just like some people enter your life

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.880
without warning.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.040
Brother, at your age,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.320
saying things like that

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.320
isn't poetic,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.880
it's pretentious.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.720
Really?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.440
I feel like I'm only eighteen this year.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.680
Young at heart.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.920
Good for you.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.720
Anyway,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.040
I'm glad to have a sister like you.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.720
I mean it.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.520
Then congratulations

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.760
on having a sister like me.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.280
So polite,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.680
even bringing gifts.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.360
What are you thinking?

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.720
Your mailbox downstairs wasn't locked.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.640
I saw it and brought your mail up for you.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.280
Just a friendly reminder—

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.520
lock your mailbox next time.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.240
Hui Ge.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.960
I just suddenly thought of our school days.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.000
You seem interested in time travel.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.120
You even studied a related field later.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.520
The book I translated was published recently.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.760
So I bought a copy for you.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.520
What is it?

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.920
Looks like you have ordinary worries.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.200
How did you know?

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.760
We haven't met in over ten years.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.400
We aren't exactly close.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.720
If you just wanted to thank me,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.000
I could've mailed you the book.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.440
A phone call would suffice.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.000
No need to come all this way.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.480
Go ahead.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.600
My time—

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.360
You know it too.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.000
Your time is valuable.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.000
It's about Su Ruo's unexpected death.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.360
We're all old classmates.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.440
I didn't see you at the memorial.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.360
That's not important.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.400
Let's get to the point.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.720
I heard the rooftop door was locked that day.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.640
The girl probably locked it herself.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.240
You saw the surveillance too, right?

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.560
The night Su Ruo had the accident,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.560
he stayed in that building all night.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.040
He showed up again last night.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.440
That's quite a coincidence.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.280
Zhang Chuan's intellectual disability

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.080
is definitely not an act.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.280
Yu Xingchen, let go of him.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.160
We all know about his condition.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.480
Based on what you just said,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.000
then Su Ruo's death

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.040
probably has little to do with Zhang Chuan.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.000
Why are you so sure?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.640
Because the rooftop was a locked room.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.520
You said it yourself.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.240
Only the guard has the key.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.280
That's right.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.960
But I've read many novels.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.000
Don't they all have similar locked room murder tricks?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.240
For example, making a key out of ice.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.480
Pour water into the lock, freeze it into a key.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.800
After locking the door,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.000
the ice melts and the key disappears.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.560
Or sticking tape on the lock.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.240
After closing the door, it can still be pushed open.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.400
But none of these methods work here.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.400
Making ice keys only works up north.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.840
The ice there is hard enough.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.120
But not here.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.000
And if you use tape,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.320
sure, you can push it from outside.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.040
But you can't lock it to create a locked room.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.720
Even if there's a perfect locked room method,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.280
do you think Zhang Chuan

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.720
with his intelligence level

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.040
could come up with it?

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.400
Don't be so down.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.920
I'm not good at comforting people.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.560
By the way—

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.760
I'm thinking of writing a novel lately.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.400
It's about parallel worlds.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.520
Isn't that your field of study?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:24.920
Yes.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.760
Because of the grandfather paradox.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.080
So parallel worlds exist.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.720
Here's the outline of my story.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.440
To be honest,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.200
the plot is pretty cliché.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.040
The tropes are all overused.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.160
The plot isn't important, the key is—

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.280
As a novel,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.080
it's too much entertainment.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.600
Not much literary value.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.320
When I was at Tsinghua,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.560
I also audited literature classes.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.960
Writing this kind of novel is pointless.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.640
The point of writing it is

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.000
just for my own amusement.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.440
I don't plan to publish it.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.320
Literature is all about the self.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.880
Fitzgerald,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.520
Kafka,

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.760
Yukio Mishima,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.360
Eileen Chang—

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.920
all are reflections of the self.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.480
If you want to find yourself,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.760
I suggest you read earlier writers.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.960
I just want to build, in my novel,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.720
a time travel system.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.720
Why does all this happen?

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.600
Do you get it?

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.360
Then you're the author.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.160
You're in charge.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.640
The author still needs to make sense.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.520
Now, audiences everywhere

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.000
love to dig for answers.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.320
Then use what we mentioned before—

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.480
the parallel world theory.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.960
Each time you go back in time,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.720
the world you were in before

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.480
becomes

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.960
a parallel world you've abandoned.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.120
When did I tell you that?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.320
You must've forgotten.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.480
And you enter

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.760
a newly created parallel world.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.240
Sometimes you're not like I imagined.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.240
In the new world,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.120
you start from the entry time point

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.760
and begin a new timeline.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.600
So you returned to this time point.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.920
That's how it works, see?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.280
Like my previous two times—

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.680
I mean the sections I wrote in my novel.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.800
Both departures were at 9 p.m.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.320
Both started from the rooftop.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.560
Arrival location:

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.880
First time, the classroom.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.360
Second time, the school corridor.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.040
Trigger reason unknown.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.480
Look.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.720
Doesn't this just prove my point?

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.200
Everything else is exactly the same.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.400
Even the time and place you depart each time

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.120
and the place you return to are always identical.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.200
The time, place, and even the method you use

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.120
are all through something like

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.080
a space-time rift.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.560
Can I take this as time travel?

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.760
Each time you travel,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.880
it's based on your current world,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.480
creating a parallel world.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.240
And the essence of these parallel worlds

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.560
is that they're all the same mirror image.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.840
It's like a game save file.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.720
Every time you load your progress,

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.520
you're continuing from the old save

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.040
and keep playing.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.680
At the same time, you create a new save.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.520
Anyway, what we know is

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.520
the time is the same,

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.160
the place is the same,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.040
and the method is the same.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.800
It feels like

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.320
a periodic Temporal Leap Motion.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.360
Can you speak Chinese?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.600
I can't really understand you.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.720
What I say doesn't matter.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.240
What I really want to know is,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.240
next time,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.320
at the same time and place,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.840
can you still use the same method

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.880
to go back again?
