00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.279
Dig.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.840
Hurry, dig.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:53.319
Are you sure it's here?

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:54.919
I'm sure. Absolutely.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.880
Right here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.799
Right here.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.200
Here.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:10.360
You dare mess with me?

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.480
This Japanese sir,

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:14.160
aren't these the turtle shells
you're looking for?

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.120
So many turtle shells,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.680
aren't they enough for you?

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:31.760
I'll make you pay for Yi Yi's life.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.919
I just won't tell you.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:44.319
You little bastard.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.080
Go to hell.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.199
That Luo Yurong refused to talk
no matter what.

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:51.239
And that bitch

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.680
kept us trapped all night for nothing.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.720
Both who knew where the oracle bones went
are dead.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.400
I've wasted so much time.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720
Where's his body?

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:02.760
The body?

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.520
Of course, chopped up and fed to fish.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.240
And you?

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.160
Are you ready?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.639
Mr. Luo is gone.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.600
Big Brother is gone too.

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.800
Who will protect me from now on?

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.199
Heaven sees what people do.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.080
This kid survived

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.960
because he did something remarkable.

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.360
What about A Gou?

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:40.600
No matter what,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.160
he still held his ground in the end.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.880
It's just a pity about Luo Yurong.

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:46.559
Yeah.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.919
You two are fools.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.839
For some worthless turtle shells,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.520
you risked your lives.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.800
Yi Yi.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:59.559
Dead.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.360
It's all my fault.

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.839
If I hadn't betrayed you,

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.800
maybe you would've escaped long ago.

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:07.639
If not for me,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.360
Not me,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.880
being so greedy.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.080
Yi Yi.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.600
Yi Yi.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.559
Yi Yi wouldn't have died.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.279
A Gou.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.479
But don't worry.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.119
I won't make the same mistake again.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.119
Where are the oracle bones?

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.440
I know.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.199
But that's the treasure

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.080
you protected with your lives.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.679
No one can take it away.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.559
Old Luo.

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.440
Old Luo.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.799
What's going on?

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.519
Didn't you collect A Gou's spirit aura?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.600
If it were that easy,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.959
I'd have finished long ago.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.239
Besides, things always get harder

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:48.239
at the very end.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.399
Your servant greets Prince.

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:53.480
What's wrong?

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.320
Prince.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.200
Prince Ning is passing through here.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.959
He wishes you and Miss He

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040
to join him for a talk.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.119
Greetings, Prince.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.480
Rise.

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:16.160
Xiao Wu,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.839
you've been away from the capital so long.

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:19.200
The Forbidden City

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.079
isn't as lively as it used to be.

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:22.279
Honestly,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.679
I, the Prince,

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:25.399
actually miss you.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:27.239
Of course.

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:28.720
Who else is like me,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.119
skilled in both pen and sword,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.519
loved by all?

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.359
I suppose this is

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.160
He Fuyi, Miss He?

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.799
Good.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.839
Come, sit with us.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.079
I heard

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.480
Miss He often has

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.359
a seven or eight-year-old girl with her.

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.920
So,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.720
she didn't come this time?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.679
Prince,

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:56.320
she's staying with relatives on the way.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.359
That's a shame.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.720
I really wanted to meet her.

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:04.760
Prince.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.839
Why did you suddenly come to this remote place?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.679
Lately,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.640
the Yellow River floods have been frequent.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.239
I, the Prince, am concerned.

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.760
So I came to see for myself.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.279
So those below

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:17.679
don't slack off.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.000
Prince, you serve the country and people

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.679
with tireless effort.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.720
You sly fox.

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:26.600
No wonder the Empress Dowager

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:27.760
likes him.

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:31.040
Even when I greeted her this time,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.720
she asked me

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:34.440
about his news.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:35.640
Really?

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.559
I really am popular.

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:38.959
But Xiao Wu,

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:40.519
now

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.320
you're not so well-behaved.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.239
Forgive me, Prince.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:48.720
Prince.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.799
Feel free to speak plainly.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.000
Don't scare him.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.559
Seems Miss He is quite straightforward.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.600
Prince,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.079
mainly,

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:03.040
I'm not good at beating around the bush.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.320
I just don't get it.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.200
All right.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.040
I'll do it for Miss He Fuyi's sake.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.200
Let me give you some advice.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.799
The Empress Dowager lately

00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:19.079
has not been feeling well.

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:20.399
But still,

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:22.679
she keeps worrying about your schedule.

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:24.880
She talks about you,

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:26.920
and also about Miss He Fuyi,

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:29.239
and the lamp she holds—

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.359
the Seven Stars Lamp.

00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:32.320
Prince.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.200
This lamp

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:36.119
is indeed with Miss He Fuyi.

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:37.880
Since that's the case,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.559
why have you been dragging your feet

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:40.640
instead of returning sooner?

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.519
It's not that I don't want to.

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.320
I simply can't.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.679
The lamp has a problem.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.160
I'm afraid to use it for the Empress Dowager.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.799
That's something new.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:53.640
Miss He Fuyi,

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:55.760
what do you say?

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.200
He's right.

00:07:57.799 --> 00:07:58.679
The lamp is broken.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.640
It's broken.

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.239
So that means,

00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:09.200
even if the Empress Dowager wants you,

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:09.839
and you aren't rushing back,

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:11.559
not eager to report back,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.440
aren't you afraid she'll blame you?

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.839
Even if she does,

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.200
we can't give her something broken.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.959
No.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.000
We still don't know how

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.320
to use the lamp exactly.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.359
That's true.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.559
Get up now.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.359
I also heard

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:42.039
Lan Hai Society rebels chased you.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.000
Is that true?

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.520
Yes.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.880
I was so mad I sent word to the palace.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.159
Later, I

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:50.719
will keep a close eye on this.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080
Thank you, Prince.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.080
There's another coffin under the tomb's coffin.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.520
Luo Yurong put the box of oracle bones

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.520
inside it.

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:12.919
Good.

00:09:13.599 --> 00:09:14.719
Glad you found them.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.280
I'll take the oracle bones

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.799
back to Master Li.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.000
He's an expert in this field.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.239
He won't let down Luo Yurong's

00:09:25.239 --> 00:09:26.599
sacrifice to protect them.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.119
Thank you, Prince.

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:31.119
For honoring Luo Yurong and A Gou's devotion.

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:37.799
Farewell, Prince.

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:40.599
First, I met the Prince.

00:09:40.599 --> 00:09:42.440
Then, the Royal Prince.

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:43.359
In this life,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.200
I've finally brought honor

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.039
to the Li family.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.119
Prince Ning came here on purpose

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:50.479
to expose the situation.

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:51.840
He wants us to join him.

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:53.200
But the Empress Dowager

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.520
keeps watching you.

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:56.039
It's never over.

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:58.679
Who knows what trouble will come next?

00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:00.479
It's like gods fighting,

00:10:00.479 --> 00:10:01.359
and mortals suffer.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.559
Logically speaking,

00:10:02.719 --> 00:10:04.880
whether it's the Empress Dowager or the Prince,

00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:06.400
I can't resist either.

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:08.200
I can only deal with things as they come.

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:11.559
Prince Ning is held back by her.

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:13.479
So he recruits us in secret.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.559
If the Empress Dowager

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:16.119
really has an accident,

00:10:16.359 --> 00:10:18.200
he'll go after the Seven Stars Lamp first.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.000
There's no way around it.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.400
The legend of the Seven Stars Life Lamp

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.520
is too tempting.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.559
We can't avoid it.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.119
We must quickly light up

00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:29.080
the Big Dipper Diagram in the lamp.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.359
To keep you safe first.

00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:35.320
And Shen Changfeng.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.760
We must find him quickly.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.840
Otherwise,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.200
I'll lose all my leads.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.679
Why did things suddenly get so urgent?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.679
It's as if

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:45.080
an invisible hand

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.239
has tangled everything together.

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:52.000
It started when you suddenly showed up

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.080
and shamelessly tagged along.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.159
Don't talk nonsense.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:58.159
Have some conscience.

00:10:58.159 --> 00:10:59.280
I'm not making things up.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.599
I've found you odd several times.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.359
This time, you must answer me.

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:05.039
At the execution ground in Shaoxing,

00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:06.719
wasn't our first meeting,

00:11:06.719 --> 00:11:07.520
right?

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:12.559
So it's true.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.119
Though I don't remember,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.159
you've saved me from harm twice.

00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:19.679
So I never hurt you before.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.080
I helped you, didn't I?

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.679
You wouldn't repay kindness with hatred.

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:29.239
But logically,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.840
if it's to repay a favor,

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:33.239
saving me twice is enough.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.640
To risk yourself again

00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:36.559
and get involved in this mess

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.280
caught between the Empress Dowager and the Prince,

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:41.520
is a bit much, isn't it?

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:49.359
Be careful.

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:55.599
Be careful.
