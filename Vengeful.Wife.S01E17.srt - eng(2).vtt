00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.500
Yufei,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.619
there's something

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:59.979
I need your help.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.420
Dong,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.219
as your woman,

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.180
I'll do anything you ask.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.900
I want you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.099
to seduce someone.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.239
Dong,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.900
what do you mean by this?

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:16.540
Hmm?

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.780
You refuse?

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:22.700
I could do it,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.060
but

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:25.700
you know

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.459
my heart belongs only to you.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:31.420
Once it's done,

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.879
you'll get your reward.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.959
If you put it that way,

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:37.079
I take offense.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.739
I need no rewards

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:40.000
to help you.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:42.540
I just want a small place

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.659
in your heart.

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:47.900
Here's

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:49.579
Cheng Nuo's profile.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.200
Make him betray Bai Cha.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.019
Expose his true color to her.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.099
Don't worry.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.500
When I make my move,

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.780
no man can resist.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.540
I'll have him wrapped around my finger

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.099
and be obedient completely.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.400
Really?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.379
I look forward to it.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:16.900
But for now...

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.919
Dong,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.900
let me

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.020
take good care of you.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.120
Who...

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:39.199
Who are you?

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.659
I've missed you so much.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.400
Let me take a good look at you.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.860
I was terrified!

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:50.580
Great you're safe.

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.020
That's great.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.780
Mom,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.180
what brings you here?

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.500
Trying to worry me to death?

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.659
Bai Cha went through such trauma,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.460
yet you didn't tell me.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.340
Mom,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.979
how did you find out?

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.139
If Mr. Luo hadn't

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.099
called me,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.460
I wouldn't know about her fall

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.379
or the miscarriage.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:17.500
Bai Cha,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.020
you've suffered so much.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.379
It's Cheng Nuo's fault.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.099
He failed to protect you.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:25.300
Mom,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.479
I'm fine.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.520
See?

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:28.819
I'm perfectly healthy.

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.979
Falling from that height

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.860
must've left some damage!

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.180
Mom,

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.780
are you planning

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.379
to stay long?

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.419
Absolutely.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.699
Bone injuries need three months to heal.

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:44.139
We'll both

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.099
look after Bai Cha

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.460
during this period.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.300
Understand?

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.500
Understood.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.259
Thanks, Mom.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:53.659
No need.

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:55.900
Silly girl.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.819
I just have

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:58.979
one request for you.

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:00.300
What is it?

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.419
Don't treat me as a stranger.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.099
If you're hurting,

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:07.139
sad,

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:07.979
or scared,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.539
tell me everything.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.979
If the sky falls,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.300
I'll hold it up for you.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.060
Hear me?

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.480
Good girl.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.819
This is

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:24.180
my life savings.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.300
Take it.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.740
Buy whatever you need.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.160
I can't accept this.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.259
I told you

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.860
not to treat me as a stranger.

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:33.199
There's not much in this account.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.579
Just take it as a token of affection.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.019
Accept it.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.220
Then...

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.980
Then just take it.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.500
Alright.

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:44.639
I see.

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:51.579
Why

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.379
are you crying again?

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.300
Nothing.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.740
She must be

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:57.980
made of water.

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:02.500
Cheng Nuo,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.019
do you bully her often?

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.540
Why is she so upset?

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.899
There, there.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.540
Alright.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.180
Stop crying now.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.319
No more tears.

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:12.800
There, there.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:13.680
No more crying.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.259
Master,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.540
Lin Xia's autopsy report.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.860
Okay.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.100
Primary cause of death was asphyxiation.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.699
Irregular burn marks around the eyes

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.160
and other injuries on the body.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.160
No foreign object in the airway.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.339
No fluid in the lungs.

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.379
So she died before drowning.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:39.259
Master,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.139
Lin Xia was murdered.

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:42.160
The killer

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.860
is likely

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.220
the mastermind behind all this.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.000
I strongly recommend

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.480
a full investigation on Ye Dong.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.540
Master,

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.319
it must be Ye Dong.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.899
Should we arrest him now?

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.139
Without concrete evidence,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.420
requesting a warrant

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:58.899
would only alert our suspect.

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.839
Moreover,

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:01.500
he's currently the city's

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.339
commercial councilor

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.939
and close with the Speaker.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.139
Hard to deal

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.100
with him.

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:12.699
This is

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:14.920
a cunning serpent

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.519
entrenching at the highest level.

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:19.360
We get only one shot.

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:20.300
We must

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.160
strike decisively.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.259
Otherwise,

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:23.740
endless trouble!

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:35.459
Sir,

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:36.319
help me.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.259
Someone's after me.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.100
How?

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.939
Where is she?

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:49.860
Over there.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.459
They've left.

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:58.740
Wait a bit longer.

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:00.399
My legs are weak. I'm scared.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.779
Wait until they

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.579
get further away.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.300
That was terrifying.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.680
Good thing you were here.

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:17.639
Thank you.

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:18.639
No trouble at all.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.439
Goodbye.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.819
What's wrong?

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.100
Something else?

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:25.620
I'm feeling

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.060
so unsettled right now.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.660
I need someone to stay with me.

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:31.180
Will you listen to me?

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:31.980
Sorry,

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:33.139
I'm busy.

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:35.720
I'm the CFO of Jiuyao Group.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.139
My name

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:41.980
is Qin Yufei.

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:44.220
(Knowing who I am,)

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.720
(he'll try to cozy up now.)

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040
(You rascal.)

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:48.480
(Playing hard to get.)

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.939
True.

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:51.500
Late at night,

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:53.259
a beauty like you

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:54.899
shouldn't be out alone.

00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:57.500
After reconsidering,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.360
I'll stay with you.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:01.699
Let's hear your story.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.860
If you want my story,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.420
buy me a drink.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:08.699
Deal?

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:09.939
Deal.

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:11.660
Let's go to

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:13.100
somewhere private.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.220
This wine smells nice.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.419
This is more than enough to drink.

00:08:56.539 --> 00:08:57.620
Bring the bottle over.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.539
Today, let's drink

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.460
until we're drunk!

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.700
Okay.

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:22.620
To the beauty!

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.799
Cheers!

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.500
Cheers!

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.659
What can I do?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.620
You are

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.799
Mrs. Cheng, right?

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.299
I'm

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:56.820
a friend of Cheng Nuo and Bai Cha.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.779
I'm Ye Dong.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.700
Hello.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.620
Please come in.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.019
Cheng Nuo isn't back yet.

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:02.860
Bai Cha is home.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:03.419
Alright.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:04.580
Have a seat.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.460
Bai Cha,

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.460
Ye Dong is here.

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:14.980
Mom.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.580
Go ahead and chat.

00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:23.740
I'll get you some fruit.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:24.340
Okay.

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:25.019
Thank you.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:34.659
What?

00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:35.100
Let go!

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.379
Don't you miss me at all?

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.500
No.

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:44.379
You're not welcome here.

00:10:44.379 --> 00:10:45.179
Get out now!

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.340
Let go!

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:01.860
Let...

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.340
You better behave.

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:07.720
If Mrs. Cheng sees this,

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:09.700
it won't end well.

00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:11.740
Let go!

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.379
What do you want?

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:20.740
I missed you

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.460
so much that I can't eat or sleep.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.899
What do you think I want?

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.200
Ye Dong,

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:36.820
let go!

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.139
Let me go.

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:47.860
You're a lunatic.

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:50.039
You're a madman.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.360
Bai Cha,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.360
the fruit is almost ready.

00:11:58.559 --> 00:11:59.679
Take care of Ye Dong.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.340
Alright.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.740
Mom,

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.980
I will.

00:12:04.379 --> 00:12:05.179
I'm begging you.

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:06.379
Don't let her see this.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.320
Be reasonable!

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.059
Beg me.

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:19.220
I'm begging you.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.000
Go.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:25.179
Where?

00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:30.500
I'll take you

00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:32.460
to watch a good show.

00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:36.399
Let's go.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.759
The fruit's ready.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.919
Where are they?
