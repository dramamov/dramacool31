[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.940
[Episode 33]

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.009
Senior Shizai.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.560
Father, Sheriff Su is here.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.620
Sheriff Su.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310
Seems like you all heard that.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.710
Yes.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.640
This is a matter
between my student and me.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.100
Please don't read into it.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.500
You're here again.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.750
Do you have something to ask me?

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.000
It seems you've already guessed

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.300
what I want to ask.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.100
Yeah.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.750
The death of a mere coroner
is insignificant,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.280
yet it happened right when

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.120
news of the Coroners' Contest

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.310
reached here.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.970
That makes it highly unusual.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.900
After I retired,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.360
Yao also quit the coroner trade.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.960
Only then did Chang'an have

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
the so-called Five Great Coroners.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.120
They are:

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.940
Dong Yue, who worked
for the Ministry of Justice;

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.520
Xiahou Shuang, who mostly serves

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.680
the Court of Judicial Review;

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.520
Liu Wei of the Yongzhou Prefecture;

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.840
Zheng Hao, coroner of Chang'an County;

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.870
and finally,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.130
the one I just expelled from my tutelage—

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.310
Zhong Shizai.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.150
Now that Dong Yue is dead,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.800
the other four all have motives
for the crime.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.000
Of course.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.980
When Dong Yue was shot and killed,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.560
Shizai and I

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.780
were drinking together with Sheriff Su,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.030
so he can be ruled out first.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.190
Thank you for your guidance.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.430
Also,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.590
Shizai just told me

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.750
that three days ago,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.360
he'd already heard the news.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.360
The other three

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.120
are all colleagues in the government,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360
so they must have known as well.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.870
Therefore, if anyone pretends not to know,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.090
that person would also be suspicious.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.210
Thank you again.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.870
Geng Wushang

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.400
is just an old coroner.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.079
He's actually helping you with the case.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.110
Maybe he means well.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.470
Isn't his analysis

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.680
very solid?

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.860
But the ones with the motive to kill

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.460
aren't limited to coroners.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.590
The problem is…

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.560
What is it?

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.250
What was I trying to say again?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.960
I used to respect him a lot,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.800
but at his age,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.010
he still wants to join some contest

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.030
and fight for

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.750
the chance to enter official service.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.080
Turns out he's just another ordinary man.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.240
Actually, I think

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.269
this exactly shows how much

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.750
the coroner profession
needs this opportunity.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.270
His Majesty is truly wise!

First day on the job,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.630
and you ran into such a bizarre case?

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.750
Exactly.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.830
This case is indeed tricky.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.720
Why don't you

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.240
take it over instead?

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.800
Su Wuming.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.970
I'm not falling for that trick.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.370
I came this time

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.950
After all, you're back in the office,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.430
and it's worth celebrating.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.120
But since you're busy
with important matters,

Give me some advice.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.600
Does the analysis

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.630
of Coroner Geng make sense to you?

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.790
Of course it makes sense.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.600
However,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.930
we can first rule out Coroner Liu Wei,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.310
because at 3 PM today,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.870
he was with me on an investigation.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.870
Good approach.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.110
We can eliminate them one by one.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.750
The Court of Judicial Review
has many cases,

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.240
and we both know
Coroner Xiahou Shuang well.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.310
He can be temporarily ruled out too.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.390

Know him? Far more than that!

with the most prestigious background

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.270
in the whole Tang Empire.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.240
He's from the Zheng family
of Xingyang.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.390
A coroner from a prestigious family—

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.360
how could anyone forget that?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.390
I remember that his ancestor

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.040
was a great general under Dou Jiande,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.430
a master archer who never missed a shot.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.040
Later,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.510
when Dou Jiande was defeated

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.310
by Emperor Taizong,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.510
his ancestor refused to surrender

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.190
and remained proud
of his aristocratic lineage.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.450
This infuriated Emperor Taizong so much

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.310
that he punished his branch of the family

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.270
to work as coroners for all generations.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.870
Exactly.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.960
And as you just said,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.030
his ancestor was an expert
in mounted archery.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.560
Yes.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.030
After all,
among the coroners in the capital,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.150
there are many experts.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.150
Although I'm one of
the Five Great Coroners,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.280
I've always been modest and cautious.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.030
I wouldn't dare say I'm fully confident.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.790
Moreover,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.360
I have no family to support,
no mouths to feed.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.550
I don't need to worry about
my descendants getting official posts.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.320
So,

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.350
I might as well not participate.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.320
This afternoon at three,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.790
where were you, Zheng?

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.960
Out hunting.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.270
Those animals hanging outside—

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.130
you saw them just now, didn't you?

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.080
But those kills

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.600
don't look like they were shot
in the afternoon.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.870
From the color of the wounds

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.350
and the smell of the blood,

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.190
they look more like
they were killed this morning.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.840
Are you showing off

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.840
your coroner's knowledge to me?

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.750
Zheng Hao,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440
where's your bow?

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.600
What do you want?

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.480
Your family is known
for superb archery skills.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.550
I'm sure your bow has been
passed down through generations

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.880
and is an excellent one.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.770
I'd like to have a look at it.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.840
What?

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.820
You're suspecting me now?

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.910
Who said anything about suspicion?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.600
Official Lu just wants to appreciate

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.830
your bow, that's all.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.320
Fine.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.870
Wait here.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.910
I'll go get it.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.670
Watch out!

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.870
It really is you!

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.480
Zheng,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.870
how about we go somewhere else for tea?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.800
Zheng Hao,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.360
why did you attack a court official?

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.270
Your groundless suspicions

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.200
are an insult.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.840
For my ancestor's honor,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.270
I had to shoot that Lu
from Fanyang dead!

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.270
So what?

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.840
It's a pity that your archery skills
aren't good enough.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.390
You've disgraced your ancestor.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.910
I can certainly
hit a target from 100 paces

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.240
and kill you with one arrow.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.440
With a door in the way,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.060
you got lucky, that's all.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.840
And the second arrow?

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.340
I shoot far, not close.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.700
For the second arrow, you were too close!

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.240
You can't aim well when targets are close?

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.670
That's the first time
I've ever heard that.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.200
Come, bring me his quiver.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.520
This quiver

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.320
has been used for years, hasn't it?

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.480
Are you blind,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.080
or are you deliberately
looking down on me?

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.810
Can't you tell it's brand-new?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.020
I bought it the day before yesterday!

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.360
Is that so?

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.790
Zheng Hao,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.510
at the Dukang Restaurant,

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.120
Coroner Dong Yue was hit by an arrow

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.510
at 3 PM.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.080
You shot it, didn't you?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.030
Dong Yue is dead?

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.560
Nothing to do with me.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.750
Did I say he died?

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.000
I heard from others that he died.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.750
Measure his foot.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.000
The length matches perfectly.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.790
Zheng Hao,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.650
directly across
from the Dukang Restaurant,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.390
on the second floor of the wine storeroom,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.720
we found the killer's footprints.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.250
They match yours exactly.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.550
What more do you have to say?

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.210
Plenty of people have feet this size.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.360
These boots are completely ordinary.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.690
You could find 10,000 pairs
just like them in Chang'an.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.490
That doesn't count as evidence.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.960
Just now, you said

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.840
this is a new quiver.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.510
In the Tang Empire,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.670
everything follows regulations.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.080
A standard quiver

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.510
holds 30 arrows.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.920
Your quiver is quite expensive,

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.540
and quivers like this

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.380
usually come with new arrows.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.670
And your arrows

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.360
are indeed brand new.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.630
You also claim you can hit a target
100 paces away

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.600
and never need a second shot when hunting.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.260
Therefore,

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.910
one arrow for the hare,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.470
one arrow for the fox.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.370
According to hunting custom,

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.870
arrows that kill game
don't need to be retrieved.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.440
They're left as offerings
to the mountain god.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.470
After the two arrows you shot at me,

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.440
you should have 26 new arrows

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.960
left in your quiver.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.120
But there are only 25 here.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.960
Where's the missing one?

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.150
That…

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.870
Bring it up.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480
Exactly the same.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.750
The brand-new arrow that killed Dong Yue

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.360
came from your quiver!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.030
When it comes to martial skills
and weapons,

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.560
you can't fool Official Lu.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.030
I was hunting in the mountains.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.790
At 3 PM…

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.120
At 3 PM, I hadn't even come back!

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.510
Do you have witnesses?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.320
The beasts and birds in the mountains

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.060
can testify for me.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.080
Sheriff Su,

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.150
no need to waste words on him.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.250
Just beat him up.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.320
But for someone like him,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.390
beating him
in the county office is useless.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.080
Drag him to the East Market
and beat him there!

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.480
Let everyone in Chang'an

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.620
watch him get beaten!

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.220
A gentleman can be killed,
but not humiliated!

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.720
You'd better not sully

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.980
the word "gentleman."

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.910
What are you all standing around for?

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.720
Take him to the East Market and beat him!

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.600
After that, drag him to the West Market
and keep beating him!

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.150
And then to the Ghost Market!

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.810
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:41.960
Move!

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.750
Wait!

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.330
Just kill me!

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.030
I'm the one who killed Dong Yue.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.750
I confess!

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.910
Zheng Hao,

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.680
on the court,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.480
you need to think carefully
before you speak.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.100
Because everything you say

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.870
will be recorded

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.510
and used as evidence to convict you.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.030
Great, great.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.960
Officers,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.150
greetings.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.270
Dong Yue.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.120
Didn't you see me?

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.910
I did.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.700
You're just a coroner.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.570
Why do you always

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.930
hang around officials?

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.930
We all come from gentry families.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.080
I don't care who your ancestors were.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.440
You…

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.370
You're nothing but a coroner now,

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.150
and one

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.080
whose skills are inferior to mine.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.140
Just you wait,

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.390
Dong Yue!

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.360
This happened half a month ago.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.390
I'd almost forgotten about it.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.250
But yesterday,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.440
there was a case in Chang'an County

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.360
where two corpses were found
at the same time.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.420
Zhong Shizai and I each examined one.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.950
When we were comparing our findings…

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.980
[To the Zheng of Xingyang]

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.380
Zhong Shizai.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.200
Who sent me this letter?

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:19.960
A letter?

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.740
I didn't see anything.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.320
The Zheng family of Xingyang
can't be humiliated like that.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.440
To wash away this shame,

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.370
tomorrow at 3 PM,

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.720
at the Gaochang Tavern,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.550
by the second-floor window
of the backyard warehouse,

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.150
nock an arrow and draw the bow

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.550
to shoot at Meiwu
in the Dukang Restaurant.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.760
You can take your revenge then.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.270
What does the letter say?

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.840
Nothing.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.510
I was half-convinced.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.000
I had just bought
a new bow and arrows.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.240
I went hunting early in the morning.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.510
I shot a hare first

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.070
and then a fox.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.490
Yet I was still agitated and restless,

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.580
so I took the bow and arrows

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.880
and went up to the second floor
of that warehouse.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.030
You killed Dong Yue—

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.440
it wasn't just for revenge, was it?

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.790
Can you swear

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:53.960
it had nothing to do with the upcoming

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.090
Coroners' Contest?

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.340
Of course it had something to do with it.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.110
My ancestor backed the wrong man,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.830
and as a result,

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.270
Emperor Taizong demoted us
to the lowest social class.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.440
By my generation,

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640
I've already risen to be one of

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.830
the Five Great Coroners in Chang'an.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.000
If I win this contest,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.070
I might be able to shed this lowly status.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.440
Getting rid of Dong Yue

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.270
would make my chances much greater.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.070
After all, Dong's coroner skills

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.210
really were superb.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.270
Among the five of us,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.760
he was number one.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.990
Where is that letter?

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.920
It's on me.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.540
This beard must be a disguise,

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.150
but it's done quite well.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.200
Because Gao Wuniang's

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.550
strongest impression of him

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.400
was the beard.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.720
She couldn't clearly describe
his eyes or brows at all.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.440
So I find it hard to picture

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.960
what he looks like

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.430
without that fake beard.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:18:59.790

thank you a lot.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.690
Enough talk about the case.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.030
Su Wuming has returned
to official service.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.400
It's his first day on duty,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.160
and I made him look good.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.950
Flawless, wasn't it?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.090
This really is worth celebrating.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.720
Let's get drunk tonight and go home late.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:17.750
Fei,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.510
tomorrow I still need to help Master

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:20.750
investigate cases in the districts.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:21.950
I can't get too drunk.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.960
But it really is worth celebrating.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.620
Sheriff Su,

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.850
I should toast you.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.160
Yes, Wuming.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.270
I'm happy for you.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.310
Su Wuming,

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.030
I'm happy for you too.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.270
Also, although I'm

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.030
a secret agent of Yongzhou Prefecture,

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.840
from now on, I may have to

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.550
spend a lot of time over
in Wannian County.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.510
After all, he

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.000
not only knows no martial arts

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.310
but also loves stirring up trouble.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.510
I have to protect him.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.510
Granted!

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.370
Congratulations.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.400
I hope from now on,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.110
you rise swiftly through the ranks.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.070

we as fellow disciples

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.950
will fight together for the prosperity

share joy, and weather storms together.

Walking hand in hand, we fear nothing.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.270

Yingtao,

I'm afraid you can only have this one cup.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.930
I've suddenly remembered
that in today's Chang'an,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.220
there is someone who is the least safe

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.280
and needs your protection.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.070
Who?

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.550

What's going on?

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.440
You've been reciting
"Ode to the Goddess of Luo"

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.640
for two days already.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.300
Do you really need a third day?

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.360

[Zhong Shizai's daughter, Zhong Jie]

He's been studying very hard.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.210
It's just that…

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.200
Just what?

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.130
The rascal next door
messed with us again.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.880
He said Pi shouldn't study
poetry and literature.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.680
That he should follow you
and learn to be a coroner.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.490
What exactly did he say?

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.550

Do you still need

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.200
your sister
to say something like that for you?

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200
That rascal said

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.720
you're a coroner,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.030
so in the future, I can only be a coroner.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.960
Coroners just examine dead people.

There's no need to be literate

I wanted to go beat him up,

but I was afraid I couldn't win,

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.030
and then he'd have the chance

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:16.760
to bully Jie.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.060
So I ignored him

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.930
and just kept protecting Jie.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.400
That's why I fell behind on my recitation.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.470
Very clearly said.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:33.950
To have a son like you,

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.880

You'll no longer be a coroner?

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.010
I'll still be a coroner,

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.240
but an officially appointed coroner
in the county office,

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.700
no longer of lowly status.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.160
You'll also have the chance

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.160
to take the imperial examinations.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.170
As for Jie,

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.750
you've got great talent for painting.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:05.310
I will

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.590
definitely find you

a famous teacher

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:08.920

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.370
the greatest painter in the Tang Empire.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.390
In the future,

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.270
you'll even marry into

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.750
a noble family.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.200

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.160
Really.

I

promise you both.

Thank you, Father.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.310
But

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.200
I don't want to marry a noble.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.760
I just want to stay and care for you.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.440

you've been working hard all day.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.040
Today is also your birthday.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:05.960

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.200
Father,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.830
today is your birthday.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.020
Don't say such inauspicious things.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.160
Father,

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.510
that old man Sheriff Su brought—

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.720
didn't they say he's a miracle doctor?

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.000
Why won't you let him

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.400
take a look at your sores?

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.160
Although I'm just a coroner,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.270
I do know a bit of medicine.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.400
What I've got is terminal.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.120
There's no curing it.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.790
Then why did you still say

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.830
you wanted to join the Coroners' Contest?

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.490
I actually took it seriously.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:54.750
Truth be told,

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.750
I even felt happy for a moment.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.750
That was for your own future, wasn't it?

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.200
No, I was happy for you, Father.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.920
You're unquestionably
the best coroner in Chang'an,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.440
no, in the whole world.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.510
Just like you said,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.510
if you could make a name
for yourself across the realm

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.510
with everything you've learned,

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.110
how wonderful that would be!

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.720
Enough praising me.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.550
Have you memorized everything
you were supposed to memorize today?

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.270
Yes.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.720
Let me hear it.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.110
When a head is severed by a sharp blade,

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.790
the cut on the skull is clean and smooth.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.180
For more information,
check the flesh under the neck.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.880
If the tendons are curled and contracted

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.340
and the shoulder bones are raised,

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:30.750
[Speak and Seek Truth]

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:33.240
it means the victim was alive
when decapitated.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.830
If the head is cut off after death,

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.630
the tendons will not contract.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:36.750
[Speak and Seek Truth]

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.270
If the body is close to a wall,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.270
the coroner needs to check

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.130
whether there is blood on the wall

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.240
and if it appears in spray patterns.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.350
[Speak and Seek Truth]

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.640
In decapitation cases,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.510
the coroner needs to measure

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.270
the distance
between the head and the shoulders

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.030
and record

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.160
the position of the head
relative to the body.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:50.920
Furthermore,

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.910
fit the head back onto the neck

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.340
and measure the neck circumference.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.290
And finally,

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.240
have the family identify the body

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.280
to confirm it is the same person.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.920
If the murder weapon has a flat tip,

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.160
can you record it as stabbing?

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.960
No.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.630
Only pointed weapons

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.270
can be recorded as stabbing.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:10.880
Good.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.240
Father,

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:13.960
you need to rest now.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.030
I'm in a good mood today.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.250
Let me teach you a little more.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.920
I'll tell you right now

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.070
how to examine for strychnine poisoning.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.640
Memorize it carefully.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:28.030
Yes.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.830
Those poisoned by strychnine

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.160
first feel weakness;

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.300
the neck stiffens,

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.190
and then the shoulders and thighs

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.470
go into spasms

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.350
until the whole body convulses,

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.150
finally arching like a drawn bow,

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.980
bending over and over.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.010
The pain is among the worst
a person can suffer.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.440
This is a truly vicious poison.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.760
In murder cases,

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.550
you rarely see it.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.790
Some coroners

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.640
never encounter it in their whole career.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.870
But to be a truly good coroner,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.070
you must know
how to recognize this poison.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.400
I've got it, Father.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.590
I really envy you.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.790
Youth is a blessing.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.440
You don't need to write it down

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.030
and can remember it all in your head.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.350
Honey,

will happen to us soon.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.880
Why do you say that?

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.240
You know what?

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.400
Our daughter

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.720

on the street today.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.590
She counted them.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.470
49 coins in total.

How auspicious is that!

Our girl has been worrying about marriage,

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.240

this means a heaven-sent match

Didn't you say

one should focus on studying first

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.450
and practice martial arts
if there's extra energy?

Mastering both civil and martial arts

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.200
Yes.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.640
Take your sister home.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.150
Father!

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.030
Pi,

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.360
go home.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.840
Official Lu,

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:20.920
you refrained from fighting

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.320
in front of my children.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.550
Thank you.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.170
You used Zheng Hao to murder Dong Yue—

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.110
killing two birds with one arrow

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:29.750
to ensure

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.070
you would win

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.070
the Coroners' Contest.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.199
That scheme of yours

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.060
was far too vicious and underhanded.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.550
It seems

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.320
you have no intention
of dismounting and surrendering.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.469
I used the name of General Lyu.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.550
A general may die in battle

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.670
but never dismounts to surrender.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.070
Well, well, as a coroner,

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:51.150
you can also fight on horseback?

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.679
Try me, and you'll know.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.360
Two years ago,

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.920
I heard the General
of the Right Imperial Guards

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.190
single-handedly crushed the Four Ghosts
in the Ghost Market

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.850
using a three-section spear.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.230
I was deeply impressed,

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.280
so I modified

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.570
this snake spear

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.360
that had served me for years.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.230
I was born a slave

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.510
and trained hard since childhood.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.710
Only by becoming a coroner

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.170
did I rise from slave status
to lowly status.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.920
But not a day passed that stopped

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.630
studying literature
or practicing martial arts.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.220
If you defeat me today,

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.880
I'll acknowledge your skill.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.800
But if I unhorse you

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.600
with a single thrust of my spear,

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.920
then some foreign nation

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.400
will gain

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.760
a great General Zhong to lead its armies.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.790
General Zhong, huh?

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.970
To make a name for yourself,

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.030
you're going to betray the Tang Empire?

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.060
Enough talk. Bring it on!

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.320
They say that villain's martial skills
are formidable.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.840
If you hadn't stepped in to help,

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.880
we in Wannian County

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.880
really wouldn't

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.630
have caught him.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.060
Skip the flattery.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.280
Xue Huan has already gone ahead

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.110
into the districts to handle cases.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.670
I won't keep you company
during the interrogation.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:38.270
Farewell.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.610
Lu Lingfeng!

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.670
Lingfeng,

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.030
I owe you big.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.550
Thank you very much.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.020
I hope Wannian County,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.320
under Sheriff Su's governance,

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.480
enjoys long-lasting peace.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.710
May Wannian County
enjoy long-lasting peace.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.230
I am innocent.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.550
Sheriff Su,

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.920
when Master Di arrested people,

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.030
he always relied on solid evidence.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.590
You think you're clever

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.620
and left no trace at all?

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.230
I do, so what?

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.600
Without concrete evidence,

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:26.510
I will never confess.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.670
[To the Zheng of Xingyang]
[Invitation]

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.880
The writing on the letter

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.190
has traces of brown
mixed with the black ink.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.760
That should be

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.220
pigment from painting.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.800
This means the person
either paints regularly

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.130
or constantly has a painter at their side.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.070
You named your son Pi

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.840
and your daughter Jie.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.800
Those are the very characters
Emperor Wu of Wei

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.510
used for his own children.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.000
So what?

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.670
Your daughter is named Zhong Jie.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.100
You've trained her in painting

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.480
since she was little,

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.490
haven't you?

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:15.920
Zhong Jie,

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.510
you paint very well.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.230
I'm just curious—

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.030
how do you keep the painting table

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.110
so perfectly neat?

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.590
It's because Father doesn't allow anyone

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.590
to use this table,

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.590
not even Pi,

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.520
and not even Father himself.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.110
Then where does your father usually write?

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.670
When Father needs to write,

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.920
he just uses my pigment dishes

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.880
and makes do.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.800
If you think it's necessary,

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.920
we can verify it.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.450
The letter sent to Zheng Hao

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:54.280
and the invitations

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.540
to those five coroners

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.280
were written with the ink here.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.930
And you, Zhong Shizai,

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.070
are extremely skilled with a brush,

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:03.190
yet you pretended

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.320
to be illiterate.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:05.740
The handwriting on the letters—

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.920
[General Lyu]

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.620
you deliberately made it look clumsy,

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.150
right?

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.820
That's nothing more than your speculation.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.670
Su Wuming,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.760
you couldn't solve the case yourself,

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.760
so you sent a woman

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:18.710
to trick my daughter?

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:23.220
This lady is no ordinary person.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.550
She's Miss Pei Xijun.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.930
I wouldn't say she's the best painter

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.880
in all of Chang'an,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.800
but she's definitely the finest

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.670
among female painters in Chang'an.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.480
Really?

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.960
Miss Pei,

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.950
could my daughter be your student?

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.360
She's very talented.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.300
You should confess first.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.800
Look at this.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.920
I found it in your house.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.480
See for yourself.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.320
Put it on him.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.670
Come.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.510
Now look at this.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.080
Who painted that?

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800
Miss Pei

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.360
drew it
based on Gao Wuniang's description.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.110
Does this count

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.440
as solid evidence now?

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.630
Miss Pei,

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.110
please take Jie as your student.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:28.710
No.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:30.000
Please take her

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:31.790
as your goddaughter.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:35.800
Miss Pei,

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.510
Jie is clever and filial.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.190
I truly cannot bear

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.010
to let her remain in the lowly status
her whole life.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.230
Zhong Shizai,

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:45.800
Zhong Jie is very gifted,

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.800
and I like her too.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.460
If the chance arises,

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.190
I'll definitely teach her painting.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.390
But this is the court.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.360
Get up now.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:52.590
I…

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:53.590
Zhong Shizai,

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.110
you deeply love your children,

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.360
but that's no excuse for your crimes.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.360
I didn't kill anyone directly.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.840
I just invited someone to dinner.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840
How is that wrong?

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.550
Zheng Hao killed for revenge.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:15.960
What has that got to do with me?

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.820
Just to make sure

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.630
you could place in the top three
of the Coroners' Contest,

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.400
you even tried to kill your own mentor

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.800
who taught you your skills!

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.640
Zhong Shizai,

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.550
what other crimes have you committed?

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:29.750
Confess truthfully!

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:33.550
I haven't!

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.730
Mr. Geng already anticipated

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.150
you'd say that.
