[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.940
[Episode 31]

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.070
Spare my life!

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.910
Spare my life! Please!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.800
Immortal, please spare my life!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.660
Immortal, please have mercy!

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.680
There're no immortals here,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.600
only ghost officials.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.700
A woman's soul

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.030
has reported you to the King of Hell,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.750
so we've come to take your life.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.490
Surrender your life!

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.710
No! I'm innocent!

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.250
I-I'm innocent!

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.600
Please, Official...

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.590
I beg the King of Hell for mercy!

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.160
The King of Hell never
makes a wrong judgment.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.410
That soul's owner is surnamed Wei.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.990
What exactly did you do to her?

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.490
Into the oil cauldron!

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.000
Into the oil cauldron!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.120
I'll confess! I'll confess!

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.190
I'll confess! I'll confess!

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.960
Ghost...

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.310
I saw a ghost.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800
What ghost?

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.400
I say it's your guilty conscience!

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.370
Keep arguing,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.150
and I'll throw you into the oil cauldron
and fry you!

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.280
Into the oil cauldron!

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.240
[Wei Mansion]

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.040
I'll confess.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.680
Since ancient times,
merchants have had no status.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.680
[Wei Mansion]

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.540
To establish myself in Chang'an,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.280
I sought the hand of the widow

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.310
from the Wei family
who recently returned to Chang'an.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.470
Wei Jia was proud,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.320
and Wei Tao tried every means to stop us.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.630
But my methods

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.090
were too clever to resist.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.970
Finally, Wei Jia fell for me.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.930
After a big fight with her brother,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.870
[In Virtuous Company]

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.870
she pledged herself to me in secret.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.480
What the hell are you doing?

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.120
Throw all these out right now!

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.190
Tao.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.710
These flowers have done nothing wrong.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.910
I quite like them.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.660
I originally thought marrying Wei Jia

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.280
would bring me the benefits
of the Wei family,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.810
and it would be of help to me.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.870
But I never expected

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.950
that not only would Wei Tao not help me,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.680
he'd even constantly make things
difficult for me!

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.040
How I despise him!

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.040
Later, my business failed,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.640
and I ended up owing
tens of thousands of coins.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.130
The only one who could help me then

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.040
was Shi Qiansui.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.800
He...

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.930
That old lecher...

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.320
I'm curious about

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.159
what gentry ladies are like.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.270
If I could get what I want,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.780
those tens of thousands of coins
wouldn't be a problem.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.070
I knew

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.760
Wei Jia would never consent,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.360
so I had no choice but to
drug her unconscious.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.070
But I didn't expect

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.790
the dose to be too weak.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.120
Wei Jia woke up

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.590
before dawn.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.150
When she saw Shi Qiansui,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.610
she tried to kill herself.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.950
I was worried

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.750
this would reach Wei Tao's ears,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.150
so I had no choice but to lock her up.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.720
But she made such a scene

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.510
that I had to beat her a few times.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.000
I never expected...

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.470
I never expected she'd go mad
because of it.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.270
Every night she'd cry and wail,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.120
not letting anyone sleep.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.230
At that time,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.140
your brother He Qian
was also living in your house.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.730
He already suffered from insomnia,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.230
so he tried to use

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.230
water-soaked paper to suffocate Wei Jia.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.950
Let me go!

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.659
What are you doing?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.390
We might as well suffocate her to death.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.630
That way, she won't keep raving
every night.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.070
And with no visible wounds,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.920
her family will have nothing to say

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.830
when they come.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.480
You bastard!

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.960
You saved Wei Jia

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.120
not out of kindness,

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.800
but because you found a new way
to make money.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.140
She'd already gone mad anyway.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.160
It was also Shi Qiansui's fault

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.300
for spreading this scandal.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.630
Those merchants of the Jinguang Society

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.490
who were later killed by Wei and Du

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.360
were all willing to pay a fortune

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.310
for a night with a gentry lady.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.820
So I made it happen for them.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.310
Miss Wei would never have agreed to that!

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.150
It was you who kept drugging her.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.580
You're the one who drove her mad!

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.060
Sister-in-law, who am I marrying today?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.240
I...

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.230
You beast!

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.190
Xijun.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.870
Xijun.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.650
[Fair and Just]

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.040
What happened after that?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.920
Later,

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.130
Wei Jia suddenly ran away one day.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.310
I knew she went back to her own family.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.680
But when I went to get her back,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.750
they refused.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.310
Wei Tao even threatened to kill me.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.870
After that,

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.200
when the Jinguang Society
expanded their villa,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.909
the merit-record pillars of
the Wei and Du families were dug up.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.309
And in a fit of anger , I...

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.430
Usually,

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.000
this kind of madness
doesn't remain constant.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.150
Wei Jia must have had lucid moments

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.320
when she told Du Juniang

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.840
about the abuse she had suffered.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.850
That's why when Wei Tao killed He Qian,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.250
he used such a distinctive method.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.780
He deserves death.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.080
[Grand Princess's Mansion]

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.600
Wei Tao must not be killed.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.030
This man has long declared

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.600
his loyalty to Your Highness,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.910
and he's talented both
in literature and martial arts.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.630
He's someone with great potential.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.270
Moreover,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.640
those merchants he killed

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.830
all deserved to die.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.440
The so‑called Jinguang Society
is filled with wicked people.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.120
According to investigations,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.150
they've harmed many innocent women.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.410
They should have been wiped out long ago!

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.390
Chancellor Cui,

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.860
I've never seen you so agitated before.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.120
I apologize for my rudeness.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.000
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.810
The Yongzhou Prefecture Office

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.600
has thoroughly investigated

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.400
all the details of the case.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.440
Although there's no testimony
from Wei Tao,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.440
I understand his anger.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.700
My views are different from
my mother's.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.550
I value the gentry more.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.670
As for Wei Tao,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.200
I didn't think much of him before.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.200
But the fact that

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.030
he would do something so earth-shattering

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.980
for his sister and for the honor of
the Wei family

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.230
really makes me see him in a new light.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.840
However,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.510
one cannot govern a nation on impulse.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.900
As for how to deal with Wei and Du,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.040
I'm rather interested in waiting

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.080
to see what their attitude will be.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.510
How could such a thing have happened?

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.630
Those bad apples are utterly despicable,

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.510
and they've tarnished the reputation
of the merchant community!

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.310
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.830
Your Majesty.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.090
Du Yu cannot be executed.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.110
He was merely an accomplice.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.580
Those vicious merchants

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.720
smashed the Du family's
ancestral merit-record pillar.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.120
How could anyone tolerate such an offense?

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.570
More importantly,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.990
Du Yu has long declared

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.400
his loyalty to Your Majesty.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.330
Though he's only a county sheriff,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.290
he's a remarkable talent

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.020
of the new generation of the Du family.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.720
Besides, his martial skills
are exceptional.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.600
He's a promising talent
who could be of great use.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.910
I've never seen you go to such lengths

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.510
to plead for someone before.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:11.530
Your Majesty,

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.540
you asked me to secretly recruit talents.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.590
After careful selection,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.980
Du Yu was my top choice.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.320
What a pity.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.070
He has more than one life on his hands.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.230
Even if I don't want to execute him,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.240
the people

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.080
will say I favor the gentry.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.840
Moreover,

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.070
there's also my aunt to consider.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.220
I wonder what her opinion
on this matter is.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.360
Ji, have a seat.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.240
Yes.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.150
Are you close friends with Wei and Du, Ji?

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.000
Not really.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.730
We haven't known each other for long.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.470
You have a heart for justice—

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.200
truly a rare talent for

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.160
governing the country.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.030
If you ask me now,

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.480
I will ensure Wei and Du

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.000
remain safe and unharmed.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.720
Your Highness must've misunderstood.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.180
I'm Master Di's disciple.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.840
My mentor taught me
that the law shows no mercy.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.030
As for Wei Tao

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.120
and Du Yu,

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.670
their anger

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.200
is indeed understandable,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.900
but taking multiple lives

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.610
is an unforgivable crime.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.570
Though they're from the gentry

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.980
and they're talented,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.360
the law of our country
must not be violated.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.200
This is also one of the key principles

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:49.960
ensuring our Tang Empire's

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.090
path to prosperity.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.230
Is this truly what you think, my son?

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:58.870
Yes.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.480
The gentry

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.000
are supposed to hold themselves

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.200
to higher standards.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.110
If one day

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.670
I, Lu Lingfeng, break the law,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.000
I should also

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.960
be severely punished.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.050
Ji, you're becoming more and more like me.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.320
What's that merchant's name?

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.090
He Bi.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.970
If Wei and Du are to be beheaded,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.840
then have him cut in half at the waist.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.370
If they're to be cut in half,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.630
then have him torn apart by 5 horses!

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.760
Tell Xiong Qiannian to inform them

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.270
that these are my orders.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.200
As for Shi Qiansui,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.220
strip him of his position,
confiscate his property,

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.880
and banish him from Chang'an!

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.630
No,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.760
from all Tang territory!

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.720
He's never to set foot on

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.580
the land of our Tang Empire again!

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.840
Yes.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.720
I fully agree with my aunt's opinion.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.170
For the position of High Priest
of the High Priest's Office,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.750
do you have a suitable candidate?

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.120
The West Market Magistrate, Kang Yuanli,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.030
is loyal and dedicated,

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.360
with an excellent reputation.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.550
He can be promoted to the High Priest

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.960
and keep serving as
the West Market Magistrate.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.120
Seems appropriate to me.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.600
Have the Ministry of Personnel
issue the order.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.150
Yes.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.080
Xiong Qiannian.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.600
With such incidents occurring in Chang'an,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.600
what's your view
as Yongzhou's Chief Administrator?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.800
Your Majesty,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.290
I have failed in my governance

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.350
and am guilty.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.360
Guilty indeed!

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.870
You'd been in Nanzhou Prefecture
for so long

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.960
and only returned to the capital
a few days ago.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.480
Even if I wanted to assign blame,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.910
it wouldn't fall on you.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.480
What I want to ask you is,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.340
with such a major case occurring,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.080
what's your opinion

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.860
on it being solved so quickly?

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.680
Judicial Official Lu Lingfeng

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.270
deserves great credit.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.880
Su Wuming has also done a lot, of course.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.420
Very well, I understand.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.560
You may go.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.320
I take my leave.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.670
Su Wuming.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.960
Though you no longer
hold an official position,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.000
you've been even more diligent
in case investigation.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.530
I'm truly

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.670
impressed by you.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.740
I'm still

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.480
the Chief of Secret Agents
in Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.840
Although I can't exactly
be called an official,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.430
I suppose I can be considered a clerk,

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.160
and I receive a monthly salary.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.550
Everything I do is also within my duties.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:39.780
I remember

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.920
you were once Chang'an County Sheriff.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.530
You solved the black tea case then,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.150
gaining quite a reputation.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.240
In that case,

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.320
Lu Lingfeng deserved more credit.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.770
How about I give you an official position?

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.870
Your Majesty,

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.480
that won't be necessary.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.130
I'm quite content as I am.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.000
It's just that Lu Lingfeng...

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.630
He's currently serving as
the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.960
which is

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.570
beneath his abilities.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.520
Recently, he has repeatedly
solved complex cases

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.000
and protected Your Majesty multiple times.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.080
He deserves a promotion.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.200
Do I need you

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.480
to remind me about his promotions?

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.570
I spoke out of turn.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.390
Your Majesty, please calm down.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.720
You turned down my offer

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.790
to give you an official position.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.120
Are you waiting for the Princess
to grant you a title instead?

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.270
Your Majesty, if you have to
put it this way,

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.510
I am truly speechless.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.200
I intended to give you a higher position,

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.550
but it seems you don't care for it.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.390
Then go back

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.520
to being the Chang'an County Sheriff.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.150
No.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.160
I want you to be the sheriff
of Wannian County.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.830
Your Majesty.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.410
Are you serious?

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.760
A ruler never jokes.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.950
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.950
I thought

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.150
that in this lifetime,

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.920
I would never have another chance
to serve in office.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.650
So you do want to be an official.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.810
I'm the one who gave you this opportunity.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.440
You

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.400
must remember that.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.190
Go back and wait for

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.570
the official appointment from
the Ministry of Personnel.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.310
Move!

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.270
Kill him! Kill him!

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.620
Excellent!

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.920
Great! Excellent!

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.460
Nice kill!

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.830
-Well deserved!
-Great!

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.030
Bring the criminals,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.720
Wei Tao and Du Yu!

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.550
The time has come.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.600
Criminals, kneel
and receive your punishment!

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.000
Father!

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:37.780
Don't you kneel!

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.720
We're the ones who have erred.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.270
You're descendants of the gentry.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.060
You must not kneel before criminals.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.550
Your uncle is right.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.540
Ya, do not kneel.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.000
Darling Wei.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.830
Yu.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.030
Rest assured.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.400
I will definitely raise

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.750
Qing and Ya to adulthood.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.590
The Wei family has passed down
the Book of Songs for generations,

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.830
and the Du family has always studied
the Spring and Autumn Annals.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.850
In our old residence
in the south of the city,

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.310
I'll make sure to take them
to the study room,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.070
where they'll study together
as classmates.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.670
As descendants of Xuancheng

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.680
and Yuankai,

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.160
and with our family's academic traditions,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.400
they won't fail
our prosperous Tang Empire.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.400
Qing,

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.920
Ya,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.320
remember this above all:

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.920
you're the descendants
of the Wei and Du families.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.120
You must uphold family traditions
and principles of law.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.200
You must also study diligently,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.880
because dignity

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.610
comes not only from bloodline,

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.440
but also from

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.240
the knowledge you carry within,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.440
and your loyalty to family and country.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.480
That's it.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.480
You must

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.010
remember this moment,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.010
but you must

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.550
forget today.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.870
It's time!

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.440
Execute them!

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.270
has closed eyes and open lips,
clenched hands and exposed teeth.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.320
If hanged above the throat,
the tongue presses against the teeth,

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.400
so the tongue often protrudes
below the throat.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.860
But your daughter
shows none of these signs.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:14.960
Look.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.360
The ligature mark runs evenly
and straight around her neck,

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.630
and the color is rather shallow.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.429
This is a sign of strangulation.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.760
There are also fingernail marks,

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.070
likely left during an attempt

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.270
to struggle for life.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.120
Furthermore,

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.250
in true hanging, both hands
should be clenched,

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.440
but your daughter's...

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.960
Could it be

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.590
that my daughter

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.280
was actually murdered?

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:41.350
It must have been him.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.760
It must have been them
who killed my daughter!

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:48.190
This...

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.679
Did Master pay you?

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.440
He went to report to the authorities.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.400
When the coroner arrives,

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.060
he'll wipe off all the makeup.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.730
Then I'll apply it again

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.930
and collect payment twice.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.220
Are you a mortician or a coroner?

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.180
If you're a coroner, that's even better.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.230
Chang'an is desperately short of
coroners right now.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.970
I can bring you business,

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.690
and I only ask for 15% commission.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.480
Although my business is not doing well,

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.880
I can still make ends meet

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.070
and am in no need of a middleman.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.510
Besides,

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.630
anyone who charges a commission over 10%

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.550
will be seen as monopolizing the market.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.810
If you charge too much,

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.590
you'll be accused of disrupting the trade.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.250
You can get caned for it.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:31.800
You...

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.820
Do you ever treat people to meals?

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.980
I can book restaurants too.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.000

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.230
the best private rooms
of the best restaurants

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.670
can all be booked through me.

treat someone to a meal,

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:46.630
you can come to me.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:47.630
But don't worry

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.930
about the commission.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.730
The restaurant will pay me directly.
