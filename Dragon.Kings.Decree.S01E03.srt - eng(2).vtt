Are you trying to drag us down

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.269
with you?

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.749
What a shameful sight.

00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:14.989
You old, disrespectful fool,

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.788
your conscience

00:10:15.789 --> 00:10:18.070
is no cleaner than hers.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.869
Who are you to judge her?

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.989
Feng Zhilou,

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.428
don't get carried away.

00:10:22.429 --> 00:10:22.989
That's right.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.470
What are you talking about?

00:10:24.669 --> 00:10:26.869
I'm talking about you, old man!

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.788
You're full of talk about family honor
and meddling in everyone's affairs,

00:10:29.789 --> 00:10:31.828
but all you do is use your power
to boss people around.

00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:32.588
What's it?

00:10:32.589 --> 00:10:33.668
Just because you're old,

00:10:33.669 --> 00:10:35.188
no one can challenge you?

00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:35.869
You!

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.668
Honestly,

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:38.828
you're the biggest
troublemaker in this family!

00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:39.950
You!

00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:44.470
And you too.

00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:46.989
You abandoned your aging father at home

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.908
and treated your wife like nothing.

00:10:48.909 --> 00:10:49.828
If your mother knew

00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:51.349
how you turned out,

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.428
she'd be rolling in her grave!

00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:54.269
You!

00:10:54.669 --> 00:10:56.308
Your son is a treasure to you,

00:10:56.309 --> 00:10:57.908
and your daughter is disposable.

00:10:57.909 --> 00:10:59.548
You worked her to the bone

00:10:59.549 --> 00:11:01.629
and forced her
to marry an old man as a concubine.

00:11:01.709 --> 00:11:04.029
She ended up
throwing herself into the river.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.068
If I were her,

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:06.229
I'd come back as a ghost

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.790
and drag you down with me!

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.269
Feng Qingfeng,

00:11:22.429 --> 00:11:23.909
surprising, isn't it?

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.908
The person you were so eager
to see executed

00:11:25.909 --> 00:11:28.229
is standing here alive.

00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:30.310
Are you disappointed?

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.229
Feng Manor

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:38.269
may have given me life,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.029
but it never raised me.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.308
I may be a girl

00:11:42.309 --> 00:11:43.509
without a spiritual root,

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.710
but I never deserved death.

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:48.909
You framed me
and pinned false charges on me.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.190
You even tried to drown me.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.670
I've already repaid the life

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.710
you gave me.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.190
From today on,

00:11:57.429 --> 00:11:59.149
we have nothing to do with each other.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.109
Zhilou,

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.389
you've misunderstood.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.269
Zhilou,

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.670
you're a daughter of the Feng family.

00:12:10.909 --> 00:12:12.948
You should follow our traditions

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:14.790
and do your duty.

00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:17.629
If you want to leave,

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:19.590
the only way is through marriage.

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:20.989
Otherwise,

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.350
you can never step out of this place.

00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:24.909
I'm...

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.989
the Feng family head.

00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:29.869
I will stop you

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.470
with my life.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.190
What a grand, mighty family head.

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:38.749
It's just marriage, isn't it?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.269
Fine, I'll do it.

00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:41.710
But I decide

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.109
who I marry.
