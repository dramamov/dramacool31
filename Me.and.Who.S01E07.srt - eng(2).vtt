Oh, Your Excellency!

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.840
Why are you here so early?

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.180
Uh, I...

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.640
I have a meeting
with our international clients.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.880
What meeting again?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.600
I don't see it on the schedule.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.760
Uh, it's...

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.320
It's...

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.600
It's an urgent one.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.920
So, I didn't get the chance
to tell you yet.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.280
Oh... An urgent meeting.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.070
Here you go.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.960
Are those all I have to sign?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.720
Allow me to check for just a moment.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.880
- I think...
- Please excuse me.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.440
Where are you going,
Your Excellency?

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080
Ya?

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.560
Shouldn't you be at work?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.960
Why are you here?

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm here just in case
someone misses me.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080
Someone?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.180
Who might that be?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.720
I don't think they're here.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.920
Hm...

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.720
I thought...

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.240
we were on the same page.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.800
Or is it just me?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.920
And you're gonna say
I read your mind again.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.380
But I do want you to this time.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.420
Come on.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.160
I miss you, too, Your Excellency.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.680
Get your work done

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.440
and come home soon, okay?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.720
[M.C. Jakkawarn]

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.200
It's His Serene Highness.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.480
Pick it up.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.920
Pardon?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.160
This event's full of top influencers.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.600
The Prime Minister's
going to join us, too.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.840
I want ideas that are

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.840
classic yet fresh,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.560
simple yet elegant.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.360
And what is this?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.520
Did the creative director
quit their job?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.880
What a waste!

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.685
Goodness!

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.720
The creative director
just quit this morning.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.080
Who invited Apo?

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.320
I did.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.640
Have a seat.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.480
What's the meeting about?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.360
Siao Tawan Group's
100th anniversary party.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.520
A party?

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.080
Yes, our top business partners
are guests,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.640
and Mother has always been the host.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.240
I invited Apo because

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.000
I want him to be part of this event.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.360
Darling,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.480
Apo's never worked on
an event this big before.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.880
If it falls through

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.240
or someone quits last minute,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.640
we'll look like fools.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.120
I think...

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.440
Didn't you want fresh ideas, Milady?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.640
So, here's Apo.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.040
He majored in art.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.120
He's got an eye for art, tons of ideas,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.480
and he's our son-in-law.

00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:17.160
Looks aside,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.140
he's got a lot of experience.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.000
Please let him help.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.560
So, we're good then, Milady?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.400
All good, then.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.680
I'll try to hear him out

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.040
and we'll see

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.320
if it's a hit or miss.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.360
Ugh...

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.440
Is this good enough?

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.760
I'd better ask AI.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.760
You're better than AI, you know?

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.760
You've done lots of things
in the other world,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.760
and you handle things well.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.460
But...

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.840
I've never done anything this grand.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.280
And even the Prime Minister is joining.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.440
If I make a mistake,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.040
I'm afraid...

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.000
your mom will hate me even more.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.600
Hm...

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.320
How about...

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.440
If you need help,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.200
I'll be your AI assistant.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.032
Greetings, Apo.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.120
How can I help you?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.360
Alright...

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.334
Gosh,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.760
you've got so much on your plate,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.440
and you still want to help me?

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.200
How about this?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.060
If you want to help me,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.960
can you tell me
how to win your mother's heart?

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.680
Hm...

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.160
Honestly,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.960
my mom is very kind

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.200
and reasonable,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.240
but she acts this way

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.280
because she doesn't like the old Apo.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.440
That's the big issue.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.680
I think...

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.680
If she sees

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.240
that you're not the same Apo,

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.600
she'll open up to you.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.860
What?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.960
How do you know I want a hug?

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.720
Did you just read my mind?

00:07:45.686 --> 00:07:47.246
Maybe I'm just...

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.960
getting to know you better.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.600
You'll see.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.760
This party's gonna live up to
His Serene Highness' reputation.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.160
And...

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.080
I'll also win your mom's heart.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.600
For this party,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.400
winning her heart isn't your only job

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.800
you've got one more thing...

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.160
to do as my fiancé.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.960
Hm?

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.720
As is tradition at the annual party,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.920
Father and Mother
usually dance together

00:08:53.293 --> 00:08:56.293
to officially open the dance floor.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.160
This song?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.480
That's beautiful.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.480
It's Jenny Kim's song.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.320
She's one of
the greatest violinists ever.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.240
Mother is her biggest fan.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.840
Even though Jenny Kim
already announced her retirement,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.600
Mother still chooses this song
to open the dance floor every year.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.280
More importantly,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.880
this year,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.640
Father wants us to take the dance floor

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.080
instead of them.

00:09:34.422 --> 00:09:35.222
Huh?

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.960
This is to mark a new era
for Siao Tawan Group.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.760
Uh...

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.920
Dancing?

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.920
But...

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.000
But I don't know how to dance.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.320
I've only seen that in dramas
where they go...

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.680
"Cha-cha-cha!"
Something like this.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.240
And they go...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.920
Have you seen those?

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.040
I don't think it'll be like that.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.960
Don't worry about it.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.240
All you have to do is follow me.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.960
I'll take the lead.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.160
Our hands are gonna touch, right?

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.720
What about reading minds?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.320
About that...

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.520
I got ahead of you.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.280
Come on.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.520
Without these gloves,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.120
I'd be hearing a love confession

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.120
instead of the song.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.040
You're delulu!

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.520
Who even confesses in their mind?

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.400
I'd use my words...

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.200
for you to hear.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.840
Come on.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.620
Let's...

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.360
begin our practice.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.322
We'll start with the basics
for beginners.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.680
I'll count...

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.920
One,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.140
two,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.320
three,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.320
touch.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.800
One,

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.580
two,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.240
three...

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.760
Now, turn around.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.320
One...

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.400
Flick.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.160
That's beautiful. Good job.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.800
What's the capacity for this venue?

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.920
Up to 120 guests, sir.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.120
Can we change the color of these lights?

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.840
We can.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.240
- You can?
- We sure can.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.920
As for the photo booth,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.120
can you

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.960
arrange that for us?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.860
- Ow!
- Hey!

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.960
Hey...

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.001
I was gonna say

00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:26.200
that you're a fast learner.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.440
The theme for Siao Tawan Group's
100th anniversary party is...

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.440
'Hello, the Universe.'

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.200
What is that?

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.800
Are we in a pageant or what?

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.000
That's not what it is.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.720
Uh...

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.920
Please let him finish
his presentation, Mother.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.120
Our universe

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.000
formed as all matter
came together, right?

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.580
The Sun,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.920
the Moon,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440
the Earth,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.040
millions of stars,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.320
and even us humans
are all part of the universe.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.600
I believe that
a century of Siao Tawan Group

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.760
was not the work of one man,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.760
but the effort of everyone united.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.680
And that's similar to
the stars in the universe

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.680
uniting to make Siao Tawan Group
become successful and renowned,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.080
like a highly honored universe.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.800
This is, 'Hello, the Universe.'

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.080
Pretty words, zero point.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.120
Awesome!

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.680
I like it.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.760
The theme of the grand universe.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.520
But...

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.480
To be honest,

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.920
I'm not quite seeing the point.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.680
Apart from being classic yet fresh,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.160
simple yet elegant,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.320
we can add some fun to the event

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.320
by letting everyone dress up
however they like,

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.000
which makes it very inclusive.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.960
If you want to dress up
as a Miss Universe contestant,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
feel free to do so, Mother.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.360
What do you think, Mother?

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.440
Well...

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.920
It's not as bad as I imagined.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160
But I feel like it's missing something.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.480
What is it?

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.200
Uh...

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.280
Why did you want to see me?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.200
I'm telling you, I'm busy today.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.520
What a perfect time.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.360
I was free and bored.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.040
So, so coming here to hang out is...

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.640
pretty nice.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.640
Any thoughts on this costume?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.480
Well,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.160
it's alright.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.720
You in this costume

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.240
are pretty cute.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.320
What's with that smile?

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.120
I know...

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.440
You think I'm cute, don't you?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360
Are you nuts?

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.400
You can read my mind, huh?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.400
Hm...

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.320
But it'd be even cuter

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.360
if you knew how to wear it properly.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.120
Here,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.040
go ahead.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.580
Wanna come to the company's
anniversary party with me?

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.380
Why are you inviting me?

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.360
I'm neither a partner in
Siao Tawan Group like Tor's family,

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.840
nor His Excellency's fiancé, like Apo.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.840
You'd be my guest, of course.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.960
M.R. Chan's guest?

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.640
What kind of guest?

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.480
A friend?

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.960
Or...

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.080
That way, you can wear
this costume with me.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.440
I'll have to think about it.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.800
Hold up.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.360
Let's go have some ice cream.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600
My treat.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.840
Hey...

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.680
Wanna take a break for a meal?

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.600
Let me work on this for a moment.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.240
It's missing something,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.880
but I can't figure out what.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.000
We have food,

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.840
a banquet hall,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.320
and a playlist...

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.003
What about a stage performance?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.880
It's Jenny Kim's song.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.720
She's one of
the greatest violinists ever.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.640
Jenny Kim!

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.360
Jenny Kim.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.920
Right.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.240
But...

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.760
she's stopped
accepting gigs for years now.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.320
It's fine.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.760
No matter what...

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.520
could I try reaching out to her first?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.520
Do you know how I can do that?

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.000
Hm...

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.760
Actually,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.560
I guess I do.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.080
She comes to our hotel
for a spa service every week.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.320
Seize the chance to speak with her.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.040
Uh, Ms. Jenny?

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.000
Bonjour, Apo.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.800
Long time no see.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.120
Does Apo know her?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.480
Hello.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.760
We really haven't
seen each other in a while.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.260
How are you, Ms. Jenny?

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.380
I do miss you a lot.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.320
Miss me, you said?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.282
After how badly
you embarrassed me last time?

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.720
Uh...

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.680
I...

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.960
I'm really sorry for that.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.480
I genuinely didn't mean

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.680
to offend you, Ms. Jenny.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.080
I was also in a car accident,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.450
and my memory isn't back yet.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.320
Oh...

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.000
I'll keep up with that excuse.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.880
I'll help you get your memory back.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520
Apo...

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:36.920
Uh...

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.880
Was I really that evil to you?

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:39.960
Nope.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.800
I totally exaggerated.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.440
Let's just say that, last time...

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.560
you absolutely embarrassed me.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:47.960
I didn't...

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.640
Shh!

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.880
Hush!

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.240
Just seeing your face
already ruins my day.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.600
Hey...

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.160
Are you massaging or tickling me?

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.440
Yeah...

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.240
Just like that!

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.680
Do it hard,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.120
and I'll give you a fat tip!

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.200
Can you help me with something
instead of just giving me tips?

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.720
What's up with your voice, sweetie?

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.280
Are you okay?

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.590
So, what should I help you with

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.120
instead of the tips?

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.880
So, yesterday...

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.960
I got to give Lady Pripprao
a massage,

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.720
and all she talked about

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.680
was how much she wants you to perform
at Siao Tawan Group's anniversary party.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.080
And I just thought...

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.280
if I could make her dream come true,

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.560
it would be such an honor.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.360
But I haven't accepted gigs for years.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.280
I know that,

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.960
but that's all

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.080
Lady Pripprao kept talking about.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040
Argh!

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.240
Time to FaceTime Piggybooboo!

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.880
No!

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.160
I mean...

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.520
This massage session
isn't finished.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.600
Let me just FaceTime my cat!

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.720
No, you can't!

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.360
Apo!

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.360
Uh...

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840
Apo!

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.120
What are you up to now?

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.160
Haven't you had enough
after all this time?

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.640
I stopped accepting gigs

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.080
because of you!

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.680
You were the one

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.280
who made me look like a clown!

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.680
I'm really sorry.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.840
It was my fault...

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.800
What did you say?

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.880
"Sorry"?

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.200
Uh...

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.080
I'm truly sorry

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.600
about this and everything
that happened before.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.880
Apo said sorry...

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.240
I don't know how I can make it up to you

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.440
or how many times I have to apologize.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.960
If there's anything I can do,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.840
I...

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.280
I will do it.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.560
"Anything," you said?

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.680
The guy who dressed up as a clown

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.680
at the amusement park that day...

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.840
I looked him up.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.920
He actually worked for Siao Tawan Group!

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.400
But there was no quarreling
between him and Mr. Apo.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.240
Therefore,

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.880
he is definitely not a suspect
in this case.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.640
What about the threatening letter
sent to the Yues' house?

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.760
The messenger was just there
to deliver the letter,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.400
and there weren't any fingerprints

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.520
to identify the writer.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.520
Aren't you curious
about the blood on the letter?

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.000
That was merely a blood-like liquid.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.680
Hey!

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.800
Aw!

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.560
Suriya,

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.760
I really miss you.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.240
What are you doing? I miss you so much.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.600
Do you miss me?

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.200
How's your day going?

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.080
Lady Pripprao sent Butler Francois
to spy on us again?!

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.120
No need to be this extra.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.680
He's just here
to talk about something with me.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.560
Then...

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.360
I'd better get going.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.120
I wouldn't want to interrupt
your alone time.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.520
Bye-bye!

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.840
Whoa...

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.680
Or do I need to bring
Butler Francois back

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.720
to keep an eye on us?

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.160
Hm?

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.160
Hey...

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:24.840
Listen,

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.280
I have some great news.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.320
What is it?

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.240
Jenny Kim agreed
to perform at the party.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.080
Whoa!

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.280
Really?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.840
Mother will be so thrilled.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.480
I have to give her a call now.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.520
Mother was very happy

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.560
that you could get
Jenny Kim to perform.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.840
I'm sure she's secretly
given you extra credit.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.080
Aren't you happy?

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.470
What's with that look on your face?

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.080
Uh...

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.280
I'm very happy.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.440
Fine, I'll do it.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.240
I have one condition.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.720
Don't let me see your face
at the party.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.680
Hey...

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.680
Hm?

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.880
What if I don't go to the party?

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.360
Why?

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.520
Are you alright?

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.240
I...

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.200
My dancing skills
still need a lot of work.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.480
I'm afraid I might embarrass you
in front of everyone.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.360
That's no big deal.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.240
How about we practice again

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.480
to really perfect it?

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.080
Come on.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.720
Hey, I don't have my gloves on!

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.120
Then...

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.400
How about this? I'll...

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.280
I'll dance for you.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.120
Okay, we can do that.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.400
I think you kinda got it.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.520
- Ow, ow!
- Whoa!

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.079
- Are you alright?
- Hey, don't come close!

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.380
Ouch!

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.080
Why?

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.280
It might dislocate even more.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.400
Ow...

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.320
Just go get some help for me.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.560
Alright...

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.640
- Ouch...
- Does it hurt badly?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.240
Very badly!

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.440
I don't think I can walk.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.880
I guess you'll have to...

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.240
apologize to His Serene Highness
and the lady for me.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.080
- Apo,
- Ouch...

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.400
it's just a fall.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.640
You can use a wheelchair,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.680
and I'll push it for you.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.640
Then,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.040
it's going to be a problem for you.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.680
Also,

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.480
it's gonna get in the way of the guests.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.080
I don't want Lady Pripprao to think

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.330
I'm more of a burden
than I already am.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.280
What are you even thinking?

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.880
- Whoa! A gecko!
- Whoa, what?

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.640
- Argh!
- What?

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.880
- A gecko!
- What's happening?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.000
Ugh, you damn gecko!

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.200
You ruined my plan.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.920
What plan?

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.000
Uh...

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.080
A plan to...

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.160
To...

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.440
A plan to get clingy with you.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.880
After all,

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.360
you want me to carry you home?

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.880
- Come here.
- Uh...

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.600
Huh?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.360
Maybe not...

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.680
What do you mean by that?

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.760
Wait!

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.680
Hold up!

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.280
What's going on with you?

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.640
Just pretend I have COVID-19,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.560
and I won't have to go to the party!

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.040
Hey!

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.440
Are you all set?

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.040
Ya!

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.400
We're in trouble!

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.120
Hey!

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.600
What's going on?

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.640
Don't come close!

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.680
- Huh?
- You'll catch it!

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.240
Look!

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.400
Are you pregnant?

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.040
What?

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.760
Can men get pregnant in this universe?

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.880
No, we can't!

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.400
That's why I'm shocked.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.560
I've got COVID.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.840
What is it?

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.160
Damn, I forgot to check on it.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.600
There's no COVID in this universe?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.200
I have a fever.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.160
Here, let me...

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.480
Stay back!

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.760
You could catch a fever

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.880
and not make it to the party.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.560
Just leave, Your Excellency.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.400
You'll be late...

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.080
Okay.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.840
If you need anything,
give me a call, okay?

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.620
Thank you.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.480
- Father, Mother.
- Oh.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.240
Dear son.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:00.880
Hello.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.640
Well,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.520
where is Apo?

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.240
Why is he leaving my son alone like this?

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.800
Apo is sick, Mother.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.920
He's resting at home.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.040
Sick?

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.440
Is he okay?

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.520
Oh!

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.880
Is he actually pretending to be sick

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.480
and skipping out on his duty
to stay home?

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.320
Or did he overdo it for the event

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.880
and now he's sick?

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.360
Ya, once you get home,
take him to the doctor.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.080
Of course, Father.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.200
What a shame.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.880
This is the perfect chance
to introduce him to our partners.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.680
And who are you
gonna open the floor with, Ya?

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.640
Here comes the real star of the show.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.000
- Come here, dear.
- Hi, Mother.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.320
- Hi, Father.
- Yi!

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.880
Aw, your costume is awesome.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.640
Oops,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.400
yours matches Ya's.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.720
It's a coincidence, Mother.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.800
Your outfit is absolutely gorgeous.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.840
Thank you, dear!

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.520
Congratulations again on the party.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.960
Thank you so much.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.240
Yi, stay close to me,

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.720
so you can open
the dance floor, okay?

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.880
Rest up and get well soon.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.120
Call me immediately
if you don't feel well, alright?

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.000
I'll rush back home to you.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.720
Okay, have fun at the party.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.520
It turned out beautiful.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.680
Too bad you couldn't see it yourself.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.540
I wish you were here with me.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.680
[A peek at Siao Tawan Group's
100th Anniversary Party]

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.080
Hello, Po.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:47.800
Hey!

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.800
What are you guys?

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.720
We're dressed up as condiments today

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.280
to spice up the event.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.080
And how's that
related to 'Hello, the Universe'?

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.080
Wait,

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.160
condiments don't exist
in this universe?

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.000
Anyway, where are you now?

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.600
- Aren't you coming?
- Yeah.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.000
Uh...

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.120
I...

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.520
I'm not going.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.560
I'm...

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.160
I'm sick.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.640
That's cap!

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.960
Since when can a sick person
be in control of coughing?

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.520
Don't think you're slick!

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.360
You came up with the concept,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.720
- so how could you just bail?
- Mm!

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.520
If something goes wrong,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200
who will be responsible?

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.560
You're right...

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.880
Now that you got it,
get your ass over here!

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.720
But I...

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.280
Guys!

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.320
Got another one of those costumes?

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.840
What would you like, bestie?

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.040
Say the word and it's yours.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.440
Whoa!

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.120
Tor,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.680
I told you
I wanted the Apollo spaceship,

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.920
not a tomato!

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.320
Come on, trust me.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.600
You gotta be outstanding

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.840
to stand out.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.080
Right?

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.720
Whatever.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.360
But...

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.040
Don't tell anyone

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.280
that I came here.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.960
Why?

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.310
You're the host,

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.560
not a trespasser.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.960
I've got a surprise
for the end of the event.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.480
I see.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.680
Alright.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.800
Got it.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.960
Don't breathe a word to anyone.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.760
Hi, there, Mr. Hot Sauce.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.320
Don't you laugh at me...

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.400
My bad.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.600
What about the costume I gave you?

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.440
I thought we'd match.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.640
I did want to wear that,

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.520
but Torphong

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.520
forced me to wear this.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.120
I think it suits you, though.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:18.960
How?

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.820
Well...

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.360
It's hot,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.360
spicy,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
and it's heating me up.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.700
Looks good on you.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.280
You look cute in a different way.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.200
You talk nonsense, you know?

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.960
It's the truth.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.640
It's giving a different vibe.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.240
Next up,

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.160
please welcome M.C. Jakkawarn

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.040
to give the opening speech.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.480
You can do it.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.880
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.240
Tonight is a special occasion

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.040
as we gather to celebrate the success

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.060
of Siao Tawan Group on its centenary.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.680
Other than that,

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.840
I would like to announce
the beginning of the new era

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.520
with the biggest
mega project in a century.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:39.720
I hereby entrust my son, Suriya,

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.520
with the responsibility
for the entirety of the project.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.320
Now,

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.720
I won't take any more of your time.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.560
Please enjoy the party!

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.920
Thank you!

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.040
Please give a round of applause
to M.C. Jakkawarn!

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.920
In this section,
I would like everyone to...

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.040
If the food at the party
isn't to your taste,

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.800
I'll make you something.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.360
I invited you

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.760
as my guest,

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.000
so make yourself comfortable tonight.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.300
I'll be your host.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.040
As long as it's edible.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.000
Whoa!

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.520
You're judging me?

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.080
Wait and see.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.160
I'll make you an omelet.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.560
It's gonna taste good, I swear.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.400
Just trust me.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.300
Okay.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.880
Go ahead.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.560
Aren't you afraid
it's gonna spill on your costume?

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.640
Shit!

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:27.800
Here,

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.000
it's called 'Are You an Omelet?

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.640
'Cause You Stir My Heart,'

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.880
my secret recipe.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.860
Hm?

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.640
Just keep it a secret, then.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.680
I can use everything
in this kitchen, right?

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.520
Mm.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.680
Sure.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.600
How's that?

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.070
Here.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.120
Try it.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.360
Take a bite!

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.480
It's good!

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.440
Take this.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.400
Here.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.800
Uh...

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.200
Just finish the rest of it.
I'm full.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.360
I'm sorry.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:10.720
Huh?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.840
I invited you here
and ended up making you uncomfortable.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.480
To be honest,

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.280
I shouldn't have pushed you to come.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.200
Hey,

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.320
you're actually a pretty good host.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.120
For serving a burned omelet?

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:32.800
Mm!

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.960
You silly!

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.960
You're making me feel
a lot more comfortable.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.040
Thank you.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.720
Come here.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.600
You eat like a baby.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.600
He's kinda adorable like this.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.240
Thank you.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.290
[100th Siao Tawan:
Hello, the Universe]

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.360
Alright, ladies and gentlemen.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.280
It's time for tonight's exclusive show.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:30.040
Please give it up for Jenny Kim!

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.610
Mabuhay!

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:38.450
Hello, the Universe!

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.680
Wow, it's like
they were made for each other,

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.520
M.R. Suriya and Yi!

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.760
- Mm!
- Exactly,

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.480
His Excellency's ex
looks like such an angel.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.040
He's perfect, isn't he?

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:23.920
You're right.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.480
If that were Apo,

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.280
he'd be all aggressive and mad.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:34.160
Honestly, the party
is ten times better without him.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.120
Yeah.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.040
Hey, I heard that

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.720
Apo once hired Jenny Kim,

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.640
and she ended up getting kicked out!

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.880
That was harsh!

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.530
- Yeah, it really was.
- Mm!

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.680
- So harsh!
- He's nasty.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.640
- Yeah.
- Right?

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.920
Hey, Po.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.440
This is my secret recipe punch.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.520
I'm spilling all the secrets, bestie.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.160
Wanna try?

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.260
Whoa... Po, slow down!

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.920
It has alcohol.

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.840
Take it easy.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.840
Po!

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.200
Wait...

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.440
Oh, you drank it all.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.800
Please come in, Jenny Kim.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.680
Thank you
for taking the time to perform!

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.120
I'm absolutely thrilled

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.910
to see you live on stage again.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.560
- It's such an honor.
- Right.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.520
I was hesitant at first

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.840
about accepting the gig,

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.240
but seeing what Apo sacrificed...

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.720
I gave in.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.120
Well, what did Apo do

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.040
for you to agree?

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.680
Honestly,

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.600
it wasn't complicated at all.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.440
I only told him that I'd come

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.440
as long as he wasn't there.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.080
But it was just a joke.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.960
I didn't think he'd actually do it.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.280
- Oh...
- I must say,

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.920
you have to give him
a medal for the best son-in-law

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.160
because he was willing to do anything

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.520
just for me to perform here.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880
Right.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.480
Thank you again.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.680
But let's get some rest over there.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.520
- Sure.
- Yes.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.520
Can I ask you for a selfie, too?

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.960
I may not be great at cooking,

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.960
but when it comes to cocktails,
I'm the best.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.880
And what is this called?

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.640
Super Moon, the one you like.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.160
Uh...

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.200
How did you find out my secret recipe?

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.200
I came up with it myself.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.040
Hm...

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.560
I just went with my gut.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.120
Does it taste exactly like yours?

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.680
That means I'm pretty good at guessing.

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.640
What about the name?

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.240
I also came up with that.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.640
That was just a lucky guess?

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.220
Uh...

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.200
or how nice I am to you guys,

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.840
it won't change how you feel about Apo.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.080
You know what's funny?

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.240
At first, I was so happy

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.760
that I got to live in this body.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.360
Honestly,

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.760
I'm Apo in...

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.120
Ow, what?!

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.760
The new Apo is nothing like
the one you knew.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.120
The old Apo might've been bad to you,

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.680
but the new one

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.160
just puts a smile on your face.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.520
He was the person behind this party.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.760
He got just a wink of sleep

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.920
to plan this party for us all.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.480
He did everything

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.400
so your favorite, Jenny Kim,
could be part of it.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.080
He turned a boring event

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.440
into one that you can all enjoy,

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.260
even though it meant

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.080
he needed to stay out of the party.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.800
In fact,

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.160
he's behind many other good things.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.720
If you come to realize
who he is from the inside,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.280
your feelings about him
might change just like mine did.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.400
There's one more thing

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.200
we still haven't done.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.080
I'm sorry...

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.350
I almost ruined the party.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.800
It came out great.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.800
People can't stop talking about it.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.640
As for me,

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.080
I just wanted to shout to everyone

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.960
that this perfect event

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.200
was your creation,

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.560
Phopthorn.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.240
You just...

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.240
What did you call me?

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.400
Phopthorn.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.040
Can you call me that again?

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.120
Phopthorn.

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.320
It must've been so painful

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.480
that everyone only sees you as Apo.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.440
I know

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.600
that sometimes

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.360
you don't wanna be Apo in disguise.

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:05.960
From now on,

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.640
even if everyone else
sees you as Apo,

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.840
to me,

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.760
you're Phopthorn.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.960
If we don't resist this temptation,

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.480
where will we end up tonight?

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.240
You know I heard that, right?

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.360
Phopthorn...

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.040
I love you.
