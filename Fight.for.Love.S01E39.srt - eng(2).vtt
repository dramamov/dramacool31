Wei Yun,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.110
how dare you

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.320
enter Qizhou alone!

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.080
I've said it.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.240
You're just like Su Can.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.620
Killing you would be easy as well.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.520
I came

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.560
to take your head.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.040
Imperial guards, listen:

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.630
tonight,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.000
anyone who kills Wei Yun

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.820
will be rewarded 10,000 taels of gold.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.070
Yes!

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.680
Who are you?

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.000
(Queen Mother's Order)

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.140
By the Queen Mother's order,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.790
with this token, Gongsun Lan,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.150
City Lord of Yun,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.150
may enter the Palace at any time
to protect her.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.750
Open the gates.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.750
This token represents

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.440
the Queen Mother.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.720
Open the gates now.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.040
Open the palace gates.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.880
Yes.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.880
Once I lure Zhao Yue away,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.790
you can enter the Palace.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.070
Stop.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.070
Stop fighting.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.400
Stop.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.190
With the token here,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.520
don't you dare act rashly.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.100
The Queen Mother orders

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.440
that the Yun troops escort
the Great Sui delegation

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.380
out of the Palace.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.500
Anyone who dares to stop us

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.190
(Queen Mother's Order)
will be executed.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.630
Any objections?

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.840
The Yun troops will escort you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.780
back to the posthouse.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.280
Go now.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.910
Where is Wei Yun?

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.190
Young Marquis Wei

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.540
lured Zhao Yue out of the Palace.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.320
He'll manage to escape.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840
He's instructed

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.880
that you wait for him at the posthouse.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.880
What about you?

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.640
Yes.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.480
Breaking into the Palace
with so many people

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.260
is no small crime.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.880
You're worried about me?

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.910
Rest assured.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.880
I'll petition the Queen Mother tomorrow.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.790
After today, the Queen Mother

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.280
and the King are on the brink of battle.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.550
She will trust me.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.110
Yun troops, listen:

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.210
Escort the Great Sui delegation

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.500
back to the posthouse.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.880
Yes.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.940
(Qiyang Silk and Satin)

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.390
Close the gates.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.840
All the Yun troops are waiting here.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.570
At your command,

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.860
they will clear the way for you.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.240
You're hiding?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.110
In Qizhou,

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.430
where can you hide from me?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.680
Everyone,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.990
surround the entire street.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.230
Not a single rat may escape.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.270
Yes.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.830
Open the gates!

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.880
Wei Yun,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.210
if you do not show yourself,

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.720
I will burn

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.600
the entire street.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.790
I want to see

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.670
if you can escape

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.400
a sea of fire.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.980
Come out.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.640
My people

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.600
should willingly make sacrifices for me.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.960
You should be grateful

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.020
that the God of War from Great Sui
will die with you.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.150
Light the fire.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.510
Your Majesty!

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.630
Your Majesty!

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.760
Instead of staying with Changming,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.640
why are you here?

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.520
Your Majesty,

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.200
she suddenly has severe abdominal pain.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.380
The situation is critical.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.480
I'm afraid...

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.510
I'm afraid...

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.040
Return immediately.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.820
(Yifen Hall)

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.230
What should we do?

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.040
What to do?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.040
If blame falls on us,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.110
what will happen to us?

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.350
If the King blames us...

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.780
- Your Majesty.
- What happened?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.910
Your Majesty,

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.230
the Consort of Mei took a tonic

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.720
that contained oleander,

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.870
so she

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.080
lost the child.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.430
Why would there be oleander?

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.790
She took the tonic

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.470
sent by Noble Consort Chen.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.040
Fortunately,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.350
her life is not in danger.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.830
Everyone, get out.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.430
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.680
Changming,

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.720
it's my fault.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.470
I failed to protect our child.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.600
Rest assured.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.870
We will have another child.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.760
You know my health the best.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:06.910
It was hard for me

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.280
to conceive.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.670
I'll never have

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.720
a second child in my life.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.070
No.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.600
I'll find the best physicians
in North Qi

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.910
and ensure you have a second child.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.550
Noble Consort Chen told me this morning

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.960
that she has long received your favor.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.520
She will have

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.710
your child sooner or later.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.550
Why care about mine?

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.160
You lied to me.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.000
Zhao Yue,

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.000
how many things are you hiding

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.240
from me?

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.200
Changming,

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.310
I had no choice.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.150
No choice?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.880
You had no choice but to marry her

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.590
and sleep with her.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.190
Now, she killed my child,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.790
but you can do nothing,

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.190
because you have no choice.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.630
Zhao Yue,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.830
you are a coward.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.640
You keep saying

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.550
you'll make me the Queen

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.550
and my child the Crown Prince,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.640
yet you have achieved none of it.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.910
You've been under Yunyang's control.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.240
Without her,

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.160
you are nothing.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.480
With a father like you,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.830
even if this child were born,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.880
he would not live long,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.950
because you cannot protect him at all.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.590
The moment he was born,

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:57.950
he would face the Queen Mother

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.120
and every threat

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.240
in the Palace.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.880
He would be surrounded by enemies.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.270
Zhao Yue,

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.040
he'd become another you.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.910
The Queen Mother was right.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.550
He was baseborn.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.760
Someone has killed your child.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.550
You cannot protect me.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.240
You cannot protect us.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.280
Our child

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.280
has died for no reason.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.120
No.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.790
I said I would protect you,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.550
so I will.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.430
Guards,

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.400
deliver my decree.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.710
The daughter of the City Lord of Xuan

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.190
killed a royal child.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.290
The crime is unforgivable.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.890
Her entire clan shall be exterminated.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.960
Yes.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.690
I will go and kill Noble Consort Chen

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.430
to avenge our child.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.670
I said it before.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.000
In any battle I fight,

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.550
I have never lost.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.000
The weather is dry.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.820
(Qizhou Posthouse)
Be careful with fire.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.360
Hurry and help me with this.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.510
Come on.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.270
Gently, gently.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.200
What is this?

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.240
Yu,

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.670
stop worrying.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:58.950
Yun is amazing.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:11:59.790
He will be fine.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:00.910
Exactly.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.790
Wei Yun is the God of War.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.670
Zhao Yue can do nothing

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.760
to him.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.910
Right.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.200
No, I need to find him.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.310
- Yu.
- Wait.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.310
- Yu.
- Wait.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.670
Yu, wait.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.760
Why stop me?

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.640
Don't stop me.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.670
Yun instructed us.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.400
We can't let you leave now.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.240
- If he returns...
- And you're not here...

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.080
What should we do?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.840
Then...

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.150
Yu.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.120
I'm back.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.160
- You're back.
- You're back.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.030
What's wrong?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.240
Are you alright?

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:21.510
Don't worry.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.790
With Gongsun Lan supporting me,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.080
nothing will happen.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.710
Who could be so cruel

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.560
as to kill the Eldest Princess's child?

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.950
I fear a change is coming

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.070
to the North Qi royals.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.040
It already has.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.710
I just returned from the Palace.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.310
Zhao Yue has executed
Noble Consort Chen.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.750
Soon,

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.430
her entire clan

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.280
will be put to death.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.760
The Eldest Princess said
she wouldn't leave

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.950
and would find a way to help us.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.360
I never expected this

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.880
to be her method.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.600
What she has done

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.200
is for the delegation

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.040
and Great Sui.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.520
We will never let her efforts
go to waste.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.400
Zhao Yue intends to bring chaos

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.310
to the world.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.910
Only by killing him

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.210
can we save the Eldest Princess.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.480
To overthrow Zhao Yue,

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.120
we need other City Lords' support.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.580
Gongsun Lan and I will rescue

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.040
the City Lord of Xuan.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.750
The one who hates Zhao Yue most

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.520
should be him now.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.120
Spread what happened tonight.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.340
We can use

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.710
Mr. Gongsun's intelligence network

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:19.830
to tell other City Lords

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.190
that Zhao Yue intends to start a war
with Great Sui.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.200
With the people's resentment
against him,

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.400
we can gather all forces

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.860
and make the City Lords rebel.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.790
This is the game changer.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.480
This may be our last chance.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.360
The Sixteen Cities lie north of Qizhou.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.240
If the City Lords march toward Qizhou,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.670
Zhao Yue will surely flee south.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.560
Shilan and I have arranged

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.200
for him to station troops at the border

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.360
as reinforcements.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:43.840
Tonight, Zhao Yue decided

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.530
to exterminate
Noble Consort Chen's clan.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.530
It will only strengthen

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:47.380
our cause

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.280
and accelerate his loss of support.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.520
I'm good

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:53.510
at spreading news.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.760
Leave it to me.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.270
Good.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.130
Where is the Fragrance House in Qizhou?

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.710
I'm also good

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.550
at spreading news.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.590
What's wrong?

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.070
I'm serious.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.340
Are you worrying
about the Eldest Princess?

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.590
She's so proud.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.400
For Great Sui,

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.520
she has given so much.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.350
With both nations in turmoil,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.140
someone must shoulder these things,

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.830
or our descendants

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.070
will shed even more blood.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.550
If we do not want them to bear this,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.720
then we

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.680
must pave the path

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.720
to peace first.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.360
Yes.

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.150
As long as the path is lit,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.830
we can still follow the light

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.520
amid misleading affairs.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.790
The path to peace

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.280
is also for ourselves.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.790
We'll return to Huajing safely together.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.280
Though you're young,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.520
you can bear national burdens.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.480
Since I can bear the burden

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.400
for Great Sui,

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.520
I can also bear the burden for us.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.520
After tomorrow,

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.070
we'll get the outcome.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:23.420
(Sui)

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.480
Commander Lu asked me

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.320
to send these.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.040
He said

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.200
they could help you recover.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.110
Do not stop.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.950
Keep training.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.960
Commander Lu said

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.170
this is used to stabilize

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.540
the bones in your leg.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.920
He said sitting for too long

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.110
may cause the bones to shift.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.480
What are these?

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.240
Well.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.520
I do not know, either.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.310
Commander Lu said

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.520
it's used to stimulate
the acupoints on the sole

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.480
to clear the meridians in the leg.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:03.630
General Chu,

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.480
shall I help you up to try it?

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.000
These things he sent

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.390
are truly novel.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.760
Keep them for now.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.760
Thank him for me.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.520
Greetings, General Chu.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.760
This medicine was bestowed

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.760
by the Crown Prince.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.760
It will help your leg heal.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.350
The Crown Princess

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.390
asked me to deliver it without delay.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.120
The Crown Princess?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.390
You don't know?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.630
Miss Song has agreed

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.150
to marry the Crown Prince.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.920
The wedding will be held soon.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.600
The Crown Prince sent someone

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.220
to bring her into the Palace
this morning

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.390
to choose her wedding attire.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.070
She should be arriving at the Palace.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.550
I must report back,

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.110
so I will not stay longer.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.880
Tuantuan is going to become
the Crown Princess.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.760
I want you to help me test him.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.800
In the past,

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.040
you were always chasing after him.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.260
You even went to Fengling alone

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:55.920
because of him,

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.070
but I still don't know

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.000
about his thoughts.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:02.680
Test him?

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.440
How will you test him?

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.590
Linyang once said

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:08.960
that when he stands up,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.920
he will come to see me.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.550
I can see he has feelings for me.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.000
What if he never

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.970
stands up in this life?

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.880
Qingping,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.630
I just want to know

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.040
if he truly likes you

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.720
enough to give up

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.630
everything for you.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.120
Otherwise,

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.920
how could I entrust the one I cherish

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.110
to someone else?

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.090
- Your Highness.
- Enough.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.040
I've made up my mind.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.620
I am the Crown Prince.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:41.230
This time,

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.110
you must listen to me.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.200
(Linyang,)

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.760
(you will come, right?)

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.430
Tuantuan,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.150
didn't we have an agreement?

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.310
When I can stand up,

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.000
I'll go to see you myself.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.520
Why did you

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.550
break your word

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.070
and give up first?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.000
I can accept that you love someone else,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:33.580
but I do not understand

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.590
why you would abandon

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.590
your aspirations and freedom.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.430
You once said

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.030
you refused to be confined
within palace walls.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:47.790
I hope you achieve

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.140
what you desire more than anyone.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.680
If you walk

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.510
through these palace gates today,

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.830
you'll be breaking

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.000
your wings.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.280
Tuantuan,

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.520
why are you doing this?

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.430
Tuantuan...

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.630
Linyang,

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:43.680
I am sorry.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.630
I did not mean to deceive you.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.310
Your Highness,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.830
did you hear

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:09.830
Linyang's answer?

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.040
Did he pass the test?

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.030
General Chu, please do not blame her.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.000
It was my idea
to have Qingping cooperate.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.840
Qingping

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.960
was the first girl I ever truly liked.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.360
So,

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:38.630
I cannot easily

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.960
entrust her to another man.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.720
I know she likes you,

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.910
and she

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.630
has given so much for it.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.070
Everyone in Huajing

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.790
knows what kind of man you are,

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.390
but only you know

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:01.830
whether you truly

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.470
like Qingping

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.550
and how far

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.960
you would go for her.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:18.470
Tuantuan,

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.190
I'm sorry.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.390
Before, I was not steadfast enough.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:29.480
Sorry about that.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.280
The old me

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.350
was like a dead tree, clinging to life,

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.040
preferring to stay in the shadows,

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.240
watching everything in silence.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.110
Tuantuan's appearance

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.240
gave me hope again.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.240
She made me realize

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.630
that everything can be pacified.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.010
What is hard to pacify

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
is the human heart.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.150
In the future,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.480
whatever happens,

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.150
however hard it may be,

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:31.310
I shall never fail you.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.320
Now,

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.550
I can finally be at ease.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.000
General Chu,

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.630
the situation of the peace talks
is unclear.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.680
If disputes arise again,

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.440
Great Sui will still need you to fight.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.080
So,

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.310
even if Qingping hadn't come to me,

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.110
I'd still send the medicine to you.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.480
May you recover soon.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.150
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:28.390
Tuantuan,

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.950
the goldfinch

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.070
you once set free

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.350
should now be carefree.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.870
From that day, I already knew

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.440
that the future you hoped for

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.280
would not include me.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.760
Since I truly like you,

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.960
I hope you achieve what you desire.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.800
This Imperial Palace

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.830
was never your tree to perch on.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.230
Go.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.440
Live the life you want.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.040
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:12.620
(Qingzhou City)

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.520
Please work with me

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.390
to accomplish another great task.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.390
I have petitioned the Emperor

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.350
to secretly go to North Qi

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.000
and assist Yu.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.720
I should have known.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.590
How could you let Ms. Chu

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.000
go to North Qi alone?

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.470
Yun,

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.110
what is the great task

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.720
you just mentioned?

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.520
As the General of the West,

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:42.880
you're in charge of Qingzhou
and Fengling.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.150
Station troops in Qingzhou.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.960
Qingzhou is closer to Qizhou.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.630
If anything goes wrong,

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.040
support me in time.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.460
(Qizhou Posthouse)

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.180
(Zhao Yue is not virtuous.)

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.040
Here.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:23.070
Zhao Yue is immoral.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.440
He must be punished by all.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.020
(Zhao Yue is immoral, unfit to rule.)

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:33.830
Finally! That's satisfying.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:34.670
Exactly.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240
Well written.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:40.650
He must be punished by all.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.940
(Yingzhou)

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.790
Here you go.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.630
Thank you.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:51.710
It's nothing.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.620
(The City Lord of Yingzhou
has left for Qizhou.)

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.540
(Yingzhou)

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.520
- Here.
- I think

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.360
this color is good.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.560
How nice.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.820
(The City Lord of Yan is ready.)

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.780
(Yan City)

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.620
(Qizhou)

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.480
- Your kebabs.
- Thanks.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.320
Goodbye.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.400
(The City Lord of Huqiu
will attack Qizhou.)

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.260
(Huqiu)

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.860
(Grilled meat)

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.140
(The City Lord of Wuzhou)

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.660
(Baoxin, Bai City)

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.900
(Xuan City)

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.910
Yes.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.460
(City Lord of Xuan)

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.080
Gongsun Lan.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.390
Sit.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.830
You came by royal order
to kill me, right?

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.830
Act now.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.830
As long as I live,

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.960
I will find every way

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.200
to avenge my clan.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.550
Lord Chen, you want revenge?

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.880
Then that's fitting.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.150
You know me.

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:18.150
I do not act

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.920
without personal gain,

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.350
but when it comes to serious matters,

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.040
I am clear-headed.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.630
The former king

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.720
achieved nothing

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.310
and made no mistakes.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.980
But in less than a month
after he ascended the throne,

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.730
you know best how many reckless things

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.040
Zhao Yue has done.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.480
If not for you and the Queen Mother,

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.950
could Zhao Yue

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.680
sit firmly on this throne?

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.200
Now, for a new consort,

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:51.960
he has killed your daughter

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.960
and your family

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.310
and imprisoned the Queen Mother.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.280
As a man, he is treacherous.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.680
As a king, he is licentious and lawless.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.910
Can such a man

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.680
still continue as the King of North Qi?

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.320
Among the Sixteen Cities,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.590
half of the City Lords

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.910
have reached a consensus with me.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.000
As long as you rise in rebellion,

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.070
they will surely support you in turn.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.760
Lord Chen,

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.800
it is up to you now.

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.230
I'm willing to cooperate

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:36.840
with Mr. Gongsun

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.520
to defeat Zhao Yue

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.920
and avenge

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.550
my entire clan.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:52.020
(Xuan City)

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.060
(Qizhou)

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.900
(Xuan City)

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.660
(Qizhou)

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.020
(The King is licentious; Kill him)

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:10.910
Your Majesty,

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:11.960
inside Qizhou City,

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.360
it is suddenly being widely spread

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.040
that you're not our legitimate ruler,

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.550
that you favor a foreign consort,

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.070
and that you are

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.360
immoral

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.070
and unfit to rule.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.420
(Kill)

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.670
How ridiculous.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.150
The people have known your attempt

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:29.440
to exterminate the Great Sui delegation.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.800
The Great Sui troops are at the border,

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.670
ready to attack at any time.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.190
Your Majesty.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.130
Bad news, Your Majesty.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.880
Your Majesty, bad news.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.240
What's wrong?

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.460
The City Lord of Xuan,

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.100
who should have been executed,

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.620
has suddenly returned to Xuan City

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.320
and organized a force,

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:49.550
apparently intending

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.750
to counterattack Qizhou.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.960
On what grounds?

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:55.590
On what grounds?

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.480
Your Majesty, spare me.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.630
I dare not tell you.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.750
You shall dare now, right?

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.360
They said

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.480
that you're unfit as a ruler

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:11.880
and must be punished by all.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.630
They want to overthrow you

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.070
for the sake of North Qi.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.630
Your Majesty, have mercy.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.590
You dared not tell me

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.710
because you agreed

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.150
with them, right?

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.670
From an abandoned illegitimate child,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.360
I have risen to this day.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.110
Every step has been risky.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.440
To sit on the throne

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:32.920
is destiny's favor.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.270
Even destiny aids me.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.630
You're just nothing!

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.620
(Chengtian Hall, Qi)

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.990
Your Majesty.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.760
Ping,

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:20.800
he will not harm me.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.360
Leave us.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:28.540
(Bright and Virtuous)

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.670
Changming,

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.150
you're the only one I have now.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.670
(If I were to kill you now,)

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.040
(I'd have my revenge,)

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.320
(but who'd pay for the pain)

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.590
(of the people of Great Sui?)

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.520
(I will make you watch)

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.000
(your throne collapse.)

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.880
(I will make North Qi)

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.270
(bow completely to Great Sui.)

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.320
What happened?

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.880
The main gates were destroyed.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.260
The City Lord of Xuan is attacking.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:21.920
Your Majesty,

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.670
chaos has broken out in the Palace.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.470
Give me it.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.350
Who is leading the troops?

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.440
Your Majesty,

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.560
it's the City Lord of Xuan.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.140
They claim you were bewitched

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.910
to kill your wife
and imprison your mother,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.800
so they've led troops

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.100
to rid you of the bad influence.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.240
We're losing

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.440
the Palace.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.550
I've arranged carriages

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.230
with 500 elite soldiers

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.230
to escort you out.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:58.910
Zhao Yue,

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.750
they want to kill me.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.920
If you hand me over,

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.000
your throne will remain secure.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.840
I have sat

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.550
on that throne once.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.230
I can sit on it again.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.800
But you are

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.360
the only one in this world.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.630
It won't be easy

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.320
to rise again.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.670
Are you truly so confident?

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.840
No one in this world

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:35.840
can take you away

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:37.520
from me.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.550
Your Majesty, the Queen Mother...

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.000
I was merciful and spared

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.000
her life last time.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.840
My bond with her is broken.

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.590
Her fate

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.440
is for others to decide.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.320
If Yue returns

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.960
Li Changming

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.320
to Great Sui now,

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:17.750
there may yet be a chance.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.670
But Yue

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.000
can no longer

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.480
listen to me.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.230
Since he's decided to leave,

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.440
let him leave.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.670
I have defeated my brother

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.880
and Su Can.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:43.840
After three kings,

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.190
the Palace is my foundation.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.040
I must survive

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:57.520
to see

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.480
how it ends for him.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.880
Where are we going?

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.760
To Dongliang.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.590
With rebels from 11 cities in the north

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.480
and the Great Sui's army in the south,

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.580
only by passing through Baidi Valley

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.920
to Dongliang

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:42.320
can I create a chance to survive.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:45.920
Last time, when you brought me

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.880
to escape from Huajing,

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.750
did you feel the same way?

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.160
Changming,

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.920
from now on,

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.110
you and I will only have each other

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:02.440
in this world.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.440
I do love your temperament,

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.270
but now,

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.550
you'd better not provoke me.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.070
What is it?

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.300
Bad news, Your Majesty.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.480
