Zhang Xun

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.200
Yu Xingchen

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.080
It's been over ten years.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.640
You're not here just to see me, right?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.360
Do you still remember Su Ruo?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.400
I remember.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.600
She's dead.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.280
Class President said you were invited
to the memorial.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.440
But you didn't go.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.840
Why didn't you go?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.880
Why should I go?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.560
It's been over ten years.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.160
I barely knew her.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.360
If you barely knew her, why send a wreath?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.960
Are you feeling guilty about something?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.440
Yu Xingchen

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.760
What are you really trying to say?

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.280
Su Ruo mentioned in her diary

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.720
someone she really disliked.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.480
This person liked her for fifteen years.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.480
You liked her too.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.960
She said that person got angry after drinking.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.320
You drink too.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.400
Most importantly,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.280
you mentioned recently on social media

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.440
that you just met her.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.120
So why did you just lie about it?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.840
And also,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.480
Tang Song mentioned a letter.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.160
Did you give that to Su Ruo too?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.160
What are you doing?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.600
I want to twist your head off.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560
Don't do anything crazy.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.000
Tang Song is coming soon.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.120
Officer Tang

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.520
It's perfect, we haven't met in years.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.120
He can join us too.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.800
I've missed you guys too.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.360
Zhang Xun

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.720
You...

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840
Are you running away?

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.440
You said all that just now,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.600
just to accuse me of being involved
with Su Ruo's death?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.760
Su Ruo's building has no elevator.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.240
With your condition,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.320
you couldn't catch up to a normal person.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.760
Let alone chase someone to the top floor.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.920
Sorry, Zhang Xun.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.600
I did meet Su Ruo recently.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.600
She was as beautiful as ever.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.440
We had a few drinks together.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.320
I got drunk and tried to hit on her.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.960
I wanted to pursue her.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.000
She refused.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.320
I chased her with my lame leg.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.400
And I ended up pushing her down.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.720
Is that what you wanted to hear?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.920
Sorry.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.680
Zhang Xun

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.560
I shouldn't have doubted you.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.040
No, no, no. How could you misunderstand me?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.840
I really did kill her.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.880
Someone as messed up as me,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.160
so annoying,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.120
and loves to drink,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.400
why would I hide meeting her?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.760
I'm the real killer, aren't I?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.600
No.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.240
You hid it

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.640
because you didn't want everyone

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.760
to see she wasn't doing well.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.600
Why didn't I go to the funeral?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.360
Because I felt guilty.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.920
No.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.360
You didn't go to the funeral

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.880
because you didn't want everyone to see

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.120
how you are now.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.320
Sorry, Zhang Xun.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.600
You used to be reckless, but...

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.440
Sorry, Zhang Xun.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.400
I've been out of my mind lately.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.960
I shouldn't have doubted you.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.160
Send Officer Tang a message.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.200
Don't call the police for a loser like me.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.480
It's not worth it.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.560
Tang Song

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.240
Sorry about that.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.040
Let's call it a night.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.320
We'll get together next time.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.360
Sorry.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.240
Enough.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920
Let them doubt if they want.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.040
It's not a big deal.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.280
Honestly,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.400
Yu Xingchen

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.760
you'd go this far for Su Ruo,
who you haven't seen in over ten years.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.840
Just to find out the truth.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.840
Shows you're willing to risk it all.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.280
If I really was the killer today,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.080
you'd be dead.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.240
I respect you for that.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.160
You're loyal enough.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.040
A few days before it happened,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.400
I wanted to get a massage.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.920
You saw my leg.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.880
It hurts every few days.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.520
I walked around outside the therapy shop.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.160
Found out I couldn't afford it.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.120
Just as I was about to leave,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.760
she got off work.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.000
She massaged my knee and calf.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.960
For two whole hours.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.520
Didn't charge me a cent.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.360
I asked if I could post about it online.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.680
She said sure.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.360
But from her face, I knew

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.360
she didn't want more people

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.680
to know about her situation.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.440
So I just wrote something random.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.080
Said some inappropriate things.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.800
That's true.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.240
Stuff like "curvy and sexy."

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.080
Looks like a pervert wrote it.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.400
Now that you mention it,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.640
I really do seem like a pervert.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.960
That's just how I am.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.560
I can't control what I say.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.680
Didn't expect you and the Class President
to misunderstand.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.240
Speaking of your leg,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.960
it never healed after that time.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.480
How does that saying go?

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.120
It's so sentimental.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.800
Some wounds

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.800
never heal.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.320
The year we were seniors in high school,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.400
Zhang Xun was badly injured.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.480
He never recovered, even by graduation.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.600
After Teacher Jiang told Zhang Xun's parents,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.760
they probably still thought

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.760
Zhang Xun was just being mischievous as usual.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160
So they showed up late.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.000
Help me.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.480
They didn't even take him to the hospital.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.080
Not until three days later

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.720
did Zhang Xun return to school.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.760
Three months passed.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.040
The bandages came off.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.840
But his foot was still

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.560
not healed yet.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.680
Why heal so fast?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.560
It's nice to have someone help you in class.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.760
See that?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.120
Did you see that?

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.400
A pretty girl helps him remove the bandage.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.720
Why rush to get better?

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.440
Su Ruo, why are you picking up bad habits?

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.360
That summer after graduation,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.880
his foot still hadn't healed.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.040
But we didn't take it to heart.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.600
We always thought things would get better.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.840
Back then, about the world,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.080
we felt the same way.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.120
Eggplant.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.440
I still remember the track team tryouts.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.760
You said someone kicked you and you fell.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.320
With such a serious injury,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.120
didn't you want to find out who did it?

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.280
Find them?

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.480
Tell me how to find them.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.960
Tell me how to find them.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.200
Did you find the person in your diary?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.920
It's been so long.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280
How could I find them?

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560
You're a physics guy.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.560
You tell me.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.000
Unless time could go backward.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.840
Back to our high school days.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.280
Is that possible?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.720
Impossible.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.360
Sir, don't lock the door.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520
I want to go to the rooftop.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.840
The leaders gave orders.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.160
There was an incident on this rooftop.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.160
It's closed now.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.120
I'll be honest with you.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.640
The girl who had an accident here recently,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.760
she was my high school classmate.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.000
We were pretty close.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.360
So I just wanted

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.760
to see her a couple more times.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.120
Don't stay too long.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.040
Okay.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.920
Thank you.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.720
I'll stay until nine o'clock.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.720
Deep down inside,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.280
I already believed what Tang Song said.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.200
Maybe I just couldn't accept it.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.160
Ten.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.200
Nine.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.040
Eight.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.000
Seven.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.000
Six.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.000
Five.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.000
Four.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.120
Three.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.200
Two.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.240
One.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.680
What are you doing, Zhang Xun?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.720
It's not time yet.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.200
Come sit back down.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.240
Su Ruo didn't come to school?

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.800
Are you still mad at me?

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.640
Are you that upset I turned you down?

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.280
Who's mad at you?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.960
You're acting strange.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.560
You like Su Ruo yourself,

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.560
but you didn't notice she's been absent for days.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.040
You keep asking me

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.960
Su Ruo hasn't come to school for days.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.480
Did something happen?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.440
How would I know?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.280
Class is over, everyone.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.680
Charge!

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.120
How does that saying go?

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.880
Some wounds never heal.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.920
Zhang Xun, teacher said no running in class.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.800
Unless time could go backward.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.280
Back to our high school days.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560
Is that possible?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.040
Impossible.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.560
Possible.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.360
Where are you going? Didn't I say before?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.440
During senior year,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.520
no leaving campus, even at lunch break.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.200
Teacher Jiang.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.960
Su Ruo hasn't come to school for days.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.240
I really have something urgent.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.840
Su Ruo asked me for leave.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.160
I've noticed

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.760
you've been a bit

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.120
too concerned about Su Ruo lately.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.760
It's senior year.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.840
If you have any funny ideas,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.320
wait until after the college entrance exam.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.960
Yu Xingchen, your mock exam results are out.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.960
You're halfway out the door of a top university.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.560
It's fine if you mess up your own future,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.000
but don't drag Su Ruo down with you.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.000
Teacher Jiang, I heard someone's been bullying her.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.120
She's really in danger.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.000
Let me go out.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.320
Her biggest danger now

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.600
is falling into the pit of puppy love.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.960
Go back.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.320
Teacher Jiang.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.000
This needs teamwork.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Get down and lie flat.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.120
I'll step on you to climb over.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.560
Then you pull me up.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.040
My hand's hurt, I have no strength today.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.560
If you get out, what about me?

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.840
Teamwork always needs someone to sacrifice.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.800
Why should I be the one to sacrifice?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.120
I have something important outside.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.160
Today is the Kobe vs. Wade Showdown.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.240
I'm going to the shop next door to watch the live broadcast.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.960
That's it?

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.320
What do you mean, "that's it"? It's the showdown of the century!

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.480
Hundreds of millions are watching.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.600
Darn it, it's the last few minutes.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.200
The score is neck and neck.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.440
I don't want to miss the end of this live game.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.160
This game?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.160
December fifth.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:08.760
I know.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.960
The Lakers won in the end.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.880
Kobe made the game-winning shot.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.280
You're making it up, that's nonsense.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.560
Do you dare to bet with me?

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.240
If I'm right,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.920
you squat and I'll step on you to get out.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.040
If I'm wrong,

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.440
I'll be your stepping stone.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.840
Wait until we know the result.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.080
Isn't the game already over?

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.680
Then why would I go out?

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.840
Let's make a big bet.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.560
I bet not only the Lakers win,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.560
Kobe makes the game-winner,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.720
I even bet it's in the last five seconds.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.560
Kobe banks it in over Wade for the win.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.920
Final score is set at 108 to 107.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.040
If I get even one word wrong,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.200
I'll buy you meals for a month.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.040
You buy me meals for a month.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.400
But if I'm right,

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.160
you help me get out.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.360
Deal.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.600
I choose what we eat.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.720
Deal.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.120
Kobe wins it at the buzzer.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.520
Kobe catches the ball at a forty-five degree angle.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.920
Shoots over Wade's head.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.680
Ball goes up, buzzer sounds, banks it in for the win.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.560
Final score is 108 to 107.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.360
How do you know that?

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.320
I've seen it.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.560
NBA games aren't live.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.800
Is it a replay then?

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.360
Alright, come over here.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.200
Squat down.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.440
Thanks.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.920
Yu Xingchen, where did you watch the replay?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.000
It's great to be alive.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.560
Did you get it right, Su Ruo?

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.720
Wow, game-winner!

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.360
Amazing, that's incredible.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.480
This game is so exciting.
