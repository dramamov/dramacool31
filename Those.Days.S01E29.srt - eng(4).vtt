=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.130
=Episode 29=

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.370
Who in your family

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.080
is sick?

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.199
My son.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.160
He has a serious illness.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.399
He's my only child.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.800
I have to save him no matter what.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.520
It's expensive in here.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.440
Ten thousand a day.

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:03.960
But what can I do?

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.759
Money can't compare to a life.

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:11.559
I sold my house.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.480
I've been here

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.839
for 53 days.

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:27.640
Who's yours?

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.999
My mom.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.399
She was brought in yesterday.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.320
Your mom?

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.439
There, there.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:40.999
She'll be alright.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.559
Don't worry.

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:44.679
Oh, no.

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.439
You can't do it like this.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.320
Follow what they do.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.760
Get a camp bed.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.119
You can rest day and night.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.879
Miss,

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.159
I suggest you

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.480
buy an eye mask.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.200
The lights here are too bright at night.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.599
Just bring a small blanket,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.750
or you won't know
where to put it during the day.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.920
Miss,

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.760
bring a bigger thermos.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.119
The water dispenser is far.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.200
Really inconvenient.

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.520
There are all our experiences.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.070
Give it to me, Mingzhu.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.040
This is my sister-in-law.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.200
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.599
You're pregnant.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.999
That's not easy.

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.399
You should sit.

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.760
Sit.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.439
Thank you.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.480
Don't mention it.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.360
Thank you, mister.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.279
You're welcome.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.119
Being pregnant is tough.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.240
Everyone is tough.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.360
Mingzhu,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.760
how much money do we have left?

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.999
Only 24,200 altogether.

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:44.279
I brought all of Dad's condolence money.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:46.559
Is that all we have?

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.080
These are from friends.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.800
At least those business partners

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.240
aren't here to collect debts.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.920
They're realistic.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.040
Everyone is.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.599
You and I too.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.440
Shen.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.799
Come here.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.839
What's wrong?

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.239
Look how much we should transfer.

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:28.320
Here.

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.640
Why me?

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.440
You decide.

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.080
Aren't you the head of the family?

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:36.279
Since when am I the head of the family?

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.080
That's it?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.950
That's all the money?

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.359
What do you mean?

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:45.560
You think I...

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.680
I mean, even if that's all the money,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.719
they're everything my wife

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:50.650
worked so hard to save.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.680
I worked so hard for this,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.120
yet I'm giving it
to Mingzhu's mother-in-law,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.440
who looks down on us.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.039
Just thinking about it makes me angry.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.919
Look at you.

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.359
You send them money

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.640
and complain at the same time.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:09.200
Isn't that silly?

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.680
Yes, I am.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.060
How much should we transfer then?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.560
You decide.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.640
It's to save a life.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.279
Just transfer

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.239
everything we have.

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:23.039
All of it?

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.760
If not all, then what?

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.279
You're really silly.

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:31.880
My silly wife.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880
Xiu'e

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.560
is a silly dear.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.740
(Shen Mingzhu, Yue Xiu'e has transferred
120,450 yuan to your account.)

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.159
Hello, Mom?

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.120
Why did you send me so much money?

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:59.440
It's not much.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.719
ICU is a money pit.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.399
Let it cover a few days.

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.080
Even though
I don't like your mother-in-law,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.599
we can't just sit on our hands.

00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:10.120
Why didn't your father-in-law

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.479
buy insurance?

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.799
But that's your retirement money.

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.680
Nonsense. What retirement?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.680
I'm still young.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.960
We're far from retiring.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.919
I'm young too.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.200
We're still strong enough to work.

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:23.120
We can still work.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.919
Don't worry.

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:28.239
Do you still have money for yourselves?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.919
Yes.

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:29.880
Yes.

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.320
Your mom has three bank cards.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.279
Right. We're fine.

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.080
We have money.

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:37.359
Mingzhu,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880
listen.

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.530
Your dad and I
can't leave the restaurant right now,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.239
so we won't come help you
at the hospital.

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:46.320
Just be careful.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.359
Don't strain yourself.

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:48.320
Careful of what?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.599
Stay calm.

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:50.880
Don't rush it.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.640
You're carrying a baby now.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.799
Alright?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.799
You know what I mean, right?

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:56.599
Okay.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.680
Number 29, please proceed to window 5
for payment.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.839
Mom, it's my turn.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:02.799
I'm hanging up.

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:03.760
Go on.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.039
Meiqi.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.279
Mingzhu.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.680
How much did you pay today?

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.399
Look.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.640
What's it?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.399
Thanks to my mom reminding me,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.320
I suddenly remembered

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.359
I bought my dad a life insurance policy.

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:25.120
Why did you buy life insurance for Dad?

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.279
He told me to buy an education fund
for the baby.

00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:28.479
I asked the agent,

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.279
and they said
based on our family situation,

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:31.760
I should insure Dad.

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:34.760
Thank you, Mingzhu.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.560
But

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:39.719
I put "legal heir" as the beneficiary.

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:41.000
By right,

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:43.320
that kid gets a share too.

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:47.520
We're not even sure
if that's my dad's child.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.960
Don't take this the wrong way,

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.320
but that kid

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.039
looks exactly like your dad.

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:04.760
What do we do?

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.440
My mom almost died because of them,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.260
and now I have to
split the money with them?

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.000
Look,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.680
take the insurance policy

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.799
to the company

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.039
and see if you can claim it.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.640
Saving Mom is more important.

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:24.479
I'll send you the policy.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.520
Alright.

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:32.800
Excuse me. I'd like to ask about

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.040
how to file a claim
on the life insurance

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.519
my dad bought before his death.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.839
Do you have a death certificate?

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:38.759
Yes.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.280
The household register's here too.

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:55.400
Are you the only child?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.759
I have an older brother.

00:08:57.719 --> 00:08:58.599
He passed away.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.639
Your mom isn't here?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.200
She had a brain hemorrhage.
She's in the ICU.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.519
We need this money for her treatment.

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.280
Okay.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:12.999
Here's the thing.

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:14.839
According to the policy,

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:16.719
you need to provide notarization.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.960
Notarization?

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.639
Yes, you have to prove

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:21.080
you're the sole legal heir.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.040
Because

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.160
we've had cases before

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.080
where children claimed the payout,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.839
and later the parent's extramarital kid

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.290
showed up and caused trouble.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.200
Okay, I see.

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:36.999
Notarization?

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:38.280
Yes.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:41.119
That child has a birth certificate,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.190
so he'll have
household registration too.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.960
Once I notarize it,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.130
the mom will definitely show up
to fight for the inheritance.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.920
But without the notarization,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.519

What are you saying, Mom?

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.359
Your mom keeps muttering
about "jade bracelet"

00:15:09.359 --> 00:15:10.280
and "one".

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.200

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.280

to be the real one?

00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:01.759

something this big?

Take it.

00:16:22.119 --> 00:16:23.320
No, I can't take your money.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.839
Take it. Saving life comes first.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.999

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.200

Zhixia,

00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:56.759
there's something I want to ask.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:57.719
What's it?

00:16:57.719 --> 00:16:58.960
About the bracelet.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.850
After you fixed it
and gave it back to me,

00:17:01.239 --> 00:17:03.280
I can't see any traces of repair.

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.559
What happened?

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:11.079
Is it the same bracelet that broke?

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:13.680
Tell me.

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:17.239
No.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.090
My mom was worried you'd be in
a tough spot with your in-laws,

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.440
so she went to Banqiao Jade Market

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.719
and bought you an identical one.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:27.079
How much is that?

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.079
That's too expensive.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.279
It's not about money.

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:31.640
Ms. Yu did it from the heart.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.350
That's not something money can buy.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:34.239
But...

00:17:34.239 --> 00:17:34.960
Look.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.320
The last time she was hospitalized,
you went to visit her.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.960
She saw you wearing the bracelet,

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.640
and she brightened up right away.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.840
No, I can't.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.039
What are you doing?

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:45.079
Zhixia, listen.

00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:46.319
I appreciate what your mom did.

00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:47.239
Thank her for me.

00:17:47.239 --> 00:17:48.840
But I really can't take this bracelet.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.479
I'll fix the bracelet myself.

00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:51.079
It'll still work.

00:17:51.079 --> 00:17:52.440
- What?
- Your bracelet is fake.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.880
What's there to fix?

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.400
Let me tell you the truth.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.559
Your bracelet is fake.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.440
That's why my mom

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.920
bought you an identical one.

00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:06.840
She didn't want credit for it.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.400
She just wanted you

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:10.880
to wear it on your wrist.

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:13.039
If now you want me

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.440
to give it back to her,

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.559
do you know how anxious she'd be?

00:18:16.999 --> 00:18:18.680
She's already worried sick.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:20.999
Just take it.

(High-price Motorbike Buyers)

00:18:36.319 --> 00:18:38.079
Where did you get these awful candies?

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.540
I went to drop off a gift this morning.
I grabbed them on the way.

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:41.910
Couldn't you take something nicer?

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.079
Be grateful.

00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:50.079
You're back again.

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:55.840
Man.

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:00.479
Three red packets are too much.

No, no, Xu.

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:03.239
No.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.239
That's separate
from selling the motorbike.

00:19:04.239 --> 00:19:05.519
You don't have to give me that.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:06.799
Have some wedding candy.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.559
Candy? I can't.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.440
I don't smoke.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.559

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.079
Come.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.680
Want some wedding candy?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.479
No.

00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:17.960
I'm too old for sweets.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.680
I honestly didn't shortchange you.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.840
This is the most I can offer.

Alright.

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:23.319
If you had decided earlier last time,

00:19:23.319 --> 00:19:24.479
you would've gotten the money sooner.

00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:25.200
- Fine.
- Right?

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:27.759
Please sign here, the owner.

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:36.239
Xu,

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:37.680
your car has a fine.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.160
No.

00:19:39.319 --> 00:19:40.519
It's written right there.

00:19:41.319 --> 00:19:43.160
It's yours. Illegal operation.

00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:44.239
Wait, miss.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.039
I have relatives.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.760
I know someone
in the traffic department.

00:19:47.999 --> 00:19:49.160
He settled it.

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:50.279
Impossible.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.759
Xu,

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:52.999
all you need to do

00:19:52.999 --> 00:19:54.600
is pay the fine.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.479
That's the only way to settle it.

00:19:55.479 --> 00:19:57.400
Pulling strings doesn't work anymore
these days.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.160
You settled it?

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:04.519
It's no big deal.

00:20:15.999 --> 00:20:17.440
How much is the fine, Miss?

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.519
Three thousand.

00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:33.319
You didn't go to piano class today?

00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:35.200
Mom switched it to online.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.079
It's on Friday.

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:38.319
Why?

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.190
Why did you switch it to online?

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.559
It's cheaper.

00:20:53.239 --> 00:20:54.960
But we already paid.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.319
I paid half.

00:20:59.319 --> 00:21:00.079
We didn't.

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:04.039
Where did the money go?

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:07.680
I lent it to my sister.

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:29.160
Hao,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.479
drink some milk.

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:41.079
Hao,

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.920
have some fruit.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.680
Hao,

00:21:53.759 --> 00:21:56.120
don't be mad.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.479
I really thought about it carefully.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.680
Online classes are fine too.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.079
The teachers are responsible.

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:13.440
Who said you should
keep your standards high?

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.440
Who said if you're going to learn,
you should learn from the best?

00:22:19.479 --> 00:22:20.120
Zhixia,

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.600
I think

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.039
we should look after
our own family first

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:26.200
before helping your big family.

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:30.079
Piano lessons and someone's life,

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.120
which one matters more?

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.640
You can't compare them.

00:22:34.239 --> 00:22:36.239
That's your sister's mother-in-law.

00:22:36.239 --> 00:22:36.920
She's not directly related.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.719
Like you said, that's my sister.

00:22:38.719 --> 00:22:39.920
She's married into another family.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.880
So what?

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.680
She's still my sister.

00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:45.079
We're blood related, you know?

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:48.079
So by that logic,

00:22:48.479 --> 00:22:49.400
"A married-off daughter

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.840
is spilled water"?

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.759
If Jiao gets married someday,

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.319
will she not be our daughter anymore?

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.360
Don't be mad.

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:07.160
Hao.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.479
How are things going

00:23:12.479 --> 00:23:15.279
with the promotion assessment?

00:23:16.319 --> 00:23:16.960
I know

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.759
it's a terrible time

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:19.799
to bring it up.

00:23:20.479 --> 00:23:23.559
But I've been so stressed lately.

00:23:23.719 --> 00:23:24.799
I want something

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.600
to cheer me up.

00:23:28.279 --> 00:23:31.400
If my promotion could cheer you up,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.559
chances are it won't.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.559
Why?

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:35.940
Because I think the one getting it

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.239
is probably Wu.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.680
He's got stronger backing,

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.559
more connections,

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:40.960
and he's more sociable.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.600
Zhang Hao.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.239
You can't

00:23:44.239 --> 00:23:45.680
sell yourself short.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.719
Why are you being such a coward?

00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:48.319
Dad,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.719
are we still getting donuts?

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.479
I forgot.

00:23:53.719 --> 00:23:56.319
Hurry and go. It's almost eight.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.840
We'll go to the supermarket

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.920
to see if eggs are on sale.

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:11.759
I must say,

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.759
I'm starting

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.039
to see Yu Jingxiang differently.

00:24:18.479 --> 00:24:19.920
She spent so much

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.759
to buy Mingzhu a real jade bracelet,

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.319
took the fake one herself,

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:25.960
and never even mentioned it.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.239
If Mingzhu's mother-in-law
hadn't fallen ill,

00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:31.759
no one would've known.

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:34.360
I actually think she and her husband

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.319
are genuinely good to Mingzhu.

00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:38.400
No.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.640
Something's off.

00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:42.400
I need to think about it.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.759
That woman is suspicious

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.239
and calculating.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.799
She might be a spy.

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:51.840
Mom,

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.840
it's peacetime.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.799
No.

00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:58.279
Go upstairs

00:24:58.279 --> 00:24:59.719
and bring that bracelet down.

00:24:59.719 --> 00:25:01.719
We'll sell it and return
the money to her.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.440
I don't want any messy ties.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.920
We'll walk our path, she walks hers.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.559
We don't owe her anything.

00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:06.160
No way.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:08.960
Dad and I worked so hard
selling pork chops

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.680
to buy that bracelet

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.239
for you.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.479
I don't care about
other people's heirlooms,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.759
but ours is not for sale.

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:18.559
Minghui gave it to you

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.680
with all his heart.

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:21.999
And you're going to sell it.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.060
Right?

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.960
Besides, unless you wait
eight or ten years,

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.400
you won't get a good price

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.799
for selling the bracelet.

00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:29.120
We really

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.680
have no money now.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.519
If I don't sell it,

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:34.719
we'll owe that Yu woman a favor.

00:25:34.719 --> 00:25:36.360
How will we face her later?

00:25:39.719 --> 00:25:40.279
I'm done.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.360
She's just saying.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.440
She won't sell it.

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:50.400
Minghui is upset.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.559
What are we going to do?

00:25:51.559 --> 00:25:52.279
We have no money.

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:53.600
Not even a dime.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.039
If we don't give her back the money,

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:55.999
- she'll...
- Why bring this up

00:25:55.999 --> 00:25:57.479
while we're eating?

00:25:59.239 --> 00:25:59.799
What?

00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:00.759
You think you can sell it right away?

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:01.750
Who would you sell it to?

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:03.719
You always act on impulse.

00:26:03.719 --> 00:26:04.920
What's wrong with you?

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.880
Minghui, I peeled an apple for you.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.759
It's so good. Crisp and sweet.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.239
Come on. Have a bite.

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:33.079
I don't want it.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.700
Just take one.

00:26:38.519 --> 00:26:40.400
It's crisp and sweet. Really.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.400
Here. Just one. Be good.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:42.999
Here you go.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.079
I'm not eating it.

00:26:47.999 --> 00:26:49.039
I'm sorry.

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:52.039
I promise

00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:54.120
I'll never sell the bracelet, okay?

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.680
I'll save it for your future wife, okay?

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.600
Swear it.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.039
I swear.

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:05.519
If I, Yue Xiu'e, sell the bracelet

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:06.759
in this lifetime,

00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:07.440
then I will...

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.479
Alright. Enough, Mom.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.039
I know you're a sweet boy.

00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:12.319
Number one.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.600
Here. It's nice.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.400
Just one piece.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.360
Try it.

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:17.999
Good, right?

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:18.920
It's sweet.

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.050
I'm not giving it to you.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.079
You little brat.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.039
Shen.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.039
Why did you come here at this hour?

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.319
Shen, I just found out

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.239
you paid that fine

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.600
for me.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.039
You mean that sidecar?

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:43.519
Well, that?

00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:44.600
That's nothing. Forget it.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.279
Wait.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.039
Thirty thousand.

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:49.799
Take it.

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:51.120
I sold my motorbike.

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:52.120
What?

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.440
You treasure the bike
as if it were your life.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.999
Why did you sell it?

00:27:56.999 --> 00:27:57.960
Don't think too much.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.479
This money isn't for you.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.960
It's for the girl.

00:28:02.479 --> 00:28:05.039
We all know what happened in her family.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.279
My wife can't even sleep.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:08.559
Tell her this.

00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:10.840
Life has always

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.960
thrown problems at you.

00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:15.559
She doesn't need to carry it alone.

00:28:15.559 --> 00:28:18.079
She has two sets of parents now.

00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:19.400
Yes, if you want to show concern,

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.840
show it yourself.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.519
Shen,

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.759
you know

00:28:23.999 --> 00:28:25.840
she's closer to you.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.079
Please.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.160
I'm off.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:46.840
Jiao.

00:28:48.479 --> 00:28:51.759
Don't let Grandma know your piano lesson
has switched to online.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.559
Why not?

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:58.640
Because Grandma is one of the investors
in your piano lessons.

00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:01.479
Dad,

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.600
does this count as lying?

00:29:05.999 --> 00:29:07.840
Am I lying

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.600
because you didn't get promoted?

00:29:11.319 --> 00:29:12.960
If you never become a director,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.279
does that mean I'll have to keep lying?

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:18.519
Well...

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.719
We're here.

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:35.759
Jiao.

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:38.840
Why didn't you buy your favorite donut?

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.120
They're cheap. Buy one, get one free.

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:45.160
Jiao, put them back.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.960
We're not buying discounted stuff today.

00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:49.319
We're buying your favorite.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.479
Dad, you're the best.

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:14.360
Dear.

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:18.479
Jianqi.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.440
I missed you so much, Jianqi.

00:30:26.053 --> 00:30:26.960
Me too.

00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:34.799
Jianqi,

00:30:35.759 --> 00:30:36.920
take me with you.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.479
I can't hold on anymore.

00:30:44.239 --> 00:30:44.880
Mingzhu,

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.719
I can't be selfish.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.880
In your life,

00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:55.039
you're playing many other roles.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.160
You're a daughter

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.440
and a mother.

00:31:03.719 --> 00:31:04.680
Besides,

00:31:05.999 --> 00:31:07.640
you have many friends who love you.

00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:10.160
Right?

00:31:16.239 --> 00:31:16.999
Promise me.

00:31:18.999 --> 00:31:20.239
Live well.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.519
Love yourself.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.600
You can do this.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.920
My little princess.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.540
(Department of Critical Care Medicine)

00:32:44.039 --> 00:32:44.680
Dad.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.759
Go back to sleep.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:47.999
Slowly.

00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:49.759
When did you get here?

00:32:50.319 --> 00:32:51.120
Just now.

00:32:54.759 --> 00:32:56.799
You've been sleeping here like this?

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.319
This is all we have here.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.719
Meiqi and I take care of each other.
It's fine.

00:33:03.239 --> 00:33:05.440
If I'd known, I would've
come over to switch shifts.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.840
No need for that.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.319
We're young. We can handle it.

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:11.200
Silly girl.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.559
Take this.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.950
I can't accept it anymore.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.319
It's not from me.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.200
It's from Xu Dacheng.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.260
He said it was for emergencies.

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:28.640
I definitely can't take it.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.759
Zhixia just sent 50,000 a few days ago.

00:33:31.719 --> 00:33:32.799
Let's keep things straight.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.410
He gave it to you, so take it.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.600
He literally gave his life to you.

00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:40.880
He sold his motorcycle.

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:48.239
Aren't you afraid they'll win me over?

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.640
Why would I be?

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.799
No one can take my daughter away
from me.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.920
Sit down.

00:33:57.999 --> 00:33:59.400
Alright. You sit too.

00:34:03.719 --> 00:34:05.200
Miss.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.640
You're awake.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:07.880
Look at this.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.240
Look what I bought.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.760
Instant noodles, Laba congee,
and dim sum.

00:34:12.559 --> 00:34:14.199
The supermarket is having a sale.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.240
Everything is so cheap.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.599
Which supermarket?

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:20.599
The one on the right when you walk out.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.079
I know that one.

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.119
You should go too.

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:23.880
I'll go buy some.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.119
No, don't go. I'll go.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.119
You've been eating these
for the past few days?

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.240
Let me tell you.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.670
When you're at death's door,

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.999
having this is good enough.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.039
My daughter has never had
to eat like this.

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:36.639
Tell me what you want to eat.

00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:39.079
I'll ask Minghui to bring it.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.599
My dad runs a restaurant.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.280
Yes, I...

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.880
I really need to say this.

00:34:46.999 --> 00:34:49.760
You have to treat your daughter better.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.519
She's carrying a baby now

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.360
and waiting for her mother-in-law

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.639
without resting.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.519
She never once complained

00:34:56.519 --> 00:34:57.800
or said she was tired.

00:34:58.039 --> 00:34:59.760
And her smile.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.559
She smiles at everyone.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.920
I felt like

00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:06.639
the death's door closed again.

00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:08.559
Thank you so much.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.639
You haven't eaten, right?

00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:10.559
It's fine.

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:11.559
I'll go buy.

00:35:11.559 --> 00:35:13.039
I bought soy milk.

00:35:13.039 --> 00:35:13.760
No, I'll buy.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.760
No need.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.320
Take it.

00:35:16.479 --> 00:35:17.079
Miss.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.119
Take it.

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:18.639
Soy milk.

00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:20.250
- You bought soy milk again.
- Drink it while it's warm.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.240
Yeah. It's nice to drink.

00:35:22.999 --> 00:35:24.400
I added lots of sugar.

00:35:25.559 --> 00:35:27.920
Let's add a little sweetness to life.

00:35:28.479 --> 00:35:29.639
Yes, sweetness.

00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:31.840
Let's toast.

00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:32.639
Cheers.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.599
Cheers.

00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:34.760
Cheers.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.039
Keep it down.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.920
It tastes good.

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.230
Excuse me. I'm here to pay.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:44.760
Alright.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.440
I have cash.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.830
If it's not enough, I'll use my card.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.400
Okay.

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:53.119
This bag was hard to get at that time.

00:35:54.639 --> 00:35:55.760
It's nice.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.280
Why are you selling it?

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.320
I have too many bags.
I can't use them all.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:20.800
The buttons are still perfect.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.999
Not a bit rusty.

00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:23.280
Also,

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.280
this design was also
very popular back then.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.559
So I bought it.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.840
He Lihua's family.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:08.999
Doctor.

00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:09.880
Don't worry.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.240
Your mom can be transferred
to a regular ward today.

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:16.039
Get ready.

00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:17.920
Thank you, doctor.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.240
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

00:37:29.039 --> 00:37:31.720
Even though she's been
transferred to a regular ward,

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.599
she still needs time

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.360
to fully recover.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.920
It'll be tough for you for a while.

00:37:38.639 --> 00:37:40.240
If anything comes up, call me.

00:37:40.479 --> 00:37:41.039
Thank you.

00:37:41.039 --> 00:37:41.880
Sign the paper.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.559
Thank you.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.720
(My mother-in-law has finally
moved to a regular ward.)

00:38:06.679 --> 00:38:08.199
(The toughest days)

00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:10.119
(are behind us at last.)

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.599
(There are still many problems ahead)

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.199
(and many hurdles to cross.)

00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:17.999
(But Meiqi and I believe)

00:38:18.199 --> 00:38:21.039
(the hardest part is over.)

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:26.400
Go! Come on!

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.079
You guys continue.

00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:35.400
Wait.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.999
Mr. Hua.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.119
Where are you going?

00:38:38.639 --> 00:38:39.479
Mr. Hua.

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:42.599
What's the matter?

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.410
I have something to discuss with you.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.280
Can the canteen
prepay next year's pork chop order?

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:50.999
Next year?

00:38:51.479 --> 00:38:52.039
Yes.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.360
If you pay this year,

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:54.960
you'll get a 12% discount next year.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.119
Good deal.

00:38:57.559 --> 00:38:59.079
We don't know about this year yet.

00:38:59.479 --> 00:39:01.079
Who can guarantee next year?

00:39:01.479 --> 00:39:02.639
What if I get reassigned?

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.880
What if you get into college?

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.639
You said "what if".

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:07.960
Think of it this way.

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:10.119
We lock in the discount with time,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.039
and use trust to earn trust.

00:39:13.479 --> 00:39:15.079
You're too eloquent.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.559
You should try something harder.

00:39:16.559 --> 00:39:17.800
Go study broadcasting.

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:19.840
Mr. Hua.

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:21.160
I need to be somewhere else.

00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:22.999
Money-grabber Shen,

00:39:23.999 --> 00:39:25.760
your plan failed.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.210

00:39:57.079 --> 00:39:58.559
Dad, Mom,

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.079
I'm doing live streaming.

00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:02.440
Don't mess around.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.079
Go upstairs and finish your homework.

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:04.960
I finished.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.479
You finished

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.159
senior-year homework?

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.639
I couldn't finish it
back in my third senior year,

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:11.920
but now I'm in my fifth.

00:40:11.999 --> 00:40:12.999
How could I not finish?

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:14.960
Be good.

00:40:15.639 --> 00:40:16.880
Show your best later.

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:18.599
It's a global live stream.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.199
Everyone can see you.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.360
Alright.

00:40:33.999 --> 00:40:35.639
Hello, everyone.

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:38.559
I'm your Money-grabber Shen.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.519
That's right.

00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:41.479
It's my first day streaming.

00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:42.400
My debut.

00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:43.240
Guys,

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.479
if you're here, don't leave.

00:40:44.479 --> 00:40:47.119
We're giving things away.
Nothing for sale.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.840
First, let me introduce myself.

00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:53.519
I'm the young boss of Shen Restaurant,

00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:54.639
Money-grabber Shen.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:55.599
The Shen Restaurant...

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:56.240
Dacheng,

00:40:56.559 --> 00:40:58.240
look at this.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.999
Isn't this Zhilu's brother?

00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:01.119
Everyone knows us.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.280
Give it another seventy years,
our restaurant will...

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:03.840
Zhidong.

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:04.880
Zhidong.

00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:07.199
Look.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.320
Look around.
We have many customers here.

00:41:09.639 --> 00:41:10.400
See?

00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:12.280
How's the food?

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:12.639
Delicious.

00:41:12.639 --> 00:41:14.840
I must say,

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.360
this boy doesn't talk
this smoothly at school.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.199
He's good at promoting.

00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:20.360
Come on.

00:41:20.479 --> 00:41:22.639
He's got some talent for live streaming.

00:41:24.519 --> 00:41:25.320
Look at this.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.280
Is this Zhilu's brother?

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.119
That's Minghui.

00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:30.159
Minghui? The one you fought with?

00:41:30.159 --> 00:41:31.079
I beat him up.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.039
Good.

00:41:34.599 --> 00:41:35.400
Excellent.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.599
And this.

00:41:37.999 --> 00:41:39.199
It's Mr. Shen.

00:41:41.519 --> 00:41:42.400
Look.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.199
The boss of Shen Restaurant.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.360
Look at him cook. Smooth, fast,

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.599
and dashing.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:51.960
What do you think?

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.320
My dad looks cool, right?

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.079
If you think he's cool,
type "1" in the chat.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.079
If the screen fills with "1",

00:41:59.159 --> 00:42:01.999
I'll give out vouchers.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.639
88 vouchers!

00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:06.039
Type 1.

00:42:06.039 --> 00:42:06.639
Only eight people.

00:42:06.639 --> 00:42:07.119
Come on.

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:07.800
It's fine.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.320
Type 1.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.920
Even if there are only eight, it's fine.

00:42:10.159 --> 00:42:11.870
If there are more people,
we give out more.

00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:14.639
If there are fewer, we give even more.

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:15.960
Right, Dad?

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.880
Hey, I didn't prepare
that many ingredients.

00:42:19.999 --> 00:42:20.960
Give out less.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.079
It's a global live stream.
Everyone is watching.

00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:23.999
Watch your words.

00:42:24.639 --> 00:42:26.240
My dad's panicking.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.120
We're giving out more.

00:42:27.199 --> 00:42:28.720
My dad's panicking.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.039
Guys,

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.440
as you can see,

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.119
the Shen Restaurant

00:42:33.479 --> 00:42:34.519
is small,

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.320
and we don't have
a huge supply capacity.

00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:37.800
But that's okay.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.479
Because we're launching

00:42:39.479 --> 00:42:40.880
a brand-new product line,

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.920
