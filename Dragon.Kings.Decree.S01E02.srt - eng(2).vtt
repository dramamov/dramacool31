00:02:04.453 --> 00:02:06.014
We're just going...

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:08.654
to stand here and wait?

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:27.854
I can't take it anymore.

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.053
Hold on a little longer.

00:02:32.134 --> 00:02:33.414
Sir,

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:35.012
my wound hasn't healed.

00:02:35.013 --> 00:02:36.694
Cut me some slack.

00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:40.493
You can wait here by yourself.

00:02:41.214 --> 00:02:43.053
Stop it already.

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:45.933
You're so heartless.

00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:05.053
(She's just a mortal.)

00:03:05.374 --> 00:03:08.213
(Though gravely wounded,
she still tried to save me.)

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:10.653
(If I'm definitely going to die,)

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.534
(I might as well help her.)

00:03:57.414 --> 00:03:59.854
Move!

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:05.373
What are you doing?

00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:06.732
Why are you holding me?

00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:08.093
Let's make this clear.

00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:09.373
You had a fever last night.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.292
I took care of you

00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:10.973
and got tired...

00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:13.052
A young master like you
taking care of me?

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:15.093
You must've been
trying to take advantage of me

00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:15.892
and get close to me

00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:16.933
while I was hurt.

00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:17.813
Ridiculous.

00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:19.732
Anyone seeing us together

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:21.253
would think you're the one trying

00:04:21.254 --> 00:04:22.573
to take advantage of me.

00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:23.294
You...

00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:25.292
You're a man.

00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:26.052
A male.

00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:27.534
Males are men.

00:04:27.613 --> 00:04:29.692
A man out in the world needs to respect

00:04:29.693 --> 00:04:30.933
and value himself.

00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:42.534
Why do I suddenly feel so light?

00:04:44.613 --> 00:04:46.534
All thanks to my care, of course.

00:04:55.974 --> 00:04:58.133
The Yang poison in you
has eased up a lot too.

00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:00.333
Did you secretly

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:01.654
take the medicine last night?

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.453
Last night?

00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:06.692
I just held you as we slept.

00:05:06.693 --> 00:05:07.933
Stop it.

00:05:10.613 --> 00:05:12.654
Why is this sigil still on my hand?

00:05:12.774 --> 00:05:14.492
When will it come off?

00:05:14.493 --> 00:05:15.812
I have to admit

00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:17.373
that you did save my life.

00:05:17.454 --> 00:05:19.213
Until I get the sigil back,

00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:20.854
you can be my servant.

00:05:23.293 --> 00:05:24.334
What?

00:05:24.534 --> 00:05:26.414
Me? Your servant?

00:05:26.894 --> 00:05:28.252
You're at my place now.

00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:29.732
I saved your life.

00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:30.692
It makes more sense

00:05:30.693 --> 00:05:32.094
for you to be my servant.

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:33.133
Besides,

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:35.654
your treasure is still on my hand.

00:05:36.813 --> 00:05:38.252
From what I see,

00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:39.414
this sigil

00:05:39.654 --> 00:05:41.133
has a mind of its own.

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:43.372
It ended up on my hand

00:05:43.373 --> 00:05:45.053
under some special circumstances.

00:05:45.534 --> 00:05:48.013
If you want to get it back,

00:05:48.373 --> 00:05:49.813
you need to do me a favor.

00:05:50.373 --> 00:05:52.174
Take me to Wujing City.

00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:54.172
That place is huge.

00:05:54.173 --> 00:05:55.492
I'm sure we can find a way

00:05:55.493 --> 00:05:56.773
to get this sigil off.

00:05:56.774 --> 00:05:58.453
Just go wherever you want.

00:05:58.454 --> 00:06:00.053
Why should I help you?

00:06:00.854 --> 00:06:02.333
Ladies from the Feng family

00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:03.453
can't leave without permission

00:06:03.454 --> 00:06:05.214
before marriage.

00:06:06.813 --> 00:06:08.214
So...

00:06:09.253 --> 00:06:10.573
Help me with a little act.

00:06:10.574 --> 00:06:12.053
Pretend to be my husband.

00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:14.292
That way, I can leave this place.

00:06:14.293 --> 00:06:15.492
No way.

00:06:15.493 --> 00:06:17.372
I knew you were cold-hearted,

00:06:17.373 --> 00:06:18.252
only taking,

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.373
never giving.

00:06:19.534 --> 00:06:20.612
Fine, don't help.

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:21.612
I'll go to my uncle.

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:23.053
He'll surely have a way.

00:06:25.493 --> 00:06:26.573
You.

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:28.692
Stay right here.

00:06:28.693 --> 00:06:29.894
Don't go out.

00:06:55.574 --> 00:06:57.453
Dragon God, hear my prayers.

00:06:57.774 --> 00:06:59.252
I am Feng Zhilou.

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.372
Dragon God, please help me

00:07:01.373 --> 00:07:03.172
leave Feng Manor soon

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:04.854
and make a name for myself.

00:07:05.534 --> 00:07:08.172
Without a spiritual root,

00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:09.612
I can't cultivate martial arts

00:07:09.613 --> 00:07:11.053
or fight upfront,

00:07:11.293 --> 00:07:12.013
but

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:13.573
I can heal the wounded

00:07:13.574 --> 00:07:15.654
behind the lines.

00:07:16.094 --> 00:07:17.612
Dragon God, please

00:07:17.613 --> 00:07:18.933
bless that person too.

00:07:20.053 --> 00:07:21.692
He might be a monster.

00:07:21.693 --> 00:07:23.174
Whatever.

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:25.812
Hope he gets out of danger

00:07:25.813 --> 00:07:27.174
and recovers soon.

00:07:31.014 --> 00:07:33.133
(She was praying sincerely)

00:07:33.534 --> 00:07:35.654
(and making a wish to the Dragons.)

00:07:36.214 --> 00:07:39.493
(In other words, she was praying to me.)

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:42.973
How can this rundown place
be fit for Young Master?

00:07:42.974 --> 00:07:45.000
(Member of the Sanctuary, Fei Yuan, Bai Lu)
He has a grand Dragon Palace

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.973
but chooses to live
in this cramped place? Why?

00:07:46.974 --> 00:07:48.813
Does he want to hide in the mountains

00:07:49.014 --> 00:07:50.573
instead of returning to Dragon Palace?

00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:53.214
Young Master has his plans.

00:07:56.133 --> 00:07:57.253
Young Master?

00:07:57.693 --> 00:08:00.214
Young Master,
I've been looking all over for you.

00:08:01.813 --> 00:08:03.734
Great, just great.

00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:06.774
I heard you've
developed a spiritual root.

00:08:06.813 --> 00:08:08.052
But losers

00:08:08.053 --> 00:08:10.174
should just remain as losers.

00:08:11.214 --> 00:08:12.853
I was going
to use this aphrodisiac powder

00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:13.612
to spice things up

00:08:13.613 --> 00:08:15.492
between me and Lenghou Zong.

00:08:15.493 --> 00:08:17.094
But now,

00:08:17.133 --> 00:08:19.534
looks like it suits you better.

00:08:19.974 --> 00:08:21.414
I'll give it to you.

00:08:24.813 --> 00:08:25.774
What?

00:08:25.933 --> 00:08:26.932
Your sigil ended up

00:08:26.933 --> 00:08:28.252
on the hand of a mortal woman?

00:08:28.253 --> 00:08:29.213
It's formed from your

00:08:29.214 --> 00:08:30.612
most important reverse scale

00:08:30.613 --> 00:08:32.413
and holds the immense power
of Dragon God.

00:08:32.414 --> 00:08:34.932
It's your final safeguard
in the war against the Demons.

00:08:34.933 --> 00:08:35.773
So

00:08:35.774 --> 00:08:37.774
I need to find a way to get it back.

00:08:38.214 --> 00:08:40.093
I'll just kill her, then.

00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:42.772
When have we

00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:44.772
ever killed innocent humans?

00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:45.652
Young Master,

00:08:45.653 --> 00:08:47.173
since it was Nie Rongzhi

00:08:47.174 --> 00:08:48.573
who poisoned and hurt you,

00:08:48.613 --> 00:08:49.573
should we go back

00:08:49.574 --> 00:08:51.213
and report to His Majesty?

00:08:53.094 --> 00:08:54.173
Without solid proof,

00:08:54.174 --> 00:08:55.973
reporting to Father

00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:58.372
would only make him suspect
we're framing Rongzhi.

00:08:58.373 --> 00:08:59.453
Besides,

00:09:00.013 --> 00:09:01.732
the Yang poison in me isn't cleared yet.

00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:03.412
If I use the power of Dragon God,

00:09:03.413 --> 00:09:05.453
it'll only backfire worse.

00:09:05.974 --> 00:09:08.813
I won't be able to return to the sanctuary
to report to Father.

00:09:09.934 --> 00:09:11.012
Even though I can't

00:09:11.013 --> 00:09:12.894
take my sigil off her hand,

00:09:13.174 --> 00:09:15.053
every time I get close to her,

00:09:15.613 --> 00:09:17.612
the symptoms of the Yang poison

00:09:17.613 --> 00:09:19.213
seem to ease up a bit.

00:09:19.294 --> 00:09:20.252
She's just a mortal woman

00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:21.772
who knows a bit of medicine.

00:09:21.773 --> 00:09:23.252
She can't clear the Yang poison.

00:09:23.253 --> 00:09:24.412
The symptoms easing up

00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:26.053
must have something to do
with the sigil.

00:09:26.054 --> 00:09:26.612
Hey.

00:09:26.613 --> 00:09:27.772
I bet you're just jealous

00:09:27.773 --> 00:09:29.933
that Feng Zhilou
can help Young Master.

00:09:30.054 --> 00:09:31.774
Stop babbling.

00:09:33.253 --> 00:09:34.612
Nothing is certain yet.

00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:35.813
No matter what,

00:09:35.814 --> 00:09:37.894
we can't reveal our identities yet.

00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:39.213
Stay with me

00:09:39.214 --> 00:09:40.894
and watch Feng Zhilou for a while.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.612
(Jia Yu, Beggar of Feng Manor)
Zhilou.

00:09:49.613 --> 00:09:50.453
Zhilou.

00:09:54.054 --> 00:09:55.174
Zhilou...

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.374
The sigil senses danger.

00:10:12.294 --> 00:10:13.132
Zhilou,

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:15.134
Yunqiao sent me to make a baby with you.

00:10:15.174 --> 00:10:16.534
Look at me.

00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:18.414
Look at me.

00:10:30.094 --> 00:10:32.134
You showed up yourself, huh?

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:35.733
Get him!

00:10:58.694 --> 00:11:00.134
If you come any closer,

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:01.614
I'll kill you.

00:11:01.653 --> 00:11:02.732
I'll kill...

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:04.132
I'm Jia Yu.

00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:05.293
Please.

00:11:05.294 --> 00:11:06.173
Let me go.

00:11:06.174 --> 00:11:07.333
Don't fight me, alright?

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.532
I'll listen to you from now on.

00:11:08.533 --> 00:11:09.973
Please, Zhilou.

00:11:26.733 --> 00:11:27.453
Are you

00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:29.453
here to save me?

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:32.014
If anything happens to you,

00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:33.936
I'll lose my sigil.

00:11:33.937 --> 00:11:36.670
♪Like petals fall, gone with the clouds♪

00:11:36.825 --> 00:11:42.457
♪Like stars fade fast in open skies♪

00:11:44.174 --> 00:11:45.774
Put me down already.

00:11:45.775 --> 00:11:48.020
♪Like snowflakes melting softly
in the evening haze♪

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:52.933
♪Like your fleeting glance
that gave me one brief dream's grace♪

00:11:52.934 --> 00:11:55.294
Jia Yu and Feng Zhilou
are sleeping together inside.

00:11:58.025 --> 00:12:00.420
(Feng Qingfeng, Head of the Feng Family)

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.813
Well, well, Feng Zhilou.

00:12:03.934 --> 00:12:06.294
You're sleeping with a stranger here?

00:12:06.694 --> 00:12:08.372
Sir, who exactly are you?

00:12:08.373 --> 00:12:09.453
You broke into my house,

00:12:09.454 --> 00:12:10.933
hurt my people,

00:12:10.934 --> 00:12:12.774
and tried to take my daughter away?

00:12:12.974 --> 00:12:14.333
What are you trying to do?

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:16.213
I'm here to protect her, of course.

00:12:17.533 --> 00:12:18.532
Father,

00:12:18.533 --> 00:12:20.733
they don't look innocent at all.

00:12:21.133 --> 00:12:23.372
Like mother, like daughter, huh?

00:12:23.373 --> 00:12:24.853
You're as filthy as your mother.

00:12:24.854 --> 00:12:25.813
What did you say?

00:12:25.814 --> 00:12:27.053
Shut up.

00:12:32.174 --> 00:12:33.453
Feng Zhilou

00:12:33.493 --> 00:12:35.973
has always been a loser
without spiritual root.

00:12:36.373 --> 00:12:37.772
But after she met this man,

00:12:37.773 --> 00:12:39.414
her martial skills soared.

00:12:39.773 --> 00:12:41.294
I bet these two

00:12:41.454 --> 00:12:43.772
are already possessed by demons.

00:12:43.773 --> 00:12:45.654
Demon or fiend, either way,

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:47.853
they must be eradicated.

00:12:47.854 --> 00:12:48.973
Eradicate them.

00:12:48.974 --> 00:12:50.132
Eradicate them.

00:12:50.133 --> 00:12:51.612
Eradicate them!

00:12:51.613 --> 00:12:53.252
Eradicate them!

00:12:53.253 --> 00:12:54.494
Enough!

00:12:57.454 --> 00:12:59.134
He's just my patient.

00:13:01.174 --> 00:13:02.693
He's poisoned badly.

00:13:03.094 --> 00:13:04.973
I'm leaving Feng Manor with him

00:13:05.054 --> 00:13:06.654
to find an antidote.

00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:08.213
I swear,

00:13:08.493 --> 00:13:10.693
Zhilou has no trace of demonic energy.

00:13:10.694 --> 00:13:13.053
And that man is really poisoned.

00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:16.853
This is about the life and reputation
of our family.

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:17.853
This isn't

00:13:17.854 --> 00:13:20.014
your place to plead for her.

00:13:20.454 --> 00:13:21.654
Exactly.

00:13:21.773 --> 00:13:23.453
We can't let
this shameless couple get away.

00:13:23.454 --> 00:13:25.654
If there's any problem, take it out on me.

00:13:39.533 --> 00:13:40.693
Chu Moshang?

00:13:40.893 --> 00:13:42.053
Chu Moshang.

00:13:43.653 --> 00:13:44.774
Guards,

00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:47.053
lock them up separately.

00:13:47.054 --> 00:13:49.053
Don't let them leave Feng Manor.

00:13:49.334 --> 00:13:50.652
We'll talk

00:13:50.653 --> 00:13:52.134
about the execution tomorrow.

00:13:52.454 --> 00:13:53.614
Move it.

00:13:54.854 --> 00:13:55.774
Come on.

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:03.213
Young Master isn't back yet.

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:05.973
Do you think something happened to him?

00:14:05.974 --> 00:14:07.132
Should we go look for him?

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:07.892
He told us

00:14:07.893 --> 00:14:09.134
to wait here.

00:14:09.533 --> 00:14:11.014
You're really...

00:14:11.054 --> 00:14:12.534
Such a stubborn blockhead.

00:14:13.054 --> 00:14:14.892
I just follow orders.

00:14:14.893 --> 00:14:16.654
Young Master has his own plan.

00:14:21.334 --> 00:14:22.252
Zhilou

00:14:22.253 --> 00:14:24.494
has developed a spiritual root.

00:14:24.574 --> 00:14:26.012
This...

00:14:26.013 --> 00:14:27.612
probably can't be kept a secret anymore.

00:14:27.613 --> 00:14:28.733
Qingfeng,

00:14:29.013 --> 00:14:30.412
Zhilou has struggled

00:14:30.413 --> 00:14:31.973
for so many years because she had

00:14:31.974 --> 00:14:33.453
no spiritual root.

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:36.294
Are you really going
to let her keep suffering?

00:14:36.773 --> 00:14:38.252
That foreign man

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:39.333
has amazing martial skills

00:14:39.334 --> 00:14:40.973
and was protecting Zhilou.

00:14:41.613 --> 00:14:44.093
Maybe we should let them go.

00:14:46.133 --> 00:14:47.254
Qingyun,

00:14:48.174 --> 00:14:49.534
promise me,

00:14:49.974 --> 00:14:52.333
no matter what happens,

00:14:52.893 --> 00:14:54.134
you'll take good care

00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:56.573
of Zhilou for me.

00:14:59.094 --> 00:15:00.494
Everyone,

00:15:00.814 --> 00:15:02.294
you've seen it yourselves.

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:03.652
My father

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:04.933
is indecisive

00:15:04.934 --> 00:15:07.534
and keeps covering for Feng Zhilou.

00:15:07.653 --> 00:15:09.134
If this keeps up,

00:15:09.253 --> 00:15:11.973
not only will the Lenghou family
look down on us,

00:15:12.174 --> 00:15:13.372
but everyone in the world

00:15:13.373 --> 00:15:15.494
will laugh at us.

00:15:15.694 --> 00:15:16.774
By then,

00:15:16.854 --> 00:15:19.174
how can we do business

00:15:19.214 --> 00:15:21.534
or stand our ground in the world?

00:15:21.653 --> 00:15:23.733
That disgraceful woman

00:15:24.294 --> 00:15:27.093
needs to be punished
according to family rules.

00:15:28.413 --> 00:15:29.853
Drown her.

00:15:30.214 --> 00:15:31.733
Make an example out of her.

00:15:31.893 --> 00:15:34.573
Get rid of this shame in our family

00:15:34.694 --> 00:15:37.374
and have Yunqiao marry
into the Lenghou family

00:15:37.493 --> 00:15:39.014
to seal the alliance.

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.494
Father,

00:15:59.253 --> 00:16:01.134
I made you some soup.

00:16:07.893 --> 00:16:09.254
(Father,)

00:16:09.574 --> 00:16:12.294
(get a good night's sleep tomorrow.)

00:16:18.733 --> 00:16:21.012
The second daughter of the Feng family,

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:22.254
Feng Zhilou,

00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:24.813
is already betrothed

00:16:24.934 --> 00:16:27.973
but shamelessly involved
with a foreign man,

00:16:27.974 --> 00:16:29.693
ruining the family's reputation.

00:16:29.694 --> 00:16:31.492
Her sins are grave.

00:16:31.493 --> 00:16:33.654
She must be executed.

00:16:34.773 --> 00:16:36.774
Drown Feng Zhilou in the pond.
