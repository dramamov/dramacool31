00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Let's go.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.680
I'm home.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.120
Hurry and dry your hair.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.080
Don't catch a cold.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.800
I'll head out now.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.760
Wait a second.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.440
Take off your wet clothes.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920
I'll return them after washing.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.640
Thanks. You should go home.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.640
Su Ruo.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.680
You don't need to worry.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.160
My uncle will be home these days.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.400
Sorry about that.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400
I didn't notice just now.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.720
What is this feeling?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.800
I actually fell asleep here.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.360
So it really was a dream.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.680
But this dream felt so real.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.640
What's wrong?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.080
Come to the police station.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.480
This is from the day Su Ruo had the accident.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.160
Surveillance footage from the neighborhood.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.640
This person.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.240
Followed Su Ruo into this building.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.800
Didn't come out until the next morning.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.680
Do you remember him?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.920
You've seen him before.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.800
I have.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.240
When was that?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.120
I had a dream about going back in time.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.040
He showed up in that dream.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.720
We're investigating. Don't joke around.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.120
I'm being serious.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.960
The reason I asked you here—

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.120
First, you were her last visitor.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.040
Second—

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.400
I remember you're very observant.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.600
Observant? What do you mean?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.440
When Su Ruo's parents passed away—

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.880
No one in class noticed.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.360
Even Lao Jiang didn't know.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.480
Only you saw she was upset.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.160
She stayed late to finish homework that day.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.600
I think I saw from outside—

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.040
You were talking to her.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.560
Were you comforting her?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.600
When did you all

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.320
find out about Su Ruo's parents passing?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.280
After National Day.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.640
That's impossible.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.520
You told me yourself.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.200
By the time everyone knew,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.760
months had already passed.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.800
When did I ever tell you that?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.920
You must've forgotten.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.600
Lao Jiang knew the day after the accident.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760
Later,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.160
he sent Su Ruo away

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.360
and told the whole class

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.120
that something happened to Su Ruo's family.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.560
Teacher Jiang.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.520
Su Ruo's parents died in a car accident.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.960
He asked everyone to comfort her for a while.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.400
Did I really go back in time?

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.400
So was it a dream or not?

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.120
According to the Grandfather paradox,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
I must've entered a parallel world.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.160
Only the two of us from our class came.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.480
It's been years since graduation.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.400
Everyone has their own life now.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.920
Oh right, Zhang Jie is here.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.040
Your deskmate.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.760
She was that close with Su Ruo?

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.200
She—

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.480
works here.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.400
Is she Su Ruo's aunt?

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.040
Su Ruo's memorial is over there.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.200
Class President.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.760
Thanks for your hard work.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.520
Just doing my job.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.160
Long time no see.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.280
Didn't expect you to work here.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.720
What a coincidence.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.880
Is there a problem?

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.360
No problem at all.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.640
Isn't this pretty good?

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.800
Everyone ends up here eventually.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.720
I'll try to stay as long as I can.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.360
Until you come by.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.160
It's starting.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.720
Over here.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.960
You didn't have breakfast, did you?

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.400
Thank you.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.720
Back in school,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.000
lots of boys in class

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.840
would secretly bring Su Ruo extra breakfast.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.640
They'd stuff it in her desk.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.080
So when Su Ruo arrived at school,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.520
her drawer was always packed full.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.040
But those who brought breakfast

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.240
didn't show up today.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.880
Yeah.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.960
No one came.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.840
You two talk first.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.760
I'll go see if anyone over there needs help.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.360
She's up there now.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080
Take a good look.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.000
One last look.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760
All these years,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.520
I haven't reached out to you.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.560
You...

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.200
Are you still in touch
with Hui Ge?

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:14.960
Zhang Jie.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920
I've wanted to apologize to you
all these years.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.360
Actually, Hui Ge never replied
to me back then.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.560
I was the one who lost the letter.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.640
I know.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.080
I'm sorry.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.160
It's all in the past.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.840
Back then, you only had Su Ruo
in your heart.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.760
I understand.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.600
If I could do it over,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.600
I would never lie to you.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.760
I'd make sure to give the letter
to Hui Ge.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.280
There's really no need.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.560
It's been so many years.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.680
I don't want to talk to you now.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.520
It's not because I'm mad at you.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.120
I just don't see the point.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.280
I remember back then,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.040
you and Zhang Jie were close.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.480
I messed up.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.000
What happened between you two?

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.600
Senior year of high school,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.880
Zhang Jie gave me a love letter.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.480
She said it was for Hui Ge.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.560
She was too shy back then,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.280
so she asked me to pass it on.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.880
But I lost that love letter.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.160
Lost it.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.800
I put the letter in my pocket
at the time.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.880
It was hot.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.440
So I tied my jacket
around my waist.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.800
I think that's when
the letter got lost.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.360
What are you looking for?

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.520
You came at the right time.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.840
Let me ask you something.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.120
Answer me seriously.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.880
Don't ask.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.840
I didn't do well on the test.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.000
I only got second place.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.360
Just one point behind first.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.480
Second place is the biggest loser.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.120
Who asked you about that?

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.240
I'm asking you.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.720
You know Zhang Jie, right?

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.960
Zhang Jie from our class.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.800
She said she likes you.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.880
Sociologically or biologically?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.000
Biologically.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.120
The kind sped up by hormones.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.240
What does that have to do with me?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.520
An egg against a rock.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.800
The force on the rock
is negligible.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.440
So,

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.600
the egg against a rock itself

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.520
has nothing to do with the rock.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:17.960
Hui Ge said

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.200
he doesn't like you.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.160
He read my letter.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.600
He read it.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.440
He read it.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.560
He knows now.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.600
Goodbye.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.840
Since then,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.920
she never replied to my messages.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.360
She wouldn't answer my calls.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.720
I went to apologize to her.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.720
She ignored me too.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.240
Sounds pretty harsh.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.880
I think I went too far, too.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.440
That's not what I meant.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.280
Yu Xingchen.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.840
Let's get some classmates together
sometime.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.120
I just feel Su Ruo's funeral

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.800
was too lonely.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.560
Funerals are always lonely.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.400
Have you only been to
lonely ones?

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.200
Remember senior year?

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.000
You cooked a whole table
of dishes.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.880
For me and your mom.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.800
How many dishes did you make?

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.080
Boiled fish slices,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.680
stir-fried pork with green pepper,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.320
lettuce with oyster sauce,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.200
chives with dried tofu,

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.120
and...

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.800
tomato and egg soup.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.880
Right, right.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.960
Young people have
better memories.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.800
And back then,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.480
you seemed so skilled.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.040
Like you'd lived alone
for years.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.880
After all these years,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.560
I've only cooked for you two
that one time.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.440
But you still remember.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.280
Your wedding with Meixian Ayi.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.040
I'll be there.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.160
About the wedding,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.480
you don't need to handle it.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.400
Meixian Ayi has a daughter.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.880
Her name is Ning Jing.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.920
She'll take care of it.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.320
You must trust our work.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.360
You can't just suspect people.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.920
Young man,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.960
everyone entering or leaving
needs to register.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.160
It's you.
