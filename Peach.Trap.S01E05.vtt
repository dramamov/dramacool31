I've been looking at them for a long time.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.650
Looks like you have a date tonight.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.070
Yes, you can say so.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.670
Thank you.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.120
Enjoy.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.170
Eat it while it's hot.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:14.820
Okay.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.350
Is something bothering you?

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.400
What?

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.900
You seem to be thinking about something.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.700
Ah... That's not it.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.780
Tell me what's on your mind.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.520
I'll pretend you didn't tell me about it.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.670
Whether it's work or anything else.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.570
It's okay. Tell me.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:04.970
Mr. Jeon...

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.350
No.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.020
Mr. Yeonsang?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.020
Hyung?

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.480
You're good at everything.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.000
You must be good at things like

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.800
liking someone

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.400
or dating, right?

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.880
I've never been in a relationship,

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.350
so I don't know what to do.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.950
I find it difficult, too.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.200
I want to look good in front of someone,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.400
so I took him to my favorite restaurant.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.670
But the owner is an old lady,

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.930
so I was worried that he might not like it,

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.600
so I was wondering if
I should go to a fancy restaurant instead.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.600
Oh, right.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.400
The person you mentioned just now...

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:29.550
Yes.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.920
That person is you.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.270
But now,

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.670
I'm going to do something
I've never done before.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:04.900
Yoo Doha,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.550
I really like you.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.620
[Stay tuned for the epilogue]

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.980
[Peach Trap]

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.670
Mr. Yeonsang.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.650
How did you fall in love with Mr. Doha?

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.770
Your coffee's ready.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.870
Thank you.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.270
Mr. Jeon!

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.370
Are you okay?

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.600
I'm fine.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.950
I wanted to treat you to coffee.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.950
You injured your chin.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.180
But the coffee is all spilled.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.770
Because he's pretty when he smiles.
