00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.639
In such a rush to get yourself killed?

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.279
Are you all right?

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.119
Turns out it's those damn bastards.

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:56.520
So these people are Japanese?

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:58.279
Let's get out of here first.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.519
Thinking about it now,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.400
the marks of hidden weapons in his room

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:09.599
must be shuriken used by Japanese ninjas.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:11.120
So it seems

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.599
the ones who killed Luo Yurong and Brother Dog

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.279
were also these Japanese.

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:15.279
I didn't expect

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.599
they'd be involved in this.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.760
Looks like Luo Yurong

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.440
came to this village searching for something

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:21.519
that was truly important.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.000
I've already asked the patrol office

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.400
to send someone to report to the county office.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.519
Hope Yiru can find them soon.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.080
But I'm afraid

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.040
they've already stolen the item.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.080
If they got the item,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.440
there's no reason to follow us.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.720
The item must still be here.

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:39.040
We just don't know where it's hidden.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.639
But what

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.919
are they really looking for?

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:46.599
This is a turtle shell.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:47.519
Also called turtle plastron.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.839
Ordinary folks use it

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:50.120
to nourish yin and subdue yang,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.440
strengthen kidneys and bones.

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:55.800
No need for your explanation.

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.080
What I mean is,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.160
this is what Luo Yurong

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.800
came to buy every day.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:02.519
Isn't he a tomb raider?

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:04.480
Why would he buy turtle shells?

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.319
What else could he do?

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.239
People like them

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.360
use this for divination,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800
to predict fortune or disaster,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.919
and to locate tombs.

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:11.240
I've seen plenty of tomb raiders,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.240
several groups, in fact.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.160
But I've never seen

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.199
a tomb raider with your style.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.839
At first glance,

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.399
you're clearly a master.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.279
I'm not.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:20.600
You must've

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.039
made a lot of silver, right?

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:24.880
What are you doing?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.479
What do you think I'm doing?

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.520
What do you think I'm doing?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.279
Where's the money?

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:35.600
That's all you've got?

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:37.039
My medical bills

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.479
cost me several taels of silver.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.880
You have to pay me back.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.240
Or I'll kill you.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.520
If you help me find the treasure,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.160
I'll give you

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.240
five taels of silver.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.559
Don't be scared.

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.199
I was just joking with you.

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.000
These three books

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
are works on epigraphy and calligraphy.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.600
And these two

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.639
are children's primers.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.679
They don't fit together.

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:05.320
He definitely didn't read these himself.

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.479
During Luo Yurong's two months here,

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.000
who did he associate with most?

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.000
It was Brother Dog

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.839
and his beggar brother.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.919
The two of them

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.960
seemed to work for Mr. Luo.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.800
So they often came here for food.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.440
Usually, they

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.080
ate over there.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.839
Mr. Luo,

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.880
one's a rascal,

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.320
the other's a little beggar.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.240
They're just freeloaders.

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:36.520
You'd better be careful.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.479
You little bastard.

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:40.679
Always making jokes all day.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.479
Jokes? What jokes?

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.119
Trying to show off, huh?

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:44.679
Why don't you just fly to the sky?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.360
Did I say anything about you?

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:49.720
I invited them to eat.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.520
Take it and eat.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.759
He owes this to me, your big brother.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:58.320
Eat.

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:02.440
Hey, Luo,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.720
tell me,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.320
did you really find that big tomb

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.160
or are you lying?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.279
If you dare lie,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.520
Got it, got it.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.520
We're digging up a big tomb,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.320
so we should keep a low profile.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.640
Were you a starving ghost reborn?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.799
Go get yourself some water.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.640
Hopeless case.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.760
Hey, you,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.399
pour me some water.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.799
What are you doing just sitting there?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.239
Is this your little brother?

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:35.399
A stray kid you picked up off the street.

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.920
Let's get to business.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.239
Can you tell me

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.000
the tomb we're digging up—

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.320
what era is it from?

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:45.320
Qin or Han.

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.279
Don't tell me

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.760
it's from the Spring and Autumn period?

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.839
Even earlier.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.119
Here—

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:13.839
is where Luo Yurong

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:15.600
was turned into a human scarecrow, right?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.279
Just like in Brother Dog's dream,

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.679
it's exactly the same tomb raiding spot.

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:23.720
Could there really be something evil here?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.119
He Fuyi,

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:28.200
look, it's already so dark.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.399
Why don't we come back at dawn?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.279
The soil's moisture here

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.679
is clearly different from the rest.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.600
This spot was freshly buried.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:38.839
There's definitely something wrong underneath.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.839
He's coming around.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.320
He suffered such a serious stab wound.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:08.880
And still managed to survive.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.200
It's truly heaven's blessing.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.079
I'll go prepare more medicine.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.239
Thank you for your trouble.

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:18.399
It's more than that.

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:20.239
He doesn't even know

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.040
how long you were buried alive.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.600
To survive that...

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:26.600
All the gods must've blessed you.

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.239
I couldn't move the lid.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.119
So I kept pounding on it.

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:33.040
No idea how long I kept at it.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.279
Somehow,

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.799
I just crawled out and grabbed you.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.239
Because the coffin was old,

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:43.640
and we happened to loosen the soil nearby.

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:45.519
That's how you saw daylight again.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.720
If we hadn't dug the grave today,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.320
you probably wouldn't have made it.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.040
Seems your luck is pretty good.

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:51.880
Tell us,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.119
what really happened?

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.799
Right.

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:58.920
Some bad people were after Mr. Luo.

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:00.600
My big brother...

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:01.119
I...

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.600
Don't rush.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.720
Take your time.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.000
Start from the beginning.

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:09.959
This character...

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.399
It's pronounced "Yi."

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:14.760
That's right.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.160
This is "Yi."

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.799
At the very beginning,

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.399
the Dao stands on "one."

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.799
It divides heaven and earth.

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:22.320
And transforms into all things.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.679
This is the start

00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:26.160
and the foundation of everything.

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:27.239
Sir...

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.079
Then I'll be called Yiyi from now on.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.640
Of course you can.

00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:32.239
Yiyi...

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.679
Look at you now—

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:35.239
you've learned to write your own name.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.880
Learning characters isn't so hard, right?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.720
But I'm just a little beggar.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.519
No one thinks much of me.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.720
Can I really learn to read?

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.119
Yiyi, look—

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.799
what's that?

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320
A patch of rotten grass.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.200
That's right.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.440
A messy, dirty tangle of floating weeds.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:00.519
It seems completely useless.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.760
But do you know—

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.160
fireflies

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:05.359
are born right in there.

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:06.679
Fireflies—

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:09.519
even the most ordinary rotten grass

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:12.480
can nurture life that shines in the night sky.

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:14.720
So others can't define you.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.480
What matters most

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.200
is what you think in your heart.

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:21.279
Yiyi...

00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:23.640
What kind of person do you want to be?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:24.920
I...

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.359
I want to learn to read.

00:08:29.359 --> 00:08:30.160
I want to study.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.320
I want to walk proudly down the street.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.080
And I want my big brother to always have enough to eat.

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.080
Because ever since he took me in,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.039
he's had to share his food with me.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.719
So he's never full.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.119
You're truly a good child.

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:46.200
By the way, sir—

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.440
my big brother is just like me,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.320
we're both orphans.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.000
Can you give him a name too?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.280
Who says I don't have a name?

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:53.640
I'm called Brother Dog.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.559
Brother Dog...

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:01.119
What's the difference between a big dog and a little beggar?

00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:02.479
They're just names people blurt out.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.440
Besides,

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:05.919
the stray dog in town is called Big Yellow.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:08.119
Are you really comparing your brother to a dog?

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:08.960
Give me the hat.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.400
Give it here.

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:10.599
You're so talkative.

00:09:20.719 --> 00:09:21.520
Old Luo

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.039
Tonight,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.320
where are we digging next?

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.200
No need to go.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.200
I'm leaving soon.

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:29.520
Yiyi

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.599
Come here.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.919
These

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.000
are for you.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.320
No, no.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.799
You just said you're leaving soon.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.760
No.

00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:39.320
We haven't found anything.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.239
Why are you leaving?

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:41.400
What about the promised treasure?

00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:43.320
The things in that coffin

00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:45.039
are the treasure I was after.

00:09:47.719 --> 00:09:49.280
Just those broken turtle shells?

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.119
What kind of tomb raider are you?

00:09:51.119 --> 00:09:52.320
I'm not a tomb raider.

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.919
I never said I was a tomb raider.

00:09:55.719 --> 00:09:56.599
But those oracle bones

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.719
are genuine treasures.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.799
Treasure, treasure, treasure.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.400
I...

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:04.400
These

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.520
are for you, Yiyi.

00:10:06.599 --> 00:10:07.520
Is it this one?

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:08.320
Mr. Luo

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.080
You left me a treasure?

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.159
Yes.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.320
These

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.359
are just a keepsake for you.

00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:15.840
The number of oracle bones

00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:17.880
far exceeded my expectations.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.520
You're bullying me too.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.479
Are you bullying me too?

00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:21.280
Maybe now isn't the best time.

00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:23.119
But none of that matters.

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:24.679
What matters is

00:10:25.119 --> 00:10:27.159
it proves our national culture

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:28.599
is so ancient.

00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:29.880
It also proves we have

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.400
the courage to face hardship

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.520
and the means to shape our future.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.520
Yiyi,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.039
this is our National Treasure.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.640
Brother, don't do this.

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:45.880
You bastard.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.400
So you were playing me.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.320
What about the money you owe me?

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.119
When will you pay?

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.320
Brother,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.520
don't treat Mr. Luo like this.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.119
Get lost.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:52.919
Brother Dog, don't panic.

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:54.080
I'm your Dog Lord.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.000
I'll pay you back for sure.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.640
This is the written promise I left you.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.799
Did I say you could talk?

00:10:58.799 --> 00:10:59.840
Shut your mouth.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.359
Get lost.

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:01.679
This is the written promise I left you.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.320
Once I get back to town and get the money,

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.599
I'll give you all five taels of silver

00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:05.320
for sure.

00:11:05.719 --> 00:11:06.799
What is this?

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.640
I get it now.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.280
You're just stringing me along with this.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.640
Forget the money you owe me.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.080
Don't let me see you again.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.799
Get lost.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.520
Take the box.

00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:31.520
Let's go.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.440
Goodbye, Mr. Luo.

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:34.520
Stop dawdling here.

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:38.520
Brother Dog,

00:11:39.039 --> 00:11:40.880
I'll pay you back for sure.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.919
You little brat.

00:11:46.719 --> 00:11:48.440
You've only known him a few days.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.719
And you're already calling him Mr. Luo.

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:52.440
Don't forget who raised you.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.919
Ungrateful pig.

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:54.880
You're the ungrateful one.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.919
At least I have a conscience.

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:56.719
Still talking back?

00:11:56.719 --> 00:11:57.880
I'll kick you to death.

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:11.520
Just now,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.520
were you talking about

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:13.719
oracle bones?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.679
Hand them over.

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:22.119
Give them to me.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.520
Don't give them to him.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.719
This is mine.

00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:30.039
Give it back.

00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:32.200
Give it back.

00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:33.239
Sir,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.799
there's a whole coffin full of these.

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:37.400
If you really want them,

00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:38.400
then

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.880
name your price.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.080
You're not in a position to bargain.

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:50.320
What are you doing?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.799
Wait, wait, he's just a kid.

00:12:56.239 --> 00:12:57.000
Brother,

00:12:57.919 --> 00:12:58.640
Brother,

00:12:59.119 --> 00:12:59.919
It's okay, it's okay.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.799
Kneel, kneel.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.200
Sir,

00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:06.000
I'll be honest with you.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.960
These aren't mine.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.960
They belong to

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.400
someone named Luo Yurong.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.799
He's been searching for them.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.599
He's leaving today.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.119
If you don't hurry and catch him,

00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:16.440
he might take these

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.239
and leave.

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:19.080
Luo Yurong?

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:22.719
That Epigrapher?

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:23.400
Yes.

00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:25.200
Brother, you can't betray Mr. Luo.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.599
Can you shut your mouth?

00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:29.679
Sir,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.840
this Luo Yurong

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.599
has been studying these oracle bones.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.119
How about this:

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.919
I'll take you to find this Luo.

00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:43.000
Turtle shell—

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:45.840
Look closely again.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.359
What's carved on it?

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.640
The twenty-fifth year of Guangxu

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:01.799
Someone discovered on the oracle bones

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.320
carvings of unreadable symbols

00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:05.000
After research, it was found

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.719
this was a script older than scriptures

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.640
probably originating from the Yin-Shang era

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:12.599
I remember now

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:14.559
I think it's called

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.200
called

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.080
oracle bone script

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.719
It's the origin and root of Chinese characters

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:22.440
Right

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.799
Darn it

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:27.520
This is a real treasure

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.280
Looks like Luo Yurong was searching for this shell

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.679
oracle bone script

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.919
and got killed by those Yamato people

00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:37.640
Whenever there's something good

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.200
they always come to snatch it

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.320
But

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.719
Why is there only this one piece?

00:14:50.119 --> 00:14:51.679
Your servant greets you, Prince

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:54.039
Yiru, oh Yiru

00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:56.359
Why are you always

00:14:56.359 --> 00:14:57.440
so punctual every time you show up?

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:03.280
Don't bother

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.320
I won't answer any of your questions

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.280
nor am I afraid of any torture

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.960
We Yamato warriors

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.440
are fierce and fearless of death

00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:13.000
Yes

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:15.119
You are proud warriors

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.520
not afraid to die

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:20.679
but love to steal things

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.280
Enough

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.320
I don't care who you serve

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.320
So many of you made a fuss

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.719
and found nothing in the end

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:36.599
fooled by a frail scholar

00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:38.280
Aren't you ashamed?

00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:42.000
If we had arrived a bit earlier

00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:43.039
just a little earlier

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:45.840
before Luo Yurong hid the item

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:47.119
if we had gotten here

00:15:47.719 --> 00:15:49.359
it would have been settled

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.440
Boss

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.320
Didn't you catch Luo Yurong?

00:15:54.719 --> 00:15:56.039
Just ask him

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.679
He's very timid

00:15:57.919 --> 00:15:58.799
If he doesn't confess

00:15:58.799 --> 00:15:59.880
just hit him a couple times

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:01.039
he'll spill everything for sure

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.280
He's tough as nails

00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:05.359
Not only does he refuse to tell the truth

00:16:06.479 --> 00:16:08.359
he even tricked us into digging all night

00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:10.880
I'm not in the mood to waste time on him

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.919
You found the oracle bone with him

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.880
You must have some clues

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.919
Did something happen to Mr. Luo?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.919
Why are you so reasonable?

00:16:19.919 --> 00:16:20.640
If we can't find the oracle bone

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.599
we're doomed too

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.880
Keep your mouth shut

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:26.320
Boss, I promise I'll find the oracle bone for you

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.520
There's a saying in your country

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.119
"A wise man adapts to the times"

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:34.919
You're smarter than Luo Yurong

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.039
He's a foreigner

00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:36.679
Brother

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:37.719
Mr. Luo said

00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:39.400
the oracle bone is our national treasure

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:40.640
We can't let them have it

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.440
can't hand it over to them

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.320
Shut up

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.159
Boss

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.760
He's just a clueless kid

00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:46.760
I'll take you to look again now

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.559
I promise I'll find the oracle bone for you

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:49.200
No

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.960
That's our country's property

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.400
You can't steal it

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.119
You're robbers

00:16:53.119 --> 00:16:54.440
No, no, boss, boss

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.320
No, no

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.320
Boss, no, no

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.239
Eyesore

00:17:00.599 --> 00:17:01.400
Annoying

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.239
No

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:18.599
Yiyi

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.400
Yiyi

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.319
Yiyi

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.400
Yiyi

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.719
Yiyi

00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:28.000
Take care of the body

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.520
Boss

00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:35.479
Boss

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.439
No need to search

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.599
No need to search

00:17:41.599 --> 00:17:42.359
He probably

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.000
long ago

00:17:44.199 --> 00:17:45.199
moved the treasure

00:17:45.319 --> 00:17:46.319
to another place

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.319
It's been moved

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.160
Old Luo

00:18:12.439 --> 00:18:13.239
Old Luo

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.479
Brother Dog

00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:17.599
is in danger

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.599
Hurry, take Yiyi

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:20.800
and go

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:26.920
Scared now

00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:28.920
You betrayed him

00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:30.000
Not me

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.719
Not me, not me, not me

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.599
If you can't find the oracle bone

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.119
you'll end up the same

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.359
Boss, boss, boss

00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:41.239
I'm begging you

00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:42.520
I'm begging you

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.839
Give me, give me a chance

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.119
I'm pretty close to him

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.359
Let me go ask him

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.319
I can definitely find out where the oracle bone is

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.839
Don't try any tricks

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.880
Yes, yes, yes

00:19:08.199 --> 00:19:09.199
Boss, boss

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.000
I got the answer

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.839
I—I already found out where the oracle bone is

00:19:13.199 --> 00:19:15.719
But I did help out this time

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.560
After this

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.599
can I get a little reward?
