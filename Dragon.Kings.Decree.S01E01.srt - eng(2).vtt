00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.120
(Feng Zhilou,
Illegitimate Daughter of Feng Family)

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.319
Snow in June?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.478
That's a bad omen.

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.238
Looks like another demon
is about to show up.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.478
The Feng family is really unlucky
to have a walking disaster

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.239
like Feng Zhilou.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.238
(I have no spiritual root,)

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.519
(so I suffered endless humiliation)

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:38.360
(Feng Yunqiao, Legitimate Daughter of Feng Family)
(and became the Feng-Lenghou)

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.559
(Lenghou Zong, Young Master of Lenghou Family)
(marriage alliance's sacrifice.)

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.678
(Feng Yunqiao and Lenghou Zong
are already together,)

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.839
(so I've decided
to break the engagement.)

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.358
(I have to find a way)

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.720
(to leave Feng Manor
as soon as possible.)

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.478
(Zhilou,)

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.358
(I can't help you much.)

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.119
(Feng Qingyun, Physician of Feng Manor)
(can only teach you medicine.)

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.400
(Even if you can't
cultivate martial arts,)

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.759
(you still have a way to make a living.)

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.280
(It's always better
to rely on yourself than anyone else.)

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.558
Thank you for always

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:33.280
protecting the mortal realm, Moshang.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.879
I'm here on Father's orders
to bring you back

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.279
to the Dragons' sanctuary

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.759
to marry Wujing Saintess
of the mortal realm.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.699
(Nie Rongzhi, Dragon King's Second Son)
and stabilize the sanctuary's barrier.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.199
Demonic energy is invading.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.999
Our battle against the Demons

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.600
is a matter of life and death.

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.999
This concerns all life in the world.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.759
I can't believe
what Dragon King's Decree states.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.999
Only through the union
of the Dragons and Wujing Saintess

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.960
can the sanctuary's barrier
be preserved

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:01.400
and all life be protected.

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.559
Nie Rongzhi.

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.840
Ever since you were announced
as Dragon King's heir,

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.080
our competition

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.840
has already started.

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.319
(I should mind my own business.)

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.239
Let go.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.918
Who are you?

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.839
Why did you suddenly

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.879
show up in my yard?

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:40.999
My sigil.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.679
What sigil?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.998
You look all normal.

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:48.920
You're not a fraud, are you?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.159
I'm warning you,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.399
if you don't leave right now,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400
I'll...

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.199
How did my sigil end up on you?

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.480
What's this?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.720
(Why is the sigil)

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.999
(of the Dragons' power on her hand?)

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.400
The breaking of the barrier
is getting worse.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.918
The sanctuary won't hold much longer.

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.080
Father.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.438
Father, please send someone
to save Moshang.

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.878
He was seriously hurt by the Demons,

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.118
and now he's missing.

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:41.679
With Shang's cultivation level,

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.119
(Dragon King)
the Demons couldn't have hurt him.

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.599
It's all my fault.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.878
I followed your orders to go

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.998
to the mortal realm to bring him back.

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.839
But I didn't expect

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.798
the mortal realm to be invaded
by demonic energy.

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:54.199
When I got there,

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:56.119
Moshang was badly wounded

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:57.759
and mentally unstable.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.878
He then went missing.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.798
I was ambushed by the Demons too

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:02.639
and couldn't catch up with him.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.558
Fei Yuan, Bai Lu, listen up.

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:05.719
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.719
Head to the mortal realm

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.719
and find out where Shang is.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.958
We Dragons must never fall into
the hands of ordinary mortals.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:14.080
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.320
(Even if they find Chu Moshang,)

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.239
(he's afflicted by the Yang poison.)

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.399
(There's no way he'll survive.)

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.239
What is this thing?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.560
Why won't it come off?

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:07.480
What are you trying to do?

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.960
I was going to scrape off your rotten flesh
to put some medicine on it.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.239
I gave you some medicine

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.560
to stabilize your energy.

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:18.879
See, getting worked up

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.200
made it worse.

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:24.480
You've got Yang poison in you.
Did you know that?

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:25.798
This poison is really rare.

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:27.639
I've only seen it in medical books.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.279
If the Yang poison flares up,

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.958
your meridians will burst,
and you'll die.

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:32.080
Ridiculous.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.479
A mortal trying to decide
if I live or die?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.159
I'm a physician.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.840
You need to trust me.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.039
But I can't promise

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.999
I can completely clear the Yang poison.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.598
Right now, I can only help

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.279
slow the poison's spread.

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:48.159
If you don't believe me,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.399
you can just leave it,

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:50.798
but you might not make it

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:51.960
through the night.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.999
Zhilou.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.119
Stop right there.

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.359
You have the nerve to show up here?
You're not welcome.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.279
I brought some rare herbs

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.678
to visit you.

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:05.720
Lenghou Zong,

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:06.918
it's just the two of us here.

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.639
There's no need to act in front of me.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.359
I know perfectly well

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.759
what you're scheming.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.319
Isn't it normal for men to have multiple

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.600
wives and concubines?

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:18.440
You should accept reality.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.999
Not much to look at,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.958
yet you're acting like a player.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.480
Don't pester me anymore.

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:27.639
Feng Zhilou!

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.359
I was only polite to you

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.919
because you have some looks.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:33.639
Don't push it.

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.598
Well then, I'll give up my looks.

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:36.318
You can have it

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.759
since you have none.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.078
Forget marrying you,

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.399
even standing next to you here

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.279
disgusts me.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.399
Bah!

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:43.558
Wench.

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:45.279
I'm going to show you

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.680
who your husband is today.

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:48.159
Even if I die,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.039
I'd never marry you.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.399
You filthy wench.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.119
You're hiding a man?

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.119
(Mortals with such weak martial skills)

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.320
(can't go against me.)

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.359
You're poisoned.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.840
You can't use your energy.

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:04.239
I'm just protecting my sigil.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.918
(Moshang,)

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:10.918
(enjoy the Yang poison.)

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:12.359
(I'll be watching you)

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.239
(as you melt into a puddle of goo.)

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.798
(Without my sigil,)

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:25.320
(even a mortal weapon could hurt me.)

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:29.759
Why...

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.239
Why are you standing up again?

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.639
How can I get it back?

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:38.239
I'll say it again,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.320
I don't want what's not mine.

00:09:40.439 --> 00:09:41.879
If you want your treasure back,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.759
get that poison under control first.

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:45.800
Clothes off.

00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:47.440
I'm going to apply the medicine.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.119
Go on, take it off.

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:03.279
Are you like from a prominent family?

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.159
Fine.

00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:38.598
♪Like stars fade fast in open skies♪

00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:40.480
You're seriously hurt.

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:43.558
You're not a Demon, are you?

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:44.639
Mortal,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.039
how dare you compare me to the Demons?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.720
I'll apply the medicine.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.639
I don't think you're just poisoned.

00:10:53.079 --> 00:10:54.308
Why are you calling me a mortal?

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.370
Does it hurt?

00:10:57.371 --> 00:10:59.941
♪Like fireflies flicker

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.999
Um,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.440
my name's Feng Zhilou.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.279
What's your name?

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.759
Shang, like those who fall

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:39.919
in battle protecting all life
in the world.

00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:42.159
Chu Moshang.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.600
Done.

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:50.638
Do you remember

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:52.278
anything strange happening
before the sigil

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.479
showed up on your hand?

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.879
If we can recreate it,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.599
maybe I can take the sigil back.

00:11:58.559 --> 00:11:59.999
It was

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:02.080
snowing heavily that day.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.560
I wanted to save you.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.719
Wait.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.999
It's summer now.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.400
How could it be snowing?

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.680
How do we recreate that?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.999
Do we need to wait till winter?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.879
No need.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.081
Your martial skill can create snow?

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560
Let's give it a try.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.040
We're just going...

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:37.599
to stand here and wait?

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:49.879
(He actually looks quite decent.)
