00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.200
You mean...

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.360
at the same time and place next time,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.920
I should try again?

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.240
As a reader, let me give you a tip.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.880
Okay, thank you so much.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.440
Every time you travel,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.680
you're not returning to the past of world A.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.160
Instead, you travel to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.440
the past of a parallel world B you created.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.040
So you can think of it as

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.480
everything in world A keeps happening

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.080
just as before, even when you return.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.520
The girl you like,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.280
in world A,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.120
will still die.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.320
Also,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.240
quantum information reverse dissipation at Planck scale

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.120
will damage memory and lifespan.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.000
The car's here.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.080
Starting to write novels halfway through life,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.560
making such a detailed outline isn't easy.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:08.880
Good luck.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.120
Thanks.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.920
I work at a funeral home.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.160
I see so many people leave every day.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.400
But Su Ruo's death still makes me so sad.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.360
I just think it's such a shame.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.880
She was such a wonderful person.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.840
You know,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.000
I think you and Su Ruo could've happened.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.760
She washed your clothes,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.400
even helped you with homework.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.240
I always felt you two were a good match.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.200
You liked her so much,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.480
why didn't you tell her sooner?

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.920
Maybe...

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.880
I was just too timid back then.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I remember she was moving after graduation.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.120
You heard about it,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.600
and rushed over to see her one last time.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320
But you didn't see her.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.320
That does sound familiar.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.440
But I don't recall telling you.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.520
How did you know?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.960
You told me yourself that year.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.120
No, that's not right.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.920
Weren't you ignoring me back then?

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.560
Why would I talk to you?

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.200
We always got along, didn't we?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.920
Why would I ignore you?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.960
Isn't it because...

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.680
Like Hui Ge said,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.800
the Zhang Jie here

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.360
no longer has her original memories.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.960
She's Zhang Jie from a new parallel world.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.880
The memories she inherited

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.240
are of being rejected by me fifteen years ago

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.400
-not of being deceived by me. -Honestly, I expected this.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.000
After all, you liked Su Ruo.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.400
She never knew

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.080
I lost her letter.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.680
In this timeline,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.920
we've always been friends.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.080
I remembered wrong.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.040
It's all in the past.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.360
It's a new beginning.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.280
Fake sentimentality.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.640
So you mean, by traveling,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.160
from parallel world A to parallel world B,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.440
even if she's saved in world B,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.880
the one in the original world won't come back.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.400
Right.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.680
You can only save her in the new world.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.480
The one in the old world

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.360
will still die as she was meant to.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.200
The dead can't come back to life.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.800
Grandfather paradox, you know.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.880
Everything is a new beginning.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.600
But only you are gone.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.680
That never changes.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.640
Do you still remember Su Ruo?

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.640
Su Ruo? I remember.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.560
The pretty girl upstairs.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.920
Isn't this our class graduation photo?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.280
You still like Su Ruo, don't you?

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.600
Get out.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.040
I'm not taking your photo.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.840
Do you remember

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.720
you told me fifteen years ago someone bullied Su Ruo?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.800
Do you remember?

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.960
Yeah.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.240
Even if your novel's heroine

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.440
was bullied fifteen years ago,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.520
that doesn't mean

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.280
it's related to her death fifteen years later.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.720
Does this video remind you of anything?

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.440
Su Ruo.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.720
What's wrong?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.120
You're fine.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.640
I wasn't finished talking.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.600
Why are you closing the door?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.800
I...

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.160
I'll never see her again.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.960
Did you write any useful clues in this scene?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.400
Looks like just filler to me.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.760
Let's go over the useful clues again.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.760
Suppose—just suppose—

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.280
the Hoodie Man is telling the truth.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.760
Fifteen years ago in the novel,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.120
someone really bullied the heroine.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.240
And Hoodie Man saw that person recently.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.520
Could that person be the suspect?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.560
Who knows?

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.480
You need to lay out clues and evidence in the novel.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960
Plant some foreshadowing.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.600
If Hoodie Man refuses to tell the protagonist,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.960
how can the protagonist find that person?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.960
It's simple.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.520
You can create a prop

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.440
for the protagonist to find fifteen years later

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.840
and discover clues from fifteen years ago.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.960
What kind of prop?

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.920
You're the author.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.960
Think of it yourself.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.440
For example,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.920
a diary.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.920
That's a common trope.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.280
Su Ruo seemed to keep a diary.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.640
So I just need to find her diary, right?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.200
Thanks, Hui Ge. You're a genius.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.560
Getting this happy over a simple trope?

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.200
Your novel's quality seems questionable.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.360
Su Ruo's things are all over there.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.880
Okay, got it.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.720
You're not her boyfriend, are you?

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.000
No.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.520
Does she have a boyfriend?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.680
I really don't know.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.640
But she often stayed in her room

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.000
talking on the phone.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.560
Sounded like it was her boyfriend.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.520
Sometimes she sounded pretty angry.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840
Have you ever seen him?

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.680
No.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.000
Okay.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.840
Take all these things with you.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.480
New tenants are coming this afternoon.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.400
Her things here aren't auspicious.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.720
Does Su Ruo have any family at home?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.240
I've never seen her family visit.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.840
I shouldn't be in the mood to write a diary.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.280
But today, something happened

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.120
that left me completely at a loss.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.760
During the hardest moment,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.800
Yu Xingchen walked me home.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.080
I hate this feeling of total unfamiliarity.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.400
Is it just my imagination?

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.680
I remember, even when everyone teased him,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.520
he always kept his head down.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.200
But today, he kept looking at me.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.280
He didn't even blink.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.120
Like we were competing to see who'd look longer.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.120
I never expected

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.320
to see Yu Xingchen at my parents' funeral.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.600
Don't worry.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.960
I'm not going anywhere.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.960
I'll wait for you right here.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.640
He gave me a lot of encouragement.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.160
Honestly, I didn't expect

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.120
that the moment I saw him,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.880
my heart would suddenly feel at ease.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.280
It might sound a bit gossipy,

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.040
but I saw Yu Xingchen turn down Zhang Jie.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.000
Sorry.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.640
I didn't know before

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.360
he was someone who could be so decisive

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.360
when making decisions.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.040
It was a bit surprising.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.600
I'm starting to really dislike people who drink.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.480
They seem to become someone else after drinking.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.800
It's honestly scary.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.800
I remember I locked the door.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.840
How did he get in?

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.640
I'm really scared.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.240
I want to leave.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.000
Even if you really like someone in the future,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.080
you can't climb over the wall.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.520
It's a special time right now.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.720
She's in danger.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.160
Someone's bullying her.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.560
Hey, class leader.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.800
I have something to ask you.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.440
You said in Su Ruo's high school diary,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.400
she mentioned someone

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.480
who made her both scared and disgusted.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.200
In her diary, Su Ruo also wrote that after he drank,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.520
he opened her locked bedroom door.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.920
But all this happened fifteen years ago.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.880
Do you suspect Su Ruo's death is related to him?

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.840
Su Ruo's high school neighbor told me

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.560
the person who bullied Su Ruo in high school

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.880
showed up again before her accident.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.640
I'm just wondering if there's a connection.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.400
Back in high school...

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.360
Are you suspecting someone from our class?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.680
After Su Ruo graduated,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.280
did she keep in touch with anyone from our class?

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.240
After graduation,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.960
I never contacted Su Ruo again.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.600
But recently, on my social feed,

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.040
I saw someone mention Su Ruo.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.880
And this person also likes to drink.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.000
Who?

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.320
Zhang Xun.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.400
Zhang Xun.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.920
What did he post on his feed?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.040
After so many years apart,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.800
she's still curvy.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.280
Big boobs and a nice butt.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.520
What is this?

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.080
Who was our class beauty?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.800
Su Ruo.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.400
So Zhang Xun's post means

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.000
he saw Su Ruo not long ago.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.600
Look at the date on top.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.120
October.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.080
Shortly before Su Ruo's accident.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.160
Tang Song.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.320
I'm at Zhang Xun's place now.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.640
If you're free after work,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560
come over and hang out.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.760
A rare guest.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.840
I want this photo.
