00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:36.880
Verification successful.

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:39.319
How did you know Dad's safe combination?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.880
Dad told me about it before.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.000
Why didn't Dad tell me that?

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.240
Here, this is the company seal.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.520
These are the financial statements.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.560
We'll first screen them ourselves before
reconciling our accounts with the debtors.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.160
You know what to do. Screen them.

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:19.879
Meiqi,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.119
look.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.560
It turns out that Dad has done
his asset allocation long ago.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.719
He didn't want to implicate us.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.660
You answered seven questions incorrectly

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.679
on this page alone.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.320
Jiao, you're something else.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.439
I calculated them with my hand.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.279
You calculated them with a calculator.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:02:59.839
That's unfair.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.640
Try and use a calculator, then.

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:04.599
Try it if you dare.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.159
You see,

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.360
Mingzhu is so pitiful.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.559
First, her husband passed away.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.200
After that, her father-in-law
passed away as well.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.480
Why is my sister

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.559
so pitiful?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.439
Before this, we even told her to deliver
the cigarettes and liquor we bought to him.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.320
I wonder if she managed to deliver them.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.119
I don't think so.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.839
It was a sudden passing after all.

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:38.439
Yeah.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.040
Say, the cigarettes, especially the liquor,
they were of great quality.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.030
I didn't even taste it.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.640
Yeah. It was hard
to procure the liquor.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.240
Indeed.

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:51.360
Zhang Hao.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.399
What did you mean by that?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.920
Her father-in-law just passed away,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.920
yet you're only reminded of
the gifts we bought?

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.920
That's not it.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.279
Don't deny it. You said
you didn't get to drink it.

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:04.550
Don't think that I don't know
what you're thinking about.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.150
Zhang Hao, why aren't you
looking at the bigger picture?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.660
How could you do something like this?

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.240
That's not true!

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:17.320
Bigger picture?

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:18.760
What do you expect?

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.560
For me, the biggest picture is my family.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.399
I was just being honest.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.919
I didn't get to drink it.

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.039
Dad, what are you murmuring about?

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.640
Gratitude is essential!

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.000
Were you badmouthing me?

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.000
The company has less than

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.880
100,000 yuan in its bank account.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.839
But the outstanding payments
for raw materials

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:43.760
and transportation,

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.000
when added together,

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:48.239
are around two million yuan.

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:03.279
That's not all.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.320
What do you mean?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.080
Dad mortgaged the house
for two million yuan.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.320
Which house?

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.719
The house you guys were living in.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.479
When Dad transferred
the house ownership to me,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.520
he told me not to mortgage it
no matter how difficult it was.

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.560
Now, I finally understand what he meant.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.279
Mingzhu,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.680
be honest with me.

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.440
Did you realize that Dad was facing

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.919
a financial issue long ago?

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.440
It wasn't that long ago.

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:37.960
Before this, I helped Dad
to cover his meal expenses.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:40.120
When he wanted to reimburse me,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.840
I saw that he only had a few hundred
yuan left in his Alipay account.

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.320
Was that why you were in a hurry

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.760
to do a house ownership transfer?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.320
Indeed.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.599
Why didn't you tell us in advance?

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:51.760
How could I?

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:53.799
I wasn't sure about it either back then.

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.359
Mingzhu, I realize

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.039
that you're pretty crafty.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.960
Let's go once you're done packing.

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:10.760
Mom is still home alone.

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.399
What is this?

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:31.520
Oh yeah.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.919
This is the gold lock
I prepared for your baby.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.640
Why don't you take it with you?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.599
This is the gold lock
Dad had bought for my baby.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.850
He wanted to help my child put it on
during his one-month celebration.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.479
Let me keep it on my child's behalf.

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:52.320
What is this, then?

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.560
These are the gifts my sister told me to
deliver to him when she needed a favor.

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.479
I have to return them to her.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.310
Since Dad is no longer around,
you can take anything you like with you.

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:10.919
Hello?

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:12.760
My dear classmate.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.560
Can you hear me?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.279
I remember that your second uncle
was pretty resourceful.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:21.919
He knows everyone.

00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:24.880
He retired?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.680
How long has he been retired?

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:31.919
Five years? That's pretty recent.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320
He still has authority.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.479
Can you help me ask him whether...

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.279
I understand.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.440
Alright.

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:44.839
Okay.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.760
Let's keep in touch, then.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.760
Goodbye.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.520
I'm pregnant.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.359
I'm trying to find help for you,

00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:09.580
yet you're playing
video games on the sofa.

00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:11.560
Zhang Hao, it seems
you have a lot of free time.

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:14.680
You see, I was busy the entire day.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.860
I'm just trying to relax here.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.380
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:23.039
Dear, this is what I think.

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:23.680
You see,

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:25.839
it doesn't matter
if I become a HOD or not.

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:28.320
The most important thing is to live on.

00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:31.159
Just look at Mingzhu's husband.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.359
He was good-looking,
and he came from a wealthy family.

00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:36.280
But he passed away at such a young age.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.560
Look at Mingzhu's father-in-law.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.280
He was the most
resourceful person we know.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.800
He lived in a villa,
and drove a sports car.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.260
Even so, he passed away not long ago.

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:44.119
Don't you agree?

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.920
You do have a point.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.280
We have to learn from this lesson.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.599
Therefore, I need to find

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.400
a tall and handsome hunk

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.519
and have
a passionate relationship with him.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:05.920
Who knows when I might die?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.759
Where are you going?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.240
To find your ideal partner.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.920
Go and cook.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.519
She's only bent on
taking advantage of the situation.

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:42.400
Look.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.320
These are all the things
she took from Dad's office.

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:49.320
Mom.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.359
The cigarettes and liquor
were delivered by Zhixia to Dad

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.950
when she wanted to ask him for a favor.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.440
But they weren't delivered,
and the matter wasn't settled.

00:09:58.479 --> 00:10:00.479
Shouldn't we return them to her?

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.359
And, as for this gold lock,

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:07.839
Dad wanted to keep it for my child.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.359
You guys can have it first.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.839
We found this in Dad's safe.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.239
Take a look.

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:22.760
I think Dad prepared this audit report

00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:25.960
before everything went to hell.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.719
His goal was to separate

00:10:28.719 --> 00:10:30.639
his personal assets
from the company's assets

00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:32.350
so that we wouldn't be implicated.

00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:34.119
Legally speaking,

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:36.920
we don't need to repay the debt

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.280
Dad's company has incurred.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.119
That won't do.

00:10:44.719 --> 00:10:45.879
The law is the law.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.680
But business is business.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.359
Although that's the case,

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.479
we can't just do this.

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:55.280
We mustn't.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.639
Feng had always been fair and generous

00:11:01.999 --> 00:11:03.280
his entire life.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.599
He was honest and upright.

00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:07.560
As his family,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.239
we mustn't allow the debt

00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:10.960
to ruin his reputation.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.320
We mustn't.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.200
We have to repay his debt even if it means
we have to sell everything.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.400
We have to repay his debt.

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:21.359
As for this...

00:11:26.599 --> 00:11:28.040
Just take it as if it doesn't exist.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.960
Mingzhu,

00:11:32.599 --> 00:11:33.479
do you agree?

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:36.759
I shall follow your will.

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:38.920
Meiqi, what about you?

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.320
Mom, I understand.

00:11:43.599 --> 00:11:44.200
Okay.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.440
You guys are great children.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.119
Thank you so much.

00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:55.400
Dispose of his car
and the other company vehicles.

00:11:56.359 --> 00:11:57.719
Sell everything

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.280
that can be sold.

00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:02.680
Go and tally up

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:04.560
exactly how much money he owes.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:06.320
Tell me after that.

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:32.960
Mom.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:38.160
Mingzhu is in trouble again.

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:42.800
Please bless her from above.

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:46.680
No matter if she recognizes me
as her mom or not,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.920
I hope that my second daughter

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.479
can lead a safe and smooth-sailing life.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.320
Zhixia, you're here.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.879
Dale sent us
another batch of foundation

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:09.080
for us to help promote.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.440
Looks like they cashed in
on the lipstick boom last time.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.160
How is it?

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.960
Take a look.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.160
It's pretty smooth.
It goes on effortlessly.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.200
Let me help you.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.479
Zhixia,

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.960
I used up my foundation.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.200
Can I take a bottle?

00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:37.080
Go ahead.

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:38.800
Why are you being so generous?

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.320
The suppliers sent them to us.
It's not like you're spending my money.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.560
Take it as an employee benefit.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.920
Don't demand a raise from me
at the end of the year, okay?

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.560
Now, all industries
are super competitive.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.200
Don't envy other people.

00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:52.999
You should stay down-to-earth

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.200
and cherish what you have now.

00:13:55.479 --> 00:13:57.359
I only intend to take
a bottle of foundation,

00:13:57.359 --> 00:13:59.280
and now, I have
to listen to your lecture.

00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:01.320
I'm not giving you a lecture here.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.960
I'm explaining
the market conditions to you.

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:08.239
You see, my husband
is running for a position.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.920
It's just for the position
of a lowly HOD.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.400
Even so, everyone's
fighting tooth and nail for it.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.960
It's terrible.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.239
Maodou.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.160
Is any of your relatives

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.280
working in the Personnel Bureau?

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.580
Can you tell them to give a shout-out
to Dianlan Group for us?

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:27.239
Zhixia.

00:14:28.719 --> 00:14:32.479
Why did you think I'd be working here
if any of my relatives

00:14:32.479 --> 00:14:33.879
was working in the Personnel Bureau?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.200
Therefore, for common folks like us,

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:42.280
it's better for us to work diligently

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.800
instead of daydreaming about
getting rich quickly.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.400
Let's make some money!

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.599
How?

00:14:49.719 --> 00:14:51.479
I plan to start a video channel.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.200
Although your articles aren't great,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.400
you're quite likable.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.719
And, you're eloquent as well.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.160
Why don't you
be in charge of this project?

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:02.920
Zhixia.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.150
Will I get paid for this?

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.280
How could you be this materialistic?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.040
Money is the only thing on your mind.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.719
You have to do it first.

00:15:11.719 --> 00:15:12.519
When it works out,

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:15.160
I'll give you
the commission you deserve.

00:15:17.119 --> 00:15:17.879
Think about it.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.400
By then,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.080
you won't just be
a normal employee under me.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.359
You'll be the company's COO,

00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:26.479
the Chief Operations Officer.

00:15:26.479 --> 00:15:27.839
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah.

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.160
Now that our official account

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.410
has built up quite a following,

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:33.119
you should strike while the iron is hot.

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:34.320
I expect great things from you.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.160
What's wrong?

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.920
Why is our official account banned?

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.239
Sit here.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.560
Is your spouse coming?

00:15:54.839 --> 00:15:55.639
Nope.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.599
She isn't?

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.800
What's with all the food, then?

00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.400
That's right.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.040
What's wrong with it?

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.920
Zhixia is the one who's pregnant here.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.700
Why do you have
an increased appetite instead?

00:16:05.719 --> 00:16:06.759
It's because I'm tired.

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:07.239
You're tired?

00:16:07.239 --> 00:16:08.320
I have to serve her.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.519
Yeah. You're quite optimistic,
aren't you?

00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:14.400
By the way, regarding the competitive
selection next Wednesday,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.410
I assume you know by now.

00:16:17.239 --> 00:16:17.999
I don't.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.479
I thought you already sought help.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.660
Didn't he tell you about it?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.999
He's been too busy lately.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.639
I suppose your help was unreliable.

00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:28.440
Buddy, listen.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.550
Go back and prepare for everything.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.550
This time, all of the top executives
will be participating in the evaluation.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.119
Is it that serious?

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.390
No matter if you're selected or not,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.200
it's a good thing for you
to leave a good impression

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.710
on all of the top guys in the company.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.560
Don't you agree?

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.719
Hey, it's like you know everything.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.119
That's a secret.

00:16:52.119 --> 00:16:52.839
I'm done.

00:16:58.239 --> 00:16:58.800
Come here.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:16:59.960
Come here.

00:17:03.359 --> 00:17:04.319
Say,

00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:06.759
why did you tell me about it?

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.770
If none of us were prepared,

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.110
if you were the only one
who was prepared,

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.950
you would stand out
from the crowd, wouldn't you?

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:19.200
Buddy, let me put it this way.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.999
The fiercer the competition is,

00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:23.960
the more it proves the winner's skills,

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:24.999
don't you agree?

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.239
Just be prepared.

00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:29.600
See you.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.920
Why was he trying to put on airs?

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.780
"The more it proves
the winner's skills"?

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:41.600
My foot.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.079
Hello?

00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:45.479
I'm the person
in charge of Zhixia Speaks.

00:17:45.479 --> 00:17:46.479
I want to ask you

00:17:46.479 --> 00:17:48.239
why our official account was banned.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.400
We didn't break any of the rules.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.440
What?

00:17:55.999 --> 00:17:57.840
Our content is
suspected of being indecent?

00:17:58.079 --> 00:17:59.840
That's impossible.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.239
It's a decent program.

00:18:01.239 --> 00:18:01.719
I...

00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:07.319
Excuse me.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.239
How can I remove the ban, then?

00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:12.160
Submit an appeal?

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.200
Okay.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.079
Got it. Thank you.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.360
Why was our content
suspected of being indecent?

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.640
Don't tell me it's because of this.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.440
I told you to put a picture.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.390
How dare you put someone naked?

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.799
She's not naked!

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:39.120
Of course we have to wear a bikini
when we're at the beach!

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.719
Don't try to argue your way out of this.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.719
You knew such pictures were most likely to
be maliciously reported by our competitors.

00:18:43.719 --> 00:18:44.680
Even so, you still used it.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.840
Just look at her butt.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.479
What should we do, then?

00:18:47.999 --> 00:18:49.600
Hurry and submit an appeal.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.719
This is infuriating.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.600
You're something else.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:55.910
You cannot complete any tasks,
you're a glutton,

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.640
you cause trouble all the time,

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.450
and you go out of your way
to make things worse.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.559
Dad,

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.400
are you a HOD now?

00:19:07.999 --> 00:19:08.719
Not yet.

00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:11.319
I think there's no point in being one.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.950
I can't watch TV with you again
if I become a HOD.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:14.999
Yeah.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.880
It's better for you
to remain as my dad.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.479
Of course.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.479
That smells.

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.440
Smell it yourself.

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:23.920
It's oily!

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.680
Okay. I'll get to it as soon as possible.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.239
We're submitting an appeal now.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.400
It'll take several days.

00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:34.999
Don't worry.

00:19:35.719 --> 00:19:37.079
We'll withdraw all of the lawsuits.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.120
Okay. Goodbye.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.360
"A Complaint Free World",

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.999
a winner for 21 days.

00:19:45.479 --> 00:19:46.600
Mom, you're back.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.960
I've been reading since just now.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:48.999
Good girl.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.200
It's a type of tool

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.319
that connects all networks.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.440
Why did you return so early today?

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.999
Our official account was banned.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.660
We have to stop our operation for now.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.960
We've already submitted an appeal.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.250
Your official account was banned?

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.319
What kind of evil deeds
have you guys committed?

00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:05.319
Stop bringing it up.
It makes my head hurt.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.200
Butler Zhang is ready to serve.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:10.920
Butler Zhang Jr. is ready to serve too.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.360
Zhang, have you finished your homework?

00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:16.560
According to the group chat,
you failed your essay-writing task.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.920
If so, I'll do my corrections now.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:19.360
Don't skive, okay?

00:20:21.999 --> 00:20:23.719
The appeal will take
at least seven days.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.559
What should we do about the ads?

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.479
Lady, is this strength okay for you?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.279
Why do I smell spicy strips?

00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:32.680
I think so.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.799
Did you guys eat it
without my permission?

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:34.950
Where did the smell come from?

00:20:46.479 --> 00:20:47.960
Who bought this?

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.559
Zhang Hao.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.400
Did you eat this again?

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.880
Did you feed Jiao with it?

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.719
Did you?

00:20:54.999 --> 00:20:55.840
Jiao.

00:20:56.239 --> 00:20:57.559
How many times have I told you?

00:20:57.559 --> 00:21:00.079
Children like you
shouldn't eat spicy strips.

00:21:00.079 --> 00:21:02.600
They're filled with
all kinds of preservatives.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.400
What did they eat?

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.200
Zhixia, you're pregnant.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.200
How could you eat such snacks?

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.400
They're filled with preservatives.

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:14.640
Who bought this?

00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:16.799
It's not me. Zhang Hao bought it.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.960
My colleague gave it to me.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.759
He gave me it to me during work.

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:29.920
I can't just reject him

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.880
and throw it away.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.360
Mom, I'm sure he bought it.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.479
That's not true.
I'll throw it away right now.

00:21:34.479 --> 00:21:35.200
Is she speaking the truth?

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:35.719
No. Just throw it away.

00:21:35.719 --> 00:21:36.840
Why are you throwing it away?

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.239
Dad bought that for me.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.600
I haven't finished it yet.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.200
Jiao.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.759
Jiao, you mustn't eat that.

00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:44.880
Hurry and throw it away.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.360
I'll buy you some chocolates.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.840
Chocolates are bad too.
They're unhealthy.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.479
It's sweet.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.960
It'll cause cavities.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.360
They may also trigger
childhood diabetes, you know?

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.759
Mom said this before.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.719
All products sold in the store

00:21:59.719 --> 00:22:01.279
have undergone quality inspections.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.559
They meet the required standards.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.360
Even so, they might not be healthy.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.759
These are two different matters.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.759
Yeah.

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:10.759
Granny is saying that for your own good.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.630
If so, I suppose
Granny told you to be a HOD

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.079
was for your own good as well.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.279
Why did you tell me
that it was pointless to be a HOD, then?

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.430
- Did you say that?
- Did you actually say that?

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.239
I was just joking.

00:22:22.239 --> 00:22:24.880
No. You meant it just now.

00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:26.400
Zhang Hao,

00:22:26.759 --> 00:22:28.279
I need to talk to you.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.079
Forget about it.

00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:33.920
Don't make
our home atmosphere so tensed up,

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.640
okay?

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:35.999
Mom.

00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:38.120
My younger sister is here.

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:39.680
I need to go downstairs.

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:40.999
You can chat with him.

00:22:40.999 --> 00:22:42.080
Do you need me to join you?

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:52.680
Her family sure has a lot going on.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.479
Sit down.

00:22:55.479 --> 00:22:56.960
Come, let's talk.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.479
How did you educate your child?

00:23:05.479 --> 00:23:07.200
How could you let her eat such junk?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.400
Are you even educating her?

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.360
Mom, I know my fault now.

00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:13.799
Mom...

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.999
That hurts!

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.640
Mom, don't be angry.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.319
That hurts!

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.150
What are you laughing at?

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.250
How dare you laugh? You haven't
paid for your ticket yet.

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:33.719
Mingzhu.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.160
Zhixia.

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:39.680
What brings you here?

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:41.660
I didn't manage to deliver

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.559
your cigarettes and liquor
to my father-in-law.

00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:44.880
I came here to return them.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.279
Just look at you.

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:48.430
You're pregnant,
yet you're traveling here and there.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.920
This isn't urgent at all.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.640
It is.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.960
Find someone else to help your husband.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.519
Don't let this delay his promotion.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.880
When my husband heard
that your father-in-law had passed away,

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.920
he gave up immediately.

00:24:00.719 --> 00:24:01.680
All men are like that.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.079
You have to encourage him more.

00:24:03.079 --> 00:24:04.960
He wants to lie flat,
while I want him to succeed.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.360
We argue whenever I encourage him.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.200
Enough. Let's drop the topic.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.319
Come and join me for dinner.

00:24:10.319 --> 00:24:11.350
My mother-in-law brought
plenty of dishes with her.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.079
No thanks.
I'm still in my mourning period.

00:24:13.079 --> 00:24:14.160
It's inappropriate for me
to visit anyone.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.239
It's fine.
You shouldn't be that particular.

00:24:16.239 --> 00:24:16.640
Come on.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.440
No thanks.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.400
I have something to do later.
See you next time.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400
You should return now.

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:22.799
Take care, then.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.060
Did they actually have no idea that
their family gave her younger sister away?

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.200
Of course not.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.750
What do you think
will happen if they know?

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:37.079
In her final moments, Granny
held her hand tightly and confessed

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.400
that the family had once
given away a baby sister.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.039
How did you think
my parents-in-law reacted?

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:45.200
They were so furious
that they almost lost their minds.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.640
They were bent on finding her.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.559
Now, they've found her.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.960
But the girl is kind of pitiful.

00:24:50.319 --> 00:24:51.319
Her foster parents

00:24:51.319 --> 00:24:52.880
treated her nicely.

00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:54.479
She was going to get married.

00:24:54.479 --> 00:24:55.840
And, she found a good husband too.

00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:57.840
Her husband and his family were perfect.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:59.519
And, they were pretty well-off too.

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:01.400
But you see,

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:02.960
her mother-in-law

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.640
was just like you. Both of you are mean.

00:25:06.239 --> 00:25:07.360
What a great example.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.350
Did you say that I'm mean?

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.640
It was just a joke.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.850
But she did find herself
a great husband.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.039
Not only was he the family's
breadwinner, but he also did chores.

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:16.479
He was good in all aspects.

00:25:16.479 --> 00:25:17.759
And, he loved her deeply.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.200
They were so loving.

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:20.160
I'm serious.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.880
But it didn't last long.

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:23.759
He was so kind.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.950
He jumped into the water
to save a drowning child.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.840
The child survived,
but he didn't survive.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.160
It was so tragic.

00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:32.360
Not only that,

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.200
the person I was asking a favor from,

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.719
who was her father-in-law,

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.440
he passed away as well.

00:25:39.719 --> 00:25:40.319
What a tragedy.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.479
Her sister does have it rough.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.440
Yeah.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.479
Her wedding didn't go through,

00:25:46.479 --> 00:25:48.759
but their funerals came in pairs.

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:50.640
See? You're being mean again.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.519
What do you mean by "came in pairs"?

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:53.840
Zhang Hao,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.640
People must dare to venture,
just like horses must be set free.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.960
It's time for you to shoulder
the responsibility of this family.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.719
You know?

00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:00.880
Just look at Zhixia.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.239
Her family already has a lot going on.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.759
Let's just talk about the gift money.

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:08.360
We're only giving it out.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.440
When can we recover our capital?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.680
The money is nowhere to be seen.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.360
The gift money
is the only thing you think about.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.519
Do you want the gift money that much?

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:14.950
When we give birth to our second child,

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.160
when we hold a celebration for him,

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:18.719
we'll be able to recover our money.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.239
We only receive a little,

00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:23.559
yet we give out so much.

00:26:25.319 --> 00:26:26.519
I've always suspected

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.440
that you have a family ledger with you.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.920
Can you just show it to me?

00:26:30.039 --> 00:26:31.200
I don't need a ledger.

00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:33.440
My mind is a ledger.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.279
It always felt to me
that you should be a Scorpio.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.640
You're back.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.640
Yeah.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.239
Why did you come back alone?

00:26:49.239 --> 00:26:50.360
Didn't you invite
Mingzhu here for dinner?

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.920
She was sensible. She knew
that it was inappropriate to come.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.999
Are these gifts from them?

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.759
No. Before this, we asked
her father-in-law for a favor.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.039
Now, he has passed away.

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.079
You missed these gifts, didn't you?

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.510
Mingzhu delivered them
back to us for your sake.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.719
You said you didn't get
to try the liquor, right?

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:20.319
Open it, then.

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:22.519
Drink up.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.719
Drink until you drop.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.999
How dare you badmouth me behind my back?

00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:36.960
She heard us, didn't she?

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.719
What do you think?

00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:42.400
Store them for me.

00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:44.600
How should I know where to store them?

00:27:44.999 --> 00:27:46.600
Just store them anywhere you want.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:49.999
Hurry. If not, she'll tell me off again.

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:51.880
I'm scared of her.

00:27:52.999 --> 00:27:54.799
Can we keep these in the refrigerator?

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.239
How can you keep baijiu
in the refrigerator?

00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:57.759
Just leave them by the wall.

00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:58.479
Don't let her see them.

00:27:58.479 --> 00:27:59.770
If not, she'll tell me off again.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.060
Here are the cigarettes.

00:28:03.479 --> 00:28:03.999
Look.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.200
I'm a complete mess now.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.239
What should I do now?

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.559
Where should I store the cigarettes?

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:10.719
Anywhere you like.

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:30.239
When I was young,
I often played in the factory.

00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:32.479
Dad hired someone

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.840
to build this pond for us just because

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.319
Jianqi and me wanted
to rear some goldfish.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.239
Dad was truly nice to you two.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.920
Dad was the best father in the world.

00:28:45.239 --> 00:28:47.479
Jianqi was
the best brother in the world too.

00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:54.610
It's a shame that both of them are gone.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.039
And, we're losing the factory too.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.239
Are they here?

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:08.680
Guys,

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.920
both of them are here.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.270
- They're here?
- We're here.

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:14.279
Look at the date!

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.559
- Do you know what date it is?
- Hurry!

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:16.740
Do you know how many days it has been?

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:17.680
Misters and madams.

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.400
It's truly difficult to meet you guys.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.279
Yeah, Feng.

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:21.510
We've been waiting for so long.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.680
You should give us an account.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.760
You didn't answer our calls!

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.319
We won't show you mercy
if we don't resolve this today!

00:29:27.319 --> 00:29:29.279
I won't let you off
until you give us an account!

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:30.920
Listen to us first.

00:29:30.999 --> 00:29:32.239
Listen to us first.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.120
Misters and madams,

00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:37.039
I know

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.400
some of you.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.319
And, I don't know some of you.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.559
But you guys

00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:45.759
were my dad's friends
for several decades.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.200
You guys even
watched over me and my brother

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.479
as we grew up.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.680
It's really painful for us
to meet like this today.

00:29:56.719 --> 00:29:58.239
I'm so sorry.

00:29:58.719 --> 00:30:00.479
It's pointless to apologize.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.759
Don't start that with me!

00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:02.479
We have no choice either.

00:30:02.479 --> 00:30:03.319
Now,

00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:06.200
I'll give you all the straight facts.

00:30:07.519 --> 00:30:08.319
This file contains

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.079
all the funds
in our company's accounts and

00:30:11.079 --> 00:30:12.519
the list of fixed assets.

00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:15.519
The company is now insolvent.

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:17.440
- What?
- It's insolvent?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.200
What do you mean?

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.519
What do you mean?
Are you trying to play dirty here?

00:30:19.519 --> 00:30:21.200
A huge factory like this
is actually insolvent?

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.239
Did you guys tamper with the accounts?

00:30:22.239 --> 00:30:23.400
Don't try to trick us!

00:30:23.479 --> 00:30:24.799
Is there no cash in the safe?

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:27.039
All factories have an emergency fund!

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:28.319
That's right!

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:29.400
And, your dad's funeral

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.039
was even held at Lijun Hotel.

00:30:31.039 --> 00:30:32.460
Now that we're asking you for money,

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.600
you're saying that it's insolvent?

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.840
What kind of tricks
are you guys trying to pull here?

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.319
Back then, we put up real money

00:30:36.319 --> 00:30:37.519
to cover Feng's expenses.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.400
He was able to drive a sports car
and live in a villa.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.390
And, he even sent you
to England for your studies.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.600
Now, Feng is gone.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.160
On account of our ties, we waited until

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.960
after the seventh day of his passing
before we would bring it up.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.519
But now? You guys...

00:30:47.519 --> 00:30:49.479
You guys have no respect for us at all!

00:30:49.479 --> 00:30:51.120
Yeah. You're just trying to...

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.260
Now, you're doing this to me?

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.200
- What do you mean by that?
- In my opinion,

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.239
you guys are just buying time here.

00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:56.400
For what purpose?

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.320
For them to transfer
all of his assets to them!

00:30:58.519 --> 00:30:59.239
You have a point!

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.039
Look!

00:31:00.039 --> 00:31:00.660
That's not true.

00:31:00.999 --> 00:31:02.680
Misters and madam,

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.039
please listen to us first, okay?

00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:06.239
Fine.

00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:07.360
Go ahead.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.239
I've always been thankful to you guys
for trusting my father-in-law,

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.719
working together with him,
and covering his expenses.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.640
But now,
the company has gone out of business.

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:17.799
My father-in-law has let you all down.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.560
Let me apologize to you all

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.559
on his behalf first.

00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:23.440
What's the point of apologizing?

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.120
Let's talk about something practical.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.799
Let's not argue for now.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.120
They invited us here

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.519
to resolve the issue.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.719
Let's wait for them
to finish their words first, okay?

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.880
Hurry up.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.120
I'll see what you can tell me.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.239
Hurry up.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.120
We only found out about

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.680
the company's situation not long ago.

00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:44.440
We weren't prepared for it at all.

00:31:44.719 --> 00:31:46.960
There's no money in
the company's bank account.

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:50.239
However, we will work with the bank
and the company's finance department

00:31:50.239 --> 00:31:52.239
to develop a repayment plan for everyone.

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:54.160
Please don't worry.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.479
We may go bankrupt
or beg for food on the streets,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.200
but we would never default on our debt.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.319
My dada cared about his reputation.

00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:05.440
Although he's gone,

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.640
I, Feng Meiqi,

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.239
won't let anything

00:32:08.239 --> 00:32:09.239
harm his reputation.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.160
Let's forget about that for now.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.519
It's not about his reputation here.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.999
Misters and madams,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.559
I understand your feelings completely.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.600
(Audit Report of Nanzhou Jianmei Workshop)
If we look at this audit report,

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.519
legally speaking,

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:24.479
we may choose not to repay the debt.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.999
But we invited all of you here

00:32:26.999 --> 00:32:28.519
in order to show you our determination.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.120
We'll definitely repay the debt.

00:32:31.559 --> 00:32:33.160
But please give us some time,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:33.680
okay?

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.200
We've been paying for it
for a long time.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.600
We have to survive too.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:37.719
Things are difficult for us too.

00:32:37.719 --> 00:32:39.200
Come, dear debtors.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.279
Fellow debtors, listen to me.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.280
We live in a society
governed by the rule of law.

00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:45.160
Don't you think this farce is pointless?

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.600
It doesn't resolve the issue at all.

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:51.640
Just now, Feng's daughter
and daughter-in-law

00:32:51.999 --> 00:32:53.510
have already explained the situation.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.479
Don't you guys know who Feng is?

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.260
We've been doing business
with him for several decades.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.600
He was serious and particular.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.759
I think his daughter and daughter-in-law

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.799
handle things much more skillfully.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.559
Today,

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.960
I'll express my stand.

00:33:10.759 --> 00:33:13.279
I choose to trust them

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.799
and the Feng family.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.650
I'll wait for their repayment.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:18.960
Wang!

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:20.160
Wang, what do you mean by that?

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.200
What was that?

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.600
Hey.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.120
We'll come up with a solution.

00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:24.559
Please give us some time.

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:26.160
Fine. I'll trust you guys as well.

00:33:26.239 --> 00:33:27.479
But please hurry up.

00:33:27.479 --> 00:33:28.160
I've been waiting the whole week!

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.279
Me too!

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.160
Stop delaying it!

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:30.999
Fine. I'll trust you one last time.

00:33:30.999 --> 00:33:32.559
I'll trust you guys one last time.

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:33.360
This is the last time.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:33.960
Let's go.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.960
You'd better hurry up.

00:33:35.799 --> 00:33:36.600
Stop crying.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.319
I'll trust you guys.

00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:38.160
We expect good news from you.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:38.920
- Wang!
- Okay.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.920
Let's go.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.840
We'll get through this eventually.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.479
Thank you, Mingzhu.

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:00.680
Mr. Zhang, I'm truly sorry.

Can you hold off on
releasing that ad for a few more days?

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.440
What about this?

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.999
I'll write three more articles for you.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:12.199
They're free.

Today is our store anniversary.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.960
The ads will be pointless
if we delay it now.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.679
Forget it. Let's terminate the contract.

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:19.770
I won't pursue
any legal responsibilities.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:20.960
Okay.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.440
Thank you for your understanding.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.800
I will refund
the full payment to you, then.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.479
Goodbye.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:27.920
I'm truly sorry about this.

Mrs. Zhang,

00:34:39.733 --> 00:34:41.280
the piano lessons need to be renewed.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.420
The total is 22,000 yuan.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.140
(Superior)

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.559
My superior is calling me.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.800
Shouldn't you go somewhere else?

00:34:59.519 --> 00:35:00.679
Go ahead.

00:35:03.159 --> 00:35:03.800
Yes, ma'am.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.079
What's your order?

00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:07.199
The piano lessons need to be renewed.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.920
What? Again?

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.679
Didn't I just pay for it not long ago?

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:12.599
Buddy,

00:35:12.999 --> 00:35:14.920
time flies, you know?

00:35:15.159 --> 00:35:16.639
It's already been a year since then.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.639
I heard this about

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.320
the son of Li De, my colleague.

00:35:24.119 --> 00:35:25.320
He merely took online lessons.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.720
Even so, he passed Grade 10.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.320
Hey, some people
don't even need lessons.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.720
Some of them can't even read scores.

00:35:30.999 --> 00:35:31.679
Zhang Hao,

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.159
can we set higher standards
for ourselves?

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.760
Piano is the king of all instruments.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:37.920
If we want our child to learn piano,
we should be serious.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.559
We have to see it through.

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:41.479
I know that.

00:35:41.479 --> 00:35:43.060
It's not like I'm canceling the lesson.

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:47.479
Isn't my payroll card with you?

00:35:47.479 --> 00:35:49.039
Isn't your bonus card with you?

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.790
Zhang Hao, don't tell me you suck so much
that you're not getting a bonus this year.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.999
That's impossible.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.720
I'm not that terrible at my job.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.559
Hey, about your selection...

00:35:58.559 --> 00:35:59.320
Coming!

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.679
They're calling me to work.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.240
I'm busy. Talk to you later.

00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:09.440
He's a man, yet he can't afford
to raise a single child.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.199
And, how dare he...

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.360
Mom.

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:27.479
Did you change the password at the door?

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.150
Were you trying to prevent me
from coming in?

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.550
Luckily, I didn't forget my keys.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.320
Granny.

00:36:32.039 --> 00:36:32.840
Come.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.920
I brought some meat buns
from the company's canteen.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.960
They're very delicious.

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:38.079
I love those meat buns.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.519
Are you in trouble?

00:36:42.519 --> 00:36:44.240
Don't beat around the bush.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.159
Get straight to the point.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.039
I lack money.

00:36:50.559 --> 00:36:52.280
We need to renew Jiao's piano lessons.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.840
And, Zhixia's official account
is still banned.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.079
She's very anxious.

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:57.440
She wants me to pay half of it.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.240
I'm a little...

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.320
What? You can't even afford that?

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.240
Why would I come here with meat buns
if I could afford it in the first place?

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.039
So, you came here
with an ulterior motive,

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.999
thinking that I would help you out?

00:37:07.479 --> 00:37:08.240
Correct.

00:37:08.999 --> 00:37:11.440
It's a shame that Mom isn't a cop
when she's this observant.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.880
She's good at discovering issues.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.039
We can pay for it.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.840
We save up money

00:37:17.079 --> 00:37:18.559
for Jiao's sake anyway.

00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:19.840
Am I right?

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.660
How much do you need?

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.599
Transfer 10,000 yuan to me.

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:26.519
I mean, 11,000 yuan.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.679
Don't worry.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.850
I'll return the money to you
right after I receive my bonus.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.280
With that measly bonus of yours? Geez.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.720
What did you say? Granny, look at Mom.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.920
Of all the things to say.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.880
Enough. Transfer extra money to him.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.920
Youngsters like them
have plenty of expenses.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.480
And, they're under huge pressure too.

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:44.250
Zhang Hao, let me ask you this.

00:37:44.479 --> 00:37:47.599
Zhixia wouldn't use the money you
transfer to her to support her family, right?

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:48.720
How could that be?

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.920
This money

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.960
is only meant for Jiao.

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:53.079
It's only meant for her.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.519
Transfer it.

00:37:55.999 --> 00:37:56.599
Fine.

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:02.400
Did you receive it?

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:06.280
Yeah.

00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:09.199
Look. It's only meant for
Jiao's piano lessons.

00:38:09.519 --> 00:38:11.240
Mom is particular indeed.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.880
Thank you, Mom.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.599
Have some meat buns.

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:16.519
- Come on.
- They're delicious.

00:38:16.519 --> 00:38:18.079
No way. They're so expensive.

00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:21.999
Yeah. You should eat up.

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:22.960
These meat buns cost over 10,000 yuan.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.479
Yeah.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.850
I'll have some tangerines.
You can have these.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.479
Mister.

00:38:29.999 --> 00:38:30.519
Hello.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.720
What's the gold price for today?

00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:37.840
It has risen a bit.

00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:38.950
The rate is pretty good.

00:38:41.039 --> 00:38:41.960
What do you need?

00:38:44.479 --> 00:38:46.320
I wish to sell these two gold bars.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.340
You wish to sell them?

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:51.800
Okay.

00:38:52.599 --> 00:38:53.800
Let me weigh them first.

00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:54.559
Okay.

00:39:01.199 --> 00:39:02.199
Please take a look.

00:39:02.199 --> 00:39:03.519
It's precisely 40 gram.

00:39:03.519 --> 00:39:04.639
Please wait here.

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:06.039
I'll go and test them first.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.360
(The company is insolvent.)

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.999
(Their house has been mortgaged.)

00:39:19.639 --> 00:39:21.800
(The monthly interest
already amounts to 10,000 yuan.)

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.070
(And, it has been
overdue for two months.)

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:27.280
(By selling these gold bars,
I can settle the interest for now.)

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.400
(But what about next month
or the month after that?)

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.679
All done.

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:32.880
There's no problem.

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:33.679
Okay.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.639
Should I transfer the money
to your Alipay account?

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:36.639
Or your WeChat account?

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.400
Please transfer it to this card.

Mom.

00:40:33.079 --> 00:40:33.639
Here.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.079
I made you chicken soup with noodles.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.940
I've rinsed
the preserved vegetables in water.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.550
I've mixed it with
some sesame oil as well.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.880
It's no longer salty.

00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:42.479
I'm not hungry.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.760
Just take a bite.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:46.960
Okay.

00:40:58.599 --> 00:40:59.240
Mingzhu.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.079
Regarding the debt
Jianqi's dad has incurred,

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.999
how do you guys intend to deal with it?

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.760
We'll deal with it as we're supposed to.

00:41:09.559 --> 00:41:11.119
We have already clarified our assets

00:41:11.199 --> 00:41:13.060
and are reconciling accounts
with our debtors.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.559
Mingzhu, I think
you should let Jianqi's sister

00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:18.720
handle these affairs.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.599
Look at you.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.360
You're still pregnant.

00:41:22.599 --> 00:41:24.079
You shouldn't be stressed out.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.760
You shouldn't get involved in this mess.

00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:27.880
I have to.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.800
He already transferred
the house ownership to me.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.720
I can't just go into hiding

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.800
when they're in trouble.

00:41:34.039 --> 00:41:34.639
Am I right?

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:38.559
It's fine. I can do this.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.999
Eat slowly.

00:41:44.679 --> 00:41:46.999
Why don't you spend the night here?

00:41:46.999 --> 00:41:48.800
I have to go back tonight.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.880
Alright.
I'll ask Minghui to send you home.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:51.880
Okay.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.479
Yeah.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.320
Eat slowly. There's no rush.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.079
Minghui.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.639
What's the matter, Mingzhu?

00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:03.800
Don't you think
my life has been pretty tough?

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.800
I lost my husband,

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.680
and I've lost all of our wealth too.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.559
Mingzhu, the wealth is still there.

00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:11.920
It's just that it's negative now.

00:42:13.519 --> 00:42:14.320
Isn't my life bitter?

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.320
Isn't your life bitter?

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:18.950
Is anything more bitter than
being in the fifth year of high school?

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.360
Mingzhu, open your mouth.

00:42:29.639 --> 00:42:30.800
It's not as bitter now, right?

00:42:34.159 --> 00:42:34.760
It's sweet.

00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:36.880
No matter what happens,

00:42:37.479 --> 00:42:39.679
