00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.240
This kind of doll is a Siakaban doll.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.920
Only a shaman’s house would have it.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.680
Or a medium’s shrine.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.880
Thup, it’s me.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.840
Then can you explain it?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.840
Why this victim buried the doll in the garden?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.120
I think was hit with witchcraft.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.720
You don’t know Singha?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.200
He once caused a death from framing like this.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.720
Ghost, come out now.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.360
Someone’s testing it.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.560
- Jump
- Stop

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.960
Thup, Thup.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.920
Thup.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.080
Thup.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.760
Don’t be scared.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.000
I’m right here.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.840
It’s fine, it’s fine.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.080
It’s fine.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.200
Easy, easy.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.480
Easy.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.360
Uh, Inspector.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.000
I’ll take these kids to the station first.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.520
Uh,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.760
Yeah, okay. I’ll follow.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.200
Come on, move. You kids.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.640
Easy, easy, Thup.

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.480
You okay?

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.800
P'Singha.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.000
I saw a ghost again.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.720
I know.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.120
But I’m here now.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.920
No one…

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.039
no ghost can hurt you now.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.320
Inspector.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.759
He should be fine now.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.440
Thup just got scared.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.360
So I calmed him down.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.320
Oh, okay.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.479
I mean it.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.760
I didn’t say anything.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.920
Take his phone too.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.639
- Yes.
- Get it checked.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.800
Yes, sir.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.080
You really okay?

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.640
I’m okay.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.840
Then go.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.720
Go.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.960
So what did you see just now?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.840
You looked more scared than usual.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.120
Here.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.440
Thup.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.480
You took this from the scene?

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.120
Uh, I saw it on the ground.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.160
I didn’t know who dropped it.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.240
Maybe it belonged to those YouTubers.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.920
I didn’t dare hand it to you. They were live.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.320
Didn’t want people panicking more.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.840
But you shouldn’t pick it up bare-handed.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.520
I really didn’t think.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.920
I think…

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.760
the ghost got mad I found the Siakaban doll.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.360
Because normal wandering spirits

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.560
don’t hurt people.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.320
They want merit offerings.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.480
But this one…

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.600
feels like it came to harm someone.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.240
What do you mean?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.440
I don’t get it.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.360
I think…

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.120
the ghost was following an order.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.440
An order?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.880
You saying someone can control a ghost?

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.120
Yes.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.320
Like I told you before.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.079
Anyone with these dolls might be hit with witchcraft.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.680
And the one controlling the ghost…

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.920
has to be a dark shaman.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.880
Witchcraft, ghosts…

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.640
and now a shaman who can command one?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.040
People who keep ghosts to use won’t stop.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.000
From my time as a temple kid,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.720
and everything I’ve lived through,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.320
I can guarantee you this:

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.640
they won’t stop.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.320
Then I need to know.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.560
Who that damn shaman is.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.120
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.040
Whoa.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.200
What are you doing, Thup?

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.600
Trying to burn my house down?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.320
No.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.360
I’m praying to Thao Wessuwan.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.520
Touched something bad yesterday.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.440
Need him to protect the two of us.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.159
When did you buy all this?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.360
Oh.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.800
I woke up around five.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.720
Went to the market on purpose.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.440
You should pray with me.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.800
He’s been protecting you all along.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.200
I can pray for you,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.560
but all I can do is dedicate merit for you.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.120
The rest is something you need to do yourself.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.240
Stuff like this comes from the heart.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.520
And this Thao Wessuwan,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.000
my mom gave him to me.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.240
Of course I have to respect him.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.840
And if you weren’t tied to cases like this,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.320
I wouldn’t ask you to pray yourself.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.840
What now?

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.480
The Phirot Ring.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.120
Old folks say

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.240
wearing it keeps danger away.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.680
You making this up to fool me?

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.800
Just because I gave in a little?

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.360
You’re delusional.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.840
Just wear it.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.880
I even rented it from a hardcore master.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.440
Think of it as fashion if you want.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.920
Then why are you wearing one?

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.440
They have to be worn as a pair?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.880
Of course they do.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.840
We’re dealing with
witchcraft cases all the time now.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.040
You think I’d rent one just for you?

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.799
I need to survive too.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.200
I don’t want to wear a matching ring with you.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.799
Everyone knows it’s a Phirot Ring.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.640
No one thinks it’s a couple ring.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.360
Only…

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.280
someone clueless like you.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.440
Hey, you little,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.360
The ring does look kinda cool though.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.120
Time to eat.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.320
Hey, P'Singha, wait.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.080
Where’s the food, Thup?

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.840
Uh…

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.920
I spent all my money on offerings today.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.720
So I think you might have to…

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.880
eat red apples, grapes,
pomegranate, dragon fruit

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.200
instead of breakfast.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.640
Hey, no, no.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.880
We’ll just eat out.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.880
Oh, okay.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.400
Let’s go.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.840
Why are you here?

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.360
Got yourself a smart little
suspect guarding your house now?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.920
How many times do I have to say it?

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.760
Thup is a witness.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.240
Not a suspect.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.360
And you? How did you get in?

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.080
Same way I always did.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.360
I got in the same way now.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.080
You gonna tell me yet?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.800
Why you’re here.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.720
Or should I arrest you for trespassing?

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.160
Fine.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.560
I’ll give in.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.640
I just came to warn you about last night.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.720
Inspector Singha letting
outsiders enter a crime scene,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.680
that’s not good at all.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.800
We already pulled them out.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.000
And more importantly,
the scene wasn’t damaged.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.040
And you, head of the special unit,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.040
what were you doing?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.360
Just sitting around?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.880
Collecting a paycheck, huh?

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.080
The scene may not be damaged,

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.680
but the case can be.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.800
And more importantly,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.760
a cop like you went and did that on camera.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.720
I went in because Thup saw a ghost.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.520
A ghost.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.920
Someone like you believes in ghosts?

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.800
I don’t.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.440
But anything that protects
the only witness in this case, I’ll do it.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.840
Clear?

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.120
I could let last night slide.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.240
But hurry up.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.600
I need this case closed fast.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.720
Orders from headquarters.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.160
I hope you won’t waste time
playing ghost games,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.040
and forget what matters.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.360
Because if you get transferred this time,

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.160
no one can save you.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.400
What’s wrong?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.400
I’m fine.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.320
Let’s go.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.600
You worried about hugging on
the live last night?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.800
Don’t worry.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.160
I handled it.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.120
I was just thinking…

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.400
where you hide your keys so
P'King can’t find them.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.600
The spare key?

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.680
Why do you need to know?

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.040
You go home with me every day anyway.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.520
Or you planning something?

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.600
Don’t let me find out.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.360
I’ll lock you up for sure.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.720
It’s not like that.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.120
I may not have money,

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.720
but I’ve never thought of
stealing from anyone.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.680
Including stealing someone
who already belongs to someone else.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.480
If he really was your boyfriend,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.520
I shouldn’t be around you like this.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.800
It wouldn’t look good.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.640
I don’t have a boyfriend.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.880
No one owns me either.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.120
Okay, then.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.840
That’s a relief.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.400
What?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.320
I’m not gonna do anything to you.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.480
Someone like me,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.800
I don’t do things to people that easily.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.800
Someone I’d like…

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.560
can’t be scared of ghosts.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.400
And can’t be obsessed with the supernatural.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.600
What are you talking about?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.760
I didn’t even say anything.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.520
Why are you telling me that?

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.840
Mm.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.120
Oh, thanks.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.320
Hungover?

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.520
Yeah.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.280
Dehydrated.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.360
That bad? Want to call in sick?

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.040
I’m fine.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.000
But last night,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.160
I was so drunk I remember nothing.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.480
I still have no idea

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.440
how I ended up in your room.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.840
That’s you.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.000
Always crawling back here in the end.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
What?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.440
What are you staring at?

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.200
Can’t I tease you a little?

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.120
So last night was that fun?

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.440
Heh.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.120
Where do I ever party?

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.560
That was…

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.880
my first blackout in years.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.760
Of course.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.320
When you were with me,

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.400
I never saw you into that stuff.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.160
So why go this time?

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.040
Just trying something new.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.840
Maybe I’d find something new.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.320
They say

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.120
if you live the same way,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.320
you only meet the same things.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.520
And what’s so wrong with the same old things?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.160
And in your story,

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.520
that someone new?

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.760
Even if he is,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.839
it still has nothing to do with you.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.800
I’m thirsty too.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.319
Go make your own drink.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.600
(Did you get home safe last night?)

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.040
(Want to meet outside next time?)

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.400
We really didn’t do anything wrong.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.040
Just stepping into a crime scene

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.680
is already illegal.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.240
Didn’t you know that?

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.440
What did you guys run into last night?

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.080
Tell me everything.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.760
Well…

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.920
No noth… nothing much.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.800
– Shit.
– Jump!

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.560
You called, so here I am.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.320
It was so dark I could barely see anything.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.560
You’re sure?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.600
’Cause it looked like you
were running from something.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.320
See a ghost?

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.800
You saw it too?

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.760
Like it was coming to take my friend?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.960
Bom, shut it.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.800
Well?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.360
I barely remember anything.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.200
I… I’m sorry.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.240
I shouldn’t have tried to provoke anything.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.160
Sacred beings, please protect me.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.400
Namo Tassa Bhagavato…

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.360
I’m really sorry.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.400
Whose doll is this?

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.840
It’s not ours.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.680
We don’t know anything about it.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.600
You know something?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.920
You’re the one who brought us there.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.720
If you know anything, tell him.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.040
I really don’t know anything.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.400
I… I didn’t think
that place actually had anything.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.720
This headless doll, does it
have anything to do with the case?

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.160
You’re in no position to ask us anything.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.720
If I ask, you answer.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.640
So whose doll is it?

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.040
It’s really not ours.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.680
We didn’t take anything from the scene.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.520
If it’s not yours, how’d it end up there?

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.680
Sing.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.240
Ko.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.920
Take these kids for DNA and record history.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.240
Then release them.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.240
And I hope won’t see you posting

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.880
Or doing anything tied to the scene again.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.720
Otherwise,

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.000
Next time won’t be just history.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.720
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.960
- Go.
- Go.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.880
- Go now.
- Follow.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.200
Sing.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.040
Questioned so much, still no progress.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.800
I say go back to my plan.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.640
Plant charges on a witness?

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.040
Two years passed.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.120
You still use the same dirty tricks.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.800
Don’t get mad at me yet.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.920
I think you and me just now

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.960
Played good cop bad cop well as always.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.920
It’s classic.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.280
Bad cop role is for scaring.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.440
I’ve always played it like that.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.160
And you,

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.720
Just put on the good guy face.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.280
Aren’t you good at it.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.800
Go ahead and jab at me all you want.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.200
I won’t blame you.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.560
Just like that you and I
don’t have to try so hard.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.520
Still click the same.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.800
Makes sense you’re
my best partner ever.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.280
Wait, Sing.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.920
So what will you do next?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.840
Plan in my room.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.360
Or yours, fine either way.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.000
Don’t.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.880
Work better alone.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.160
Don’t want a partner.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.320
How is it, P'Singha?

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.000
What did the YouTubers say?

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.560
They swore they’d never
seen the doll before.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.960
Means nothing is moving then.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.920
Must’ve missed something.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.600
Thup.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.400
You said the talismans.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.640
And those clay dolls.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.560
Must be from a shaman’s house.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.480
Or a medium’s shrine, right?

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.640
Yes.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.720
Why?

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.200
And what if it’s a house.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.080
Or a center inviting people
to meditate and practice?

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.760
I just saw that the homes
of these two victims.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.120
Had the same prayer book.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.040
Searched it.
(Santi Tham)

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.680
Came up as Santi Tham.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.280
Santi Tham House?

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.000
Yes.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.520
You think there’s
something there?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.520
Religious centers.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.560
Should mostly be good people.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.880
Still have to check
to be sure.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.400
Feels a bit too coincidental.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.400
These two victims.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.200
Had the same prayer book.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.840
Mek.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.040
Yes.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.520
Send these dolls to forensics.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.640
- Might find something useful.
- Yes.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.240
And Santi Tham House.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.560
Look into it.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.040
And check.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.640
If any victim.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.040
Knew or ever went there.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.560
Yes.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.720
- Uh.
- Yes.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.240
There’s a ritual…

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.400
Let’s talk over there instead.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.440
Yes.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.840
What were you about
to ask me?

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.000
Does this place have
a Mae Sue worship ritual?

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.760
Sorry?

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.120
Like animal heads,
like a tiger head.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.520
Tiger head, Ekalai.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.120
Saturday’s Mae Sue.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.120
Guys like us.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.720
Know Mae Sue too?

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.240
Know a little.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.600
So… do they perform
that ritual here?

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.000
Hm. They don’t.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.440
It’s an old belief.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.640
Okay.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.080
- Thank you.
- Mhm.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.320
I checked what you
told me to.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.200
In the CCTV.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.400
Khun Thee went to make merit
at Santi Tham House every day.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.920
As for Khun Meen.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.760
The last victim.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.560
Stopped for gas.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.120
On the route to Santi Tham House
as well.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.640
Right now I think these
seven victims.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.840
Must have something linked
to Santi Tham House.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.840
And maybe the two
Siakaban dolls we found.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.000
Might have something linked.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.200
To the belief in Mae Sue.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.560
Each Mae Sue.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.960
Watches over those born
on each day.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.440
If so.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.040
These seven victims.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.720
Might all be born
on different days.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.640
Jame Jirayu.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.120
Born Sunday.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.520
Jom Jompon.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.920
Born Monday.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.720
Orn Orawan.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.240
Born Tuesday.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.160
Thee Thanakorn.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.440
Born Wednesday.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.480
Kaew Kotchakorn.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.000
Born Thursday.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.240
Nai Chanin, born Friday.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.200
Meen Phakaphong.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.560
Born Saturday.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.720
All seven victims.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.120
Were born on different days.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.840
If it’s really a ritual,
like Thup said.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.680
I think every victim.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.040
Might have a Siakaban doll
in their home.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.200
If we find those dolls.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.840
We can start forming
a hypothesis.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.440
Should I request warrants
to search the other victims’ homes?

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.920
Good. Do it.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.200
Phone, Earn, come with me.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.400
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.920
This is because of you.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.000
You helped me and the team
find links between the victims.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.720
We’re getting closer
to the killer.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.680
(Seven-Tree Case)
(Meen, Thee)

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.800
(Nai)

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.120
I’m glad.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.720
To help you.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.440
What is it?

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.400
Oh, the paperwork Inspector
asked me to do.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.120
Requesting to meet
Trewit, inmate in Phang Nga.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.920
From the similar case
ten years ago.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.520
Good. Tell them.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.760
In an hour, I’ll go in.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.960
Yes.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.600
Want me to go alone?

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.120
Think you want to finish
something first?

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.320
Nothing I need to finish.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.840
Tell them I’ll go in.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.240
Yes.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.920
And?

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.320
Will you take your
favorite witness.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.280
To meet the killer too?

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.800
Not your business.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.120
I’m the head of the
special investigation team.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.840
Your business is mine.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.240
Uh, P'Singha.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.720
I’ll wait at home.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.320
You’ll work more comfortably.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.360
Having me there
might not be good.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.400
You sure you can go home?

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.920
I can.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.280
Spare key.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.120
Under the plant pot.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.960
Leftmost of the fence.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.240
If doctors can’t love patients.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.720
Cops shouldn’t love suspects.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.320
Hope you know the line.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.720
How many times must I say.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.640
Thup and I.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.440
Are just cop and witness.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.000
I want to believe that.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.440
But right now you look like
a stubborn suspect, Singha.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.840
Don’t act like you know me.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.200
Because I really do
know you.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.000
I’ve seen that look
in your eyes.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.480
Before.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.480
You used to look
at me like that.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.160
Are you a chronicle
or what?

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.320
Always digging up
the past.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.240
What’s over is over.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.720
Someone like me,
hurt sticks.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.360
Watch me.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.440
I’ll do whatever it takes
to get you back.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.720
I’ll prove it to you.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.520
That I’ve changed.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.240
P'Sing.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.880
Can we talk?

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.960
Let’s go.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.360
What is it? Work?

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.320
Not work.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.520
I need advice.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.920
About Darin.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.720
You two getting back together?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.760
Opposite.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.720
I really want to move on.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.520
But damn.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.200
Feels like I’m stuck in a loop.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.680
Can’t get anywhere with anyone.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.600
Getting back with her…

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.440
Doesn’t feel right.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.120
Whatever makes you happy.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.920
Pick one and go with it.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.680
But.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.560
You saw what it was like
when we were together.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.640
How much of a headache it was.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.720
Let it go.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.200
With how you two are now.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.000
It’ll take a long time
to settle.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.840
What ring is that?

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.320
Thup gave it to me.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.920
He said.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.640
It keeps bad things away.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.520
In case the case involves
black magic, so we don’t die.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.640
Didn’t you not believe
in this stuff?

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.400
Still don’t.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.080
But if wearing it makes
Thup feel safer.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.720
I just… don’t want
to see him anxious.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.960
Oh.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.040
So you’re doing it
for Thup.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.280
Don’t turn it back to me.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.120
Worry about yourself.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.320
Ask yourself first.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.960
Whether you can’t move on,
or can’t do anything.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.560
Because you’re scared of what?

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.239
I just want both me
and her to be okay.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.920
I don’t know.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.000
If I really manage to move on.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.840
Will she be okay?

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.120
You? Move on?

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.320
You still worry about her
this much.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.040
How will you move on?

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.080
P'Sing.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.320
Even if she’s an ex.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.239
Darin is still…

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.840
A junior.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.440
A coworker.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.320
A bed partner.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.360
I still do everything
the same.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.719
I don’t want her hurt.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.719
Then why make it so hard
for you two?

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.920
I just want both of you
to be happy.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.720
But for you.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.520
You should start thinking
about yourself too.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.280
About what?

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.840
You know it well.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.640
P'King came back.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.240
Not just for the case.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.840
He probably wants
to make up with you.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.240
So what will you do?

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.320
Will you give him a chance?

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.880
Me and King.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.120
No way.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.240
I didn’t mean just P'King.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.720
I meant the one
who gave you the ring.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.920
P'Sing.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.040
If you have a way
to move on.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.080
I want you to.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.960
Don’t get stuck in a loop
like me.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.840
Messy.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.120
When the case ends,
you separate anyway.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.040
Done? Anything else?

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.600
That’s all.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.120
Don’t overthink. Go.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.560
Tewit Kengkitsakun.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.520
You’re the convicted killer
in the seven-body case in Phang Nga.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.480
In 2015.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.440
Can you tell me.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.320
What happened that day?

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.600
Hey.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.880
Officer asked you.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.720
If you’re asked, answer.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.800
Why?

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.440
What good will talking do?

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.840
Told cops a hundred times
I didn’t do it.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.920
Still ended up in prison.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.400
Cops don’t arrest people
for no reason.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.240
There must’ve been evidence
strong enough.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.440
That’s how you ended up here.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.120
The documents say clearly
there was your DNA.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.760
On the bodies.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.120
You’re no different
from those cops.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.840
Go.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.520
You’re wasting my time.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.960
I’m not like them.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.480
Who rush to pin the blame
just to close cases.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.640
You think I believe that?

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.800
Khun Tewit.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.920
If you tell me everything
one more time.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.520
I might find something
that could help your case.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.840
Bangkok just had a
seven-body killing too.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.240
Hanged on trees the same way
as your case.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.040
The one you were accused of.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.240
So what?

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.440
I’m already in prison.
What’s it got to do with me?

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.920
Because I know.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.880
This case has nothing
to do with you.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.160
And maybe the Phang Nga case
didn’t either.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.680
If you want to reclaim
your justice.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.880
Then help me with
what you know.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.320
Until I can close this case.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.720
And bring the real killer
to prison.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.240
I can’t return your ten years.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.560
But I can help you not spend
the rest of your life like this.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.760
I know it hurts.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.360
But if anything comes to you.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.120
Tell me.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.600
That day my father and I.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.160
Didn’t go out to sea.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.080
Storm warning.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.320
(Phang Nga, 2015)

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.440
But late at night someone
called me.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.920
Said my net drifted off the boat.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.520
So I went to check.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.920
Cut through the woods they
called the graveyard.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.440
I saw lights.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.120
So I crept in to see.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.840
And…

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.640
What I saw next…

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.800
Was the scariest thing
in my life.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.640
Cops arrested me.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.160
Said I was the killer.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.040
They said the evidence was…

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.320
A rope with my DNA.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.080
But that was the only thing
pointing to me.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.520
When was the last time you saw
the victim you knew?

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.760
Not sure, maybe…

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.040
The Sart Duean Sip merit day.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.720
Few days before it happened.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.920
And clay dolls or
Siakaban dolls.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.160
Did you ever see them
at the scene?

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.200
No. Never saw them.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.720
Excuse me.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.360
Yes.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.320
Where were you?

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.640
I… took the documents
to P'Sing.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.360
Had to take them in person?

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.240
Don’t you usually email?

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.960
Well…

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.440
There were some case
details to explain.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.120
And what’s this? What
are you doing?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.160
The doll P'Sing found.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.040
Hey.

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.760
There’s hair on it.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.200
Yeah.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.720
I’ll rush it to the lab.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.000
Maybe the DNA matches
one of the victims.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.080
P'Bew.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.160
Yes.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.640
Please run DNA on the hair
from this doll.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.960
- Sure. Okay.
- Make it urgent, please.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.240
Darin.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.160
Sey.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.040
What’s wrong? You okay?

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.640
Just now…

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.280
I thought I saw
something weird.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.800
It’s nothing.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.760
Your vision’s blurry.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.880
Didn’t you sleep?

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.640
Sey, I’m scared.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.240
There’s nothing, man.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.920
Don’t overthink.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.520
What’s going on with you?

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.120
Come here.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.720
Here.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.960
Hello, P'Singha?

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.040
Thup.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.720
Tewit said

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.920
around the time it happened
ten years ago,

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.880
it was during Sart Duean Sip.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.880
Some Southern ritual
or something.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.600
You know anything about it?

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.600
It’s a Southern ancestor
honoring ceremony.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.160
Held every wanraem 15
of the tenth month.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.360
The moon stays dark
the whole month.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.800
I can find that online myself.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.160
You got anything more?

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.320
Hmm.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.240
Grandmaster Monk once told me

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.320
about a ritual involving
the moon.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.240
If it’s during wanraem,

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.520
and you perform a ritual,

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.800
the effect of the occult
gets much stronger.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.360
Wanraem nights?

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.920
Here.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.120
P'Singha, do you think

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.320
Tewit isn’t the killer?

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.760
I’m sure he’s not.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.600
Otherwise how would it happen
every five years?

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.000
Makes no sense.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.920
I’ll be back late tonight.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.800
Need to gather more info.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.720
Okay, P'Singha.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.600
I told you I can stay
on my own.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.120
You don’t have to worry.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.440
You, though,

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.720
you’re still wearing the
Phirot Ring I gave you, right?

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.680
I am.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.600
What are you afraid of?

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.120
Nothing. Really.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.440
Just so I don’t have to worry
when P'Singha’s alone.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.760
When you’re done, hurry home,
okay?

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.640
I cooked a lot for you.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.200
Dry phalo stir-fry,

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.200
basil stir-fry, clear pork soup.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.160
You made too much.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.160
It’s just the two of us.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.640
No need to feed the whole block.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.920
It’s fine, P'.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.920
I’ve got plenty of time anyway.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.040
Anything I can do,
I’ll do it.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.840
Okay.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.520
I’ll finish up here

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.920
and head back to eat.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.240
Okay. And just…

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.760
take care of yourself,
P'.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.840
I worry about you.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.640
I’ll wait at home.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.080
Wait as long as you can.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.480
If you’re sleepy, go to bed first.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.800
Okay.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720
(Medical Examiner’s Staff Room)

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.240
It’s a clean-food recipe
from my shop.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.040
Saw you’re on a late shift,
so I brought you some.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.320
Here.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.840
You run your own shop?

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.560
Impressive.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.080
If you like it, I can make more
for you.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.480
Sure.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.320
This the guy from your story?

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.560
Uh…

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.880
Hi.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.720
Yeah.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.040
This is Bas.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.160
The guy I met at the party.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.440
And this is Darin.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.040
My coworker.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.320
Just a coworker?

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.200
Come on.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.000
You already had dinner with me.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.320
I can eat again.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.160
Oh.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.320
Old meals don’t fill you up, huh?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.240
So you need something new.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.040
What’s your problem?

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.400
Your ex just wanted to say hi.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.760
Is that not allowed?

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.120
Just curious,

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.600
what your new boyfriend
is gonna be like.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.600
Darin.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.520
I should get going.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.960
I’ll DM you later, Sey.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.360
Okay.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.840
Anyway…

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.960
thanks for the food.

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.320
Sure.

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.400
What’s wrong with you?

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.040
Why’d you do that?

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.920
What?

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.840
I just wanted to say hi
to your new guy.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.400
That’s not “saying hi.”

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.160
That’s starting trouble.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.120
Why?

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.600
Don’t want people to know

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.240
that I’m your ex?

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.080
What do you want?

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.480
Nothing.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.760
I don’t want anything.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.800
Then why’re you so mad at me?

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.240
Because what you did,

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.160
you’re acting like you own me.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.880
When actually,

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.880
we’re nothing anymore.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.520
Just…”sleeping buddies.”

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.080
That status,

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.280
doesn’t come with rights
to be jealous.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.840
What you’re doing,

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.600
it’s not okay for us.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.840
Get that straight.

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.800
(DNA test sample)
DNA test sample.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.360
Shit.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.640
Sey, pick up.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.520
Come on, Sey. Pick up.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.440
Sorry.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.480
The number you’re calling
cannot be reached.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.400
Sey, the DNA results are out.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.600
I’m heading to P'Singha’s house.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.920
Fuck it.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.080
Hello?

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.760
Huh?

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.320
Hello?

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.840
You really wanna mess with me?

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:49.720
You really wanna mess with me?

00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.640
Thanks a lot. See you tomorrow.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.840
Yes, Inspector.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.960
Hey, Lieutenant,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.040
have a beer.

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.400
No thanks, Sergeant. Early shift.

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.400
Alright, alright.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.920
- Hello.
- Hello, everyone.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.680
- Hello, Inspector.
- See you.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.040
- P'Singha,
- Hey.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.600
Thup.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.040
Thup.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.680
Thup.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.040
Thup.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.600
Thup.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.000
Thup.

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.840
Thup.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.040
Do you know where he likes
to go pray?

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.240
There’s a talisman sheet
stuck here, P'.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.320
Feels like this ghost doesn’t
want us to find the Tukkata Siakaban.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.040
We need to keep digging here.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.320
Santi Tham House.

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.720
Shouldn’t have left him alone.

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.840
You didn’t make him get hit
by a car, man.

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.920
Do you still feel anything
for Inspector King?

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.440
Being alone like this,

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.440
- it’s kinda nice.
- Who’s alone?

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.800
You’ve got me.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.120
(It’s raining!)
Grab your stuff and take cover.

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.960
May we survive this scene safely.
(Calling on the spirits now.)

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.000
My prayer came true.
(The deity has blessed us.)

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.520
(Came here for encouragement?)

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.080
P'Singha.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:17.920
(So happy, huh, Pel Pel)
He was protecting me.

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.160
I kinda wanna get arrested too,
but I’ve got no case.

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.280
(Just wants to get arrested)
We’re police.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.240
My ex just wanted to say hi.
Is that not allowed?

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.240
Emotional explosion, everyone,
but nothing’s exploding.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.520
’Cause he’s naturally a softie.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.000
- What now?
- What?
