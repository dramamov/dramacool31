Sir, please hurry.

Okay.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.140
Dao! Dao!

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.790
Dao! Dao!

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.990
Dao!

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.990
Mr. Yu.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.580
Where is Dao?

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.860
Is that Dao over there?

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.390
Mr. Yu!

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.510
Dao!

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.670
Dao!

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.670
Dao!

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.460
How is Dao?

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.510
This isn't Dao.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.020
(Do not go into the pond.)

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.350
Be careful.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.550
Where could Dao be?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.180
- Dao!
- Dao!

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.020
- Dao!
- Dao!

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.950
Dao!

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.830
Sorry, Dao.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.580
I finally found you.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.180
Thank you.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.900
Dao is safe and sound.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.350
I should get going.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.620
Stay safe.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.670
Keep warm!

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.990
Dao, look who's here.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.900
Dao!

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.510
Here you go, Xiaoman.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.110
Mommy missed you so much.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.700
This little guy is so cute.
And so chubby.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.460
How did you get so fat?

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.740
Thank you, Jia.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.950
No problem.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.910
By the way,
I need to be honest about something.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.590
I lost Dao

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.790
a few days ago.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.740
Luckily, Mr. Yu helped me find him.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.260
And to save Dao,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.670
he even jumped into a pond.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.670
Sorry, Xiaoman.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.470
It's fine.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.320
You didn't mean to.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.030
And look, he's back now.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.230
I just didn't expect it.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.030
I always thought Mr. Yu was
the kind of person

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.710
who only cared about himself.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.150
But someone who cares about pets

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.550
probably knows
how to care about people too.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.420
Right, Dao?

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.260
Sir, which one do you like?

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.470
Mr. Yu,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.990
thank you for taking care
of Dao these days.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.070
Dao.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.100
Let me carry this.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.230
I got it.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.684
I stepped on it, and I'll help you.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.180
After staying
in the hospital for so long,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.740
I didn't sell a single car this month.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.830
I'm doomed.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.350
I won't hit my KPI.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.710
I can't even afford your dog food.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.350
Dao, how about trying rabbit food?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.500
It's cheaper.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.340
No.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.260
Why not?

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.710
Nothing. Feed him whatever.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.580
(Yang Wang Dealership)

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.300
Why are you eating cafeteria food again?

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.160
It's so oily.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.150
You'll gain weight.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.550
Because it's free.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.030
Are you broke again?

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.550
Let me show you

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.260
my expense log.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.540
(This month's bill. Income
and expenses. Balance: -42.8 yuan.)

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.940
Why is your balance negative?

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.380
Did you not work this month?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.030
I went to the hospital this time.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.670
Mr. Yu paid a lot up front.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.150
I have to pay him back.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.550
So, I talked to the manager

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.740
and got a 3000-yuan advance.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.910
Honestly, our company is pretty humane.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.420
They take care of people.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.940
So, you basically have
no income this month.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.420
I just need to work harder

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.030
to sell one car.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.300
As long as I sell one car,

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.230
I can rise from the ashes.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.470
That's called making a comeback.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.070
Good luck.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.380
Good luck.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.220
What's up?

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.580
Um...

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.550
Can I borrow some soy sauce?

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.860
You're that lazy?

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.995
Can't you buy some yourself?

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.590
Well, I was going to buy it.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.990
But my streaming membership

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.780
auto-renewed

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.350
and deducted 22 yuan.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.990
Welcome to the Internet era.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.070
Wait...

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.620
The soy sauce.

00:08:57.595 --> 00:08:59.540
I only have this bottle.
You can borrow it.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.500
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.110
I'll pay you back with two bottles.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.100
Wait here.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.373
Oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar,
chicken powder, and oyster sauce.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.230
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.350
Don't thank me yet.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.110
You said you'd pay me double.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.990
This is my investment.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:45.990
Dao.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.260
Can you maybe eat a little less?

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.310
You've gotten kind of chubby.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.310
Fine, I'll work harder.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.430
Mr. Yu.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:25.710
What are you buying?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.100
Soy sauce.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:28.900
Walking the dog so early today?

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.470
Yeah, he's been super picky lately.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.710
Either he won't eat,

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.110
or he just swallows without chewing.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.620
I'm worried he can't digest it.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.110
I figured I'd take him out for a walk.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.190
What were you feeding him before?

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.620
My cooking.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.260
You know,
you could buy him canned food.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.900
It's pricey.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.500
Poor folks' dogs grow up fast.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.350
I can barely keep my own pot boiling.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.900
I'll buy it for him.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.900
Two boxes enough?

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.660
But...

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.710
Canned food is way too expensive.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.500
You're that broke now?

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.070
Don't worry.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.110
No matter how broke I get,
we won't starve.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.230
Alright, let's go back and sleep.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.500
Come on.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.710
Sleeping early to save electricity?

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.740
I'm listening to music tonight.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.830
Go ahead.
I'll sleep with my ears covered.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.830
Saving money starts
with saving electricity.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.900
Saving electricity starts
with sleeping early.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.500

Go ahead.

Do you want to buy a car?

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.460
A car?

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.010
I picked a studio close to home

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.380
because I don't want to drive.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.780
Finding parking is just too annoying.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.380
I actually have a scooter.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.500
But I never ride it.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.740
Wearing a helmet is way too hot.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.540
And it presses on the Yuzhen acupoint.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.540
So...

00:13:54.773 --> 00:13:55.860
You don't want to buy one,

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.500
right?

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.500
Thank you both so much.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.620
A huge weight finally came off my chest.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.990
Our home is in your hands from now on.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.140
Don't worry.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.110
Mr. Yu will definitely give it his all

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.230
to build the perfect home for you.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.310
I believe you.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.230
Great job.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.430
And thank you for your trust.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.700
Take care.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.220
Take care.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.780
The contract is done.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.230
Mission accomplished.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.470
It's all thanks to you.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.620
Without you, what would Mr. Yu and I do?

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.350
If he could stay silent like today,

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.190
he'd be such a quiet, handsome man.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.190
Right, Mr. Yu?

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.030
Do you want a car?

00:15:07.017 --> 00:15:08.230
I just changed mine last year.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.380
No, your car's outdated.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.830
Look, this one's the newest,
trendiest model.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.780
Perfect for someone stylish

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.260
and successful like you.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.990
Oh, please,
this is called being low-key.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.540
If I drove something that expensive,

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.140
people would think I'm taking bribes.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.000
Wu,

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:23.900
you should buy one.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.230
The price is fair,

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.190
great value for money,

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.830
and zero down payment, all installments.

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.500
Xiaoxiao won't let me
borrow from my future.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.190
Plus, I'm too broke to even afford

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.310
getting a driver's license.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:34.310
How am I buying a car?

00:15:38.217 --> 00:15:39.430
If you want me to buy a car,

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.950
then raise my base pay.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.830
Or point me toward
a legit way to make money.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.830
Take 600 yuan
and buy a kilogram of mercury.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.070
Mercury. You know mercury?

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.070
I know, then what?

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.470
Then...

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.620
Then you use tweezers

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.710
to pluck one proton and one electron
from each mercury atom.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.190
Then, the mercury turns
into 980 grams of gold.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.230
Check the gold price yourself online.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.970
Price of 580 grams...

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.900
For real?

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.720
I can turn 600 yuan
into a few hundred grand?

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.110
How do I even pluck them?

00:16:35.306 --> 00:16:37.230
You keep checking your watch.
Am I bothering you?

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.220
Yeah.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.020
You've been sitting here

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:41.900
without saying a word.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.780
What do you want?

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.540
It's hard to say.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.110
If you can't say it, write it down.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.830
Here.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.100
What's this?

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.430
Is this your dream?

00:17:13.017 --> 00:17:14.710
I need to look up some psych references

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.100
to figure out what this even means.

00:17:17.128 --> 00:17:18.150
It's not that complicated.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.230
Buying or not?

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.020
Well, this is drawn pretty well.

00:17:21.062 --> 00:17:22.230
I can pay two yuan for it.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.950
I'm asking if you'll buy the car.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.990
The car?

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.950
Look, this is the car, and that's you.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.990
Such a perfect match.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.340
Do I look that fat?

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.420
Relax.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.020
This car can definitely fit you.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.230
Get lost.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.340
This looks pretty.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.340
Full-bodied with a hint of fire,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.190
strength and seduction all in one.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.390
Gorgeous.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.580
That description is quite accurate.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.670
Look at that paint. Shiny.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.870
Those rims, so cool.

00:17:57.862 --> 00:17:59.230
What are you even talking about?

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.990
The Harley, obviously.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.540
It is a nice bike.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.910
It was my dad's first Harley.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.780
He loved it

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.390
like it was his own brother.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.540
I really want one too.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.740
Do you have a photo without you in it?

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.470
Look, you're blocking a third of it.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.670
Out!

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.790
That car.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.500
Give it some thought.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.340
Hold on.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.630
Are you helping Xiaoman sell this car?

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.150
I'm doing it for Dao.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.190
If it's for Dao,

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:48.780
care to make a bet?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:50.940
What bet?

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.740
My dad bought another Harley.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.300
He treats it like treasure.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.470
He's out riding every day.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.670
He's not young anymore,

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.020
and his riding every day
makes me worried.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.060
If you can convince him
to sell his Harley,

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.950
you win.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.910
Beating you is easy.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.820
But what do I get?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.670
I'll help you sell that car.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.830
Deal?

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:15.990
I don't need a car.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.710
I have a Harley.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.780
You're not a kid anymore.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.430
You're married,

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.190
you've got a wife and a family.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.580
A Harley doesn't suit you now.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.390
It makes you look too frivolous.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.100
Doesn't match
your stay-at-home-husband vibe.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.580
That's called "cute contrast."

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.820
Think about it.
You are riding your Harley,

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.150
taking your wife
to the supermarket to stock up.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.030
You're riding up front,

00:19:37.062 --> 00:19:38.780
and your wife's holding
onto you in the back.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.260
Where do all the groceries go?

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.500
Think again.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.190
You're taking your wife out
for a countryside ride on the Harley,

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.580
but the weather suddenly turns.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.390
Wind, rain, and hail come down on you.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.430
How's your wife supposed to stay dry?

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.910
My Harley's a single-seater.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.740
Doesn't that make it even lonelier?

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.710
According to the usage rules
of regulations for applying

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.100
for a motorcycle license,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.230
people over 70 aren't allowed
to ride heavy motorcycles.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.100
Judging by your face,

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.020
you're getting close to that age.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.470
So...

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.300
If I get a car,

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.100
what about my Harley?

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.540
You can sell it to me.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.170
You...

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.500
You go home first.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:36.670
I'll think about it.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.510
Sure thing.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.630
Think it through.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.300
Look carefully too.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.230
Yeah.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:03.990
Hello.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.630
Hi, there.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.740
Why are you here?

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.150
You know this bike?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.260
There are only two kinds
of motorcycles in the world.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.740
Motorcycles

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.190
and Harleys.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.710
You really know your stuff.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.230
Single owner.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.870
Original parts, and original paint.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.710
You want to buy it?

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.830
I have to.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.020
You're not even asking the price?

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.910
Don't insult me, and don't insult it.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.470
Deal.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:51.190
To be honest,

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.340
I'm really reluctant to let it go.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:54.470
Don't worry.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.060
No one's touching it.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.470
You could find a girl

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.820
who grew up riding
behind her dad on a Harley.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:03.820
I don't want to.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:08.790
Honestly,

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.470
handing my baby over to you

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.060
puts my mind at ease.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.580
Alright.

00:22:16.617 --> 00:22:18.020
We'll transfer the ownership tomorrow.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.710
What's the rush?

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.340
You should give it
a proper farewell ceremony at least.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.580
That's only right.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.580
As for that car...

00:22:30.617 --> 00:22:31.820
I'll go test-drive it with you.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.100
Sure, sure.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.700
(Harley Helmet)

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:53.990
Hello.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.190
Here. Double what I owe you.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.740
You have money now?

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.670
Of course.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.060
I found a side job walking dogs.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.060
It's 50 yuan an hour.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.540
Dao needs the walks anyway.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.660
Nice one.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.950
You look like
you're in a great mood today.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.100
I went to sell that car for you.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.580
So, how'd it go?

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.710
Well...

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:16.950
I bought a Harley.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:17.790
Goodnight.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.020
I'll go grab the documents first.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.020
What do you think?

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.180
Well?

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.820
Hard to say.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.260
Mr. Yu's referral doesn't feel reliable?

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.500
It's Dr. Gu's dad.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.500
He's fine.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.870
I think I'm the problem.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.340
What problem?

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.190
Too dumb to sell anything.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:03.470
I still have to push hard later.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.670
True. Good luck.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.020
Sir, let me walk you through this car.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.190
Young lady, no need.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.340
I'll take it.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.580
Five.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:21.550
Yes.

00:24:22.395 --> 00:24:23.500
I'll go take a look around.

00:24:27.373 --> 00:24:29.150
See? You're actually
good at selling cars.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.630
Why are you still so broke?

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:44.710
Five cars!

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.190
Next month, noodles are on me.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.020
Then, I want the real,
authentic oil-splash noodles.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:52.930
Sure.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.430
Order whatever you like.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:56.940
(Incoming call: Dad)

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.470
Hey, Dad. What's up?

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.230
Jia, uh...

00:25:03.284 --> 00:25:04.430
You're coming this weekend.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.340
For your "farewell Harley" ceremony?

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.190
Why should I be there?

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.390
Think about it.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.500
You grew up riding all kinds of Harleys.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.340
If you don't come,
the Harley will get mad.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.470
Seriously?

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.740
You're not setting me up
on another blind date, are you?

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.670
No, no.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:19.870
Absolutely not.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.430
Just come.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.420
Fine.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.870
I smell trouble.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:29.870
Xiaoman, come with me.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.780
And you decided to drag me into it?

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:33.750
Sure.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.060
What scheme could my dad even have?

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.470
Worst case,
he lined up a few blind dates.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.710
You can check them out too.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.060
And it's outdoors.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.173
Probably looks pretty nice.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.070
Treat it like a trip.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.470
Come on.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.020
Alright.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:51.060
He counts as a big client of mine too.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.260
I can't let this whale slip away.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.580
(Why is Mr. Yu coming too?)

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.630
You're not happy to see me?

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.580
You saw me from that far?

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:16.990
I guessed.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.990
Mr. Yu, if it weren't for your referral,

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.230
I wouldn't have such a big client.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.780
You're a lifesaver for me and Dao.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.060
Of course you're welcome.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.230
I was just curious.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.580
He's here because

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.300
he bought my dad's Harley.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.870
You really bought it?

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.580
Sure, the idea was hers.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.100
But, it was my talking skills
that convinced her dad.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.470
Amazing.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:45.340
I always felt

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.630
he was the type
with zero athletic ability.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.260
A man stays a boy till he dies.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.990
However, I didn't expect you
to have a motorcycle license.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.390
Back when I was in college in Tianjin,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:57.740
I got a full scholarship.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.740
Seven years straight.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.390
What does that have to do
with your motor skills?

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.780
And then?

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.060
Then, I bought a Vespa.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.230
The same one Hepburn
rode in "Roman Holiday".

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.190
Such a romantic movie,

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.430
and he finishes it and buys a scooter.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.390
A stereotypical guy indeed.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.540
I bought it
because I like Hepburn, okay?

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.540
Wow, you can even like women?

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.230
I'm a film buff.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.190
A film buff, you know?

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:26.390
I like Vivien Leigh too.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.230
Shouldn't you be into Schwarzenegger?

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.950
Shut it.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.470
Look up front.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.470
That engine roar is music to my ears.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.230
Let's head out.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.070
Okay.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:54.860
(Reverse and U-turn)

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:00.900
Welcome.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.660
Come.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.060
Let me do the introductions.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:07.780
That one's the eldest.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.020
He's number two.

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:13.740
This is the third brother.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.630
I'm the fourth.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.190
This is the fifth brother.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:22.630
This is Yu Yu.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:25.820
They don't have actual names?

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.500
Once you hang around enough,
you'll figure them out.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.060
Dad, you go bond with them first.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.910
I'll take Xiaoman over there.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.630
Eldest Brother, you handle it.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.100
How did Mr. Yu get thrown off?

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.870
This is their initiation ritual.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:35.870
I told my dad

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.340
Mr. Yu was delicate.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.630
They should know what to do.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:25.500
♪Should old acquaintance be forgot♪

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:32.190
♪And never brought to mind?♪

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:38.470
♪Should old acquaintance be forgot♪

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:44.260
♪In the days of auld lang syne?♪

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:51.560
♪For auld lang syne, my dear♪

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:57.910
♪For auld lang syne♪

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:03.820
♪We'll drink a cup of kindness yet♪

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:09.780
♪For the sake of auld lang syne♪

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.950
Five cars.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:27.910
I sold five cars.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.700
Up this early?

00:34:50.684 --> 00:34:51.950
You're awake this early too.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.180
Did Xia Xiaoman's teeth grinding
keep you up last night?

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.830
I barely slept.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.060
I've been having trouble sleeping.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.100
This place is really beautiful.

00:35:13.951 --> 00:35:15.462
How about we watch the sunrise?

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.310
Sure.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.620
I haven't felt like this in ages.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:26.990
It feels pretty nice.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:28.150
Is that so?

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.750
I think it feels pretty nice too.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.990
I've definitely seen
more sunrises than you.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.660
I sometimes see them
when I get off night shifts.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.100
And when I can't sleep,
I see them pretty often too.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.700
Why are you always losing sleep?

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:54.910
Nothing serious.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.390
Probably just work stress,

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.310
plus all the night shifts.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.310
That's autonomic nervous dysfunction.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:04.950
Your biological clock's off.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.350
You're not a doctor.
Stop diagnosing me.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.270
Who says I'm not qualified?

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.430
I've got tons of quick ways
to fall asleep.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.140
Yeah? Like what?

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:16.500
Counting sheep.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.500
I thought you had something impressive.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.500
I counted over 8,000 sheep once.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.500
My mouth got so dry.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.270
I drank a huge glass of water,

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.160
and spent the whole night
running to the bathroom.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.470
Who told you to count out loud?

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.870
You count in your head.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.350
And picture the little sheep hopping.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.660
Next.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.660
Drink a glass of milk before bed,

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.750
and eat a banana.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.990
Helps your brain make serotonin.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.910
Serotonin can help you
fall asleep quickly.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:47.750
Number three,

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.990
take a college-level calculus exam,

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:52.620
and tell yourself you must
finish it carefully.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:54.390
Number 21

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.020
is super important.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:58.700
Sleep away from your phone.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.390
(Number 66,)

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.700
(make one eyeball draw circles,)

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.100
(and the other draw squares.)

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:07.580
(Train your eyes to "fight each other.")

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.270
(Your brain glitches,
and you fall asleep.)

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:25.220
Number 149, white noise.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.700
Just listen to any sound.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.430
It can be wind, rain, or people talking.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.700
As long as it's boring enough,

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:35.660
you'll fall asleep fast.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:58.960

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.110

What...

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:26.790
What's wrong?

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.390
We were watching the sunrise.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:31.060
And it's already over?

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:32.630
You fell asleep.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:34.830
I got it on the phone for you.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.660
I'll send it to you.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.430
My arm's kinda numb.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:43.620
I need to stretch a bit.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.620
I'll send you the video.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.910
Are these bikes going straight
to the motorcycle museum?

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.470
A friend of mine runs it.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.220
Pretty good retirement for them.

00:39:05.373 --> 00:39:07.270
From now on,
if we want to have fun with bikes,

00:39:07.751 --> 00:39:09.540
we'll have to look for you,
Sixth Brother.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:10.830
What Sixth Brother?

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.020
You're a member of Steppenwolf now.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:16.870
So much trouble...

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:28.750
Fourth Brother.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:32.750
Sixth Brother.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.830
Good boy, Sixth Brother.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.340
(And just like that,)

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.140
(I got my own Harley.)

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:45.500
(I vaguely felt)

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.660
(I'd taken on some kind of burden,)

00:39:48.062 --> 00:39:49.750
(but I haven't figured out what it is.)

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.390
(Maybe it was the rising sun,)

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:54.990
(warm)

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.540
(but a little blinding.)

00:40:03.262 --> 00:40:04.390
(It's a beautiful sunrise,)

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.540
(and you fell asleep.)

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.020
(You should've woken me up.)

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:10.950
(Judging by your breathing rate,)

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.310
(you were in deep sleep.)

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.270
(You really needed the rest.)

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:21.540
(Thanks.)

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.950
(I haven't slept
that peacefully in a long time.)

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.390
(You really should thank me.)

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.660
(Half my body went numb.)

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.350
(You should start working out.)

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:36.220
(I'll figure it all out eventually.)

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.310
Thanks.

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.270
Thank you
to all the owners for choosing us.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.540
Our cars will never disgrace
the Steppenwolf's name.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.870
Thank you!

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.790
You only sold five cars.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:58.950
Is it worth being this happy?

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.660
Look at that smug face of yours.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.660
Straight-up vicious concubine energy.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.430
Now, you can go on trips without worry.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.020
The best part?
Your wife won't nag you anymore.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.060
I'm not scared of her.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.220
Then, why buy the car?

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.060
Exactly.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.540
It's safe and comfortable.

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.430
Most importantly, there's a roof

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.220
over your head on rainy days.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.750
Come on, let's take a photo.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:27.590
This way.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.060
Wow.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.020
Mr. Yu, this looks incredibly cool.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.500
Let me ride it for a bit.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.110
In your dreams.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.580
Can you let me be the Seventh Brother?

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.928
Not even the Eighth Brother.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.540
You're stingy.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.540
Mr. Yu,

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.350
is this Vespa yours?

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:01.540
I have never seen you ride it.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.990
You can think of it
as a decorative piece.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.910
You know how many people have
limited-edition collectibles at home,

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:08.950
but never use them.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.270
Oh.

00:42:10.395 --> 00:42:11.620
Then now it has a companion.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.580
It must be very happy.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.230
Mr. Yu,

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.950
your little scooter now has company,

00:42:21.951 --> 00:42:23.020
but you are still alone.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.870
You must be feeling extremely lonely.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:26.860
Oh?

00:42:26.906 --> 00:42:29.220
So after this little Vespa
and little Harley get together,

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.220
what should the surname be?

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.270
Should it be called Har-Ves or Ves-Har?

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.230
Get off.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.910
Fine. Come on.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.830
This is way too cool.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:42.670
I know.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.340
Yes.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.119
