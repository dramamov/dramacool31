00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.820
Honey,

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.259
I'll go get the car.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.759
Go ahead.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.500
Tell me.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.379
Why did you hide and avoid me?

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:21.459
Do you know how worried I was?

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.459
I missed you so much.

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:31.500
Worried about me?

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.299
So

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.959
you pushed me off that high cliff

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.540
and killed my child.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.420
Now you claim

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:40.900
you were worried about me?

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:44.219
I'm warning you.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.659
We

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.019
have no connections.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.939
Right now

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.780
I wish I could kill you.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.780
Is this how you see me?

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:54.500
That day

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.900
if you had

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.060
drunk the abortion medicine I prepared,

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:59.500
you wouldn't have

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.180
fallen by accident.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.139
Do you remember this place?

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.580
We used to

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.939
have so many passionate memories here.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.900
Ye Dong,

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:19.099
I'm warning you.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.099
Don't say that again.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.819
And

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.460
this is our final meeting.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.699
From now on,

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:27.419
we're completely through.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.740
I've blinded Lin Xia.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.139
We can be together soon.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.099
You're insane.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.139
She's your wife.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:41.659
How could you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.240
do such a thing?

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.780
To be with you,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.699
I'd do anything.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.460
We once vowed

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.020
to stay together

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.819
forever.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:00.379
I remember that.

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.419
And I won't let you break that vow.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:06.620
Ye Dong,

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:08.580
your love is twisted

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:09.939
and distorted.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.500
It terrifies me.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.500
You love him?

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:16.539
Deeply.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.060
You should only love me.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.300
I'm warning you.

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.259
Stay out of my life.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.780
If

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.139
he disappears,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.979
will you

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.020
come back to me?

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.020
I'm warning you.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:42.340
Stay calm.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.419
Don't make me hate you.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.500
Drink this.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:07.180
No.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.020
You're crazy.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.180
Drink it.

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.019
What did I drink?

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:20.519
Once the child is gone,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.579
you'll come back to me.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.339
Don't vomit.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.939
Be good.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.939
Stop being stubborn.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.860
Drink it.

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.220
Drink it up.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.079
No.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.699
Please.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.540
Drink it.

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.500
Ye Dong,

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:59.420
get closer

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:01.360
and I'll jump off here.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.519
You value your life so much

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.379
that you'd never jump.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.500
Be good.

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:17.180
Listen to me.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.899
Drink it.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.420
No!

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:21.740
No!

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.019
Please.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.300
Bai Cha!

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.220
Bai Cha!

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.019
After you fell off the cliff,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.660
I was too heartbroken to breathe.

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.740
I searched for you crazily,

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:39.220
but I couldn't

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.939
find you.

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:43.339
I thought

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.939
wild beasts had taken you.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.500
Losing you feels

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.819
like being abandoned by the world.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.740
But lately

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.699
when I heard you were still alive,

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.779
I felt alive again.

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:03.420
So

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.339
I'll never let you leave me again.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.220
Drop your act.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.420
You killed the child I was carrying.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.060
The original Zhang Susu died long ago.

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:24.300
The one alive now

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.180
is Bai Cha.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.579
We

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.339
have no connections.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.860
If you come again,

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.019
I'll make sure we both ruin.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.939
Let go.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.579
Ye Dong,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.899
I'm warning you.

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.060
Keep this up and I'll call the police.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.060
Go ahead!

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:49.379
Want to ruin together?

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:51.420
Then let it be!

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:57.300
Ye Dong.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.740
Ye Dong.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:01.379
Honey.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.060
Honey?

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.860
Honey?

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.540
Are you done yet?

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.240
Almost ready.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.139
I'll take a call.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.980
Then I'll

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.660
bring the cart over.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.300
No need.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.259
I'll be there soon. Be patient.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.540
Ye Dong,

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:28.939
I'm warning you.

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:30.220
Don't come here anymore.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.579
No future for us.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:33.100
From inside out,

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:34.899
I know you completely.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.120
Nothing about you

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:38.379
could ever attract me.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.680
Understand?

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.699
I don't believe it.

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:45.439
In your heart,

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.060
there's a place for me.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.139
Right?

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:52.379
Stop flattering yourself.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.019
Honey,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.259
put them in the car.

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:15.779
Your shoulder is hurt?

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:19.939
It's nothing.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.019
I scratched it accidentally.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.060
Who bit you?

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:30.899
No one did.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.459
Honey,

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.259
please believe me.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.860
You're the only one in my heart.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:37.820
I'm asking who bit you!

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.299
Was it Ye Dong?

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.299
I know you knew each other before.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.139
Honey,

00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:56.620
it was really itchy,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.659
so I scratched it.

00:08:57.659 --> 00:08:58.100
That's all.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.039
Please believe me.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.860
We'll talk at home.

00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:08.980
Get in the car.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.500
Get in!

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:18.940
Master,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.700
bad news.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.100
What?

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:22.179
A female body is found by the river

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.179
and it's confirmed

00:09:23.299 --> 00:09:24.139
to be Lin Xia.

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:26.899
Bring to me

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:28.059
the autopsy report.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:28.899
And contain

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:29.860
the information.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.100
Don't let anyone

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:32.220
know this case,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.059
especially Ye Dong.

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:34.700
Understood.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.620
Here, put this on.

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:00.820
Thanks.

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:01.779
I'll do it myself.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.419
I'm sorry.

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:07.980
I was too rough earlier.

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:16.419
Cheng Nuo,

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:18.139
let me tell you again.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.779
Under any circumstances,

00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:21.700
show no mercy.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.340
I know him better than anyone.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.840
He

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.440
is so paranoid he doubts himself.

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:31.740
Do you understand now,

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:34.000
honey?

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.720
Yes,

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:39.539
honey.
