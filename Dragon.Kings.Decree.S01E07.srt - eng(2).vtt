00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.839
Young Master's Yang poison
should be cured this time, right?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.440
Let's wait and see.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.039
Someone is coming.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.559
Mr. Nie, I wonder
what brings you here?

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.599
I heard Moshang isn't cured
from the Yang poison yet.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.159
I am deeply concerned.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.040
So,

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.040
I came to visit him.

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.398
Mr. Nie, you and Young Master

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.999
truly share a deep brotherly bond.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.958
But it's late now.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.320
Young Master is already resting.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.959
You need not to worry about him.

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:07.638
Young Master,

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:08.559
you're alright now.

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.838
Thank you,

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:16.040
Miss Zhilou.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.240
Rongzhi,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.200
you must be disappointed.

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:34.360
Moshang,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.159
what do you mean by that?

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.080
I couldn't be happier

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.320
to see you healthy now.

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.679
Since you

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.399
are alright,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.240
I will return to the sanctuary
to report to Father.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.959
Moshang, take care.

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:57.679
He is also one of the Dragons?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.040
Are the two brothers on bad terms?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.678
Young Master's poison

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:04.200
was precisely his doing.

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.078
With Lenghou Zong's abilities,

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.999
he couldn't have injured Young Master.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.479
It was all Nie Rongzhi's doing.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.358
That day,

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.599
it was him who set up the barrier

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.399
to stop us from saving you.

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.600
I see.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.479
Well, sometimes,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.520
our siblings want us dead.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.559
I've thought about it.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.759
Now that your poison has been cured,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.759
there's no need for me
to hold back anymore.

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:00.318
To be frank...

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.679
Are you sure about this?

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:04.758
If we go through

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.720
with a fake marriage,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.920
everyone will just assume
you've really married me.

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:11.280
For a woman,

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.399
this is no small matter.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.280
I want to leave this place

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.519
and see the world outside.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.319
I want to try my luck in Wujing City.

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:21.840
And,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.319
I want to fight alongside you Dragons.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.679
No,

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.319
what I mean is we

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.998
can go our separate ways

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.318
after I leave Feng Manor

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.839
and arrive in Wujing City.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.439
Don't feel burdened.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.800
I promised you

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:42.040
I would take you away.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.079
Young Master,

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.800
it's time to return to the sanctuary.

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:55.160
See you at the ancestral hall tomorrow.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:04.279
Hurry up.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.439
Everyone is waiting.

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:06.798
Watch out.

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:07.599
It's crooked.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.479
Adjust it now.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.358
Go.

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:10.159
We need to use it.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.959
They're waiting.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.719
Watch your step. Don't fall.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.758
Listen carefully.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.798
The marriage alliance
with the Dragons today is crucial.

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:17.400
No mistakes are allowed.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.358
Miss Yunqiao,

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:20.479
why have you come out?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.198
Today

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.240
is my wedding day.

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:24.438
Miss Yunqiao!

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.039
Go get her!

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.758
Now.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.960
That lantern is crooked.

00:06:30.575 --> 00:06:33.670
(Happy Wedding)

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.839
The time is approaching.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.160
Why is the groom still not here?

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:24.159
Could it be

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.878
that something has gone wrong?

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:26.558
But,

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:28.079
the Dragon Prince doesn't seem

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.439
like someone
who would break his promise.

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:35.959
What time is it already?

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.639
Why hasn't the groom arrived yet?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.878
Indeed,

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.480
how long must our bride keep waiting?

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280
(Shang,)

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.879
(are you really not coming?)

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:14.879
(I thought you
were different from them.)

00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:24.399
He's here!

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.399
The groom is here.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.319
He's finally here.

00:08:41.319 --> 00:08:42.399
The Dragon Prince

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.279
is truly remarkable.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.558
Miss Zhilou is finally married off.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.519
Good for her!

Zhilou,

I've come to marry you.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.320
Congratulations!

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:26.039
The time has come.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.519
Let's welcome the newlyweds.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.200
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.480
Second bow to the parents.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.399
Third, bow to each other.

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:54.879
Who is that?

00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:04.639
I'll check it out.

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:06.119
Alright.

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:22.399
What a lively event.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.840
Why haven't you returned yet?

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.840
If I had returned to the sanctuary,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.519
I would have

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.600
missed your joyous occasion

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:34.838
in taking a human girl as your wife.

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:37.200
I will explain this to Father.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.240
Your input isn't needed.

00:12:50.439 --> 00:12:51.879
Indeed.

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:54.960
I suppose this is beyond my jurisdiction anyway.

00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:56.598
Controlling the winds and rains

00:12:56.599 --> 00:12:57.958
was never my role to play.

00:12:57.959 --> 00:12:59.440
You've already told Father?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.919
I'll see you at the sanctuary,

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:04.399
my dear brother.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.239
Zhilou,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.999
I must return to the sanctuary

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.840
and explain this to my clan.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.519
Nie Rongzhi is causing trouble again.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.919
Innocent people may be harmed.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.798
The Icebound Sword

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:30.240
is inside the sigil.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.598
You can summon it yourself when needed.

00:13:32.599 --> 00:13:34.480
You're entrusting me

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.958
with such a treasure?

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:37.159
Let it protect you

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.438
while I'm away.

00:13:38.439 --> 00:13:40.039
I will protect myself.

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:41.999
I'll wait for your return.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.039
Young Master,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.279
it's really time to go.

00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:53.200
I will keep my promise.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.759
Wait for me to return.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.359
Father, please calm down.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.119
Moshang has received your calling.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.720
I believe he should return soon.

00:14:27.599 --> 00:14:28.720
Moshang,

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.320
you've finally returned.

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:32.798
I believe you must have had a reason

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:34.119
for marrying that human girl.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.759
Why

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.119
don't you explain it to Father

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.399
and beg for his pardon?

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.960
Father,

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:44.759
I married Zhilou

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.678
to repay her

00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:47.399
for curing my Yang poison,
thus saving my life.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.560
The Yang poison?

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:50.519
It's the Demons' poison.

00:14:50.719 --> 00:14:51.558
Only someone

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:54.200
with extreme Yin energy could cure it.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.919
If not, the victim's blood vessels
will rupture and they will die.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.519
If I hadn't met Feng Zhilou,

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:00.999
who possesses an extreme Yin body,
in the mortal realm,

00:15:01.319 --> 00:15:02.279
I would have

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.560
been dead by now.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.558
And the Yang poison in my system?

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:07.840
It was the result

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.799
of a sneak attack by Nie Rongzhi.

00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:15.320
Zhi,

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.320
is this true?

00:15:20.479 --> 00:15:21.600
Father,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.598
when we Dragons duel,

00:15:23.599 --> 00:15:25.078
we always spare no effort

00:15:25.079 --> 00:15:26.519
to prove our strength.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.320
It's inevitable that Moshang
and I would injure each other in a duel.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.639
But I would absolutely never
use such despicable methods.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.879
If I had intended
to deal a deadly blow,

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.159
Moshang would

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.478
not have been standing here

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:39.840
safe and sound.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.840
So you admit

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.440
that you fought me

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.840
in the mortal realm?

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:48.478
Father,

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:49.799
I was wrong.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.080
I shouldn't have hidden this from you.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.960
Moshang is destined

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.159
to ascend as the next Dragon King,

00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:57.320
and our relationship

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.480
would inevitably become one
of ruler and subject.

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:00.480
It was this thought

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.799
that led me to strike out
at him on a momentary impulse.

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:05.879
But I never thought the Demons

00:16:05.959 --> 00:16:08.759
would seize the opportunity
to savagely assault him,

00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:10.759
leaving him in critical peril.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.639
That day,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.440
I was also ambushed by the Demons.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.039
Moshang, if you

00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:22.680
don't believe me still,

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.320
I will atone for this with my life.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.720
Nie Rongzhi.

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:43.119
The agony of this is nothing

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:47.799
compared to the suffering
you endured from the Yang poison.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.480
If it were possible,

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.999
I would have taken that poison for you.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.560
So please, Moshang,

00:16:55.719 --> 00:16:57.999
do not forsake Father's expectations

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:01.119
or the mission of the Dragons.

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:18.400
Guys!

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.559
Mr. Lenghou is here with his men!

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.278
Go

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:23.440
into the council hall now.

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:28.599
This happened because of me.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.880
I will take responsibility.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.440
Your spiritual roots are newly awakened,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.200
and your understanding
of martial cultivation is still shallow.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.240
What do you

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.880
think you can possibly do?

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.359
Zhilou,

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:42.079
don't you understand yet?

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.718
Without the Dragons' protection,

00:17:43.719 --> 00:17:44.879
we're nothing.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.399
So stay out of this.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.559
I'll face whatever punishment
or fight that is coming.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.480
How could I let you bear it?

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.120
In your eyes,

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.079
all these years,

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.079
it's been my weakness and incompetence

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.319
that dragged our whole family down

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.960
and made us a laughingstock.

00:18:06.239 --> 00:18:08.359
I just never wanted
to sink to their level.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.079
I believed in keeping the peace.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.319
But instead, I became a pushover
everyone walks all over.

00:18:13.479 --> 00:18:15.279
I was wrong.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.120
I should have learned
to play by their rules long ago.

00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:19.440
Kindness should only

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.400
be given to those who deserve it.

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:30.518
Zhilou,

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:32.839
there are still so many things

00:18:33.439 --> 00:18:35.680
that I haven't
had the chance to tell you.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.160
For all these years,

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:40.200
I have caused you a world of pain.

00:18:42.439 --> 00:18:44.680
You must have hated me for a long time.

00:18:45.439 --> 00:18:47.640
Today is your wedding day.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.599
I can't
keep making these mistakes anymore.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.519
Don't hate me.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.480
From now on,

00:18:56.959 --> 00:19:00.120
no one is allowed to harm you again.

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:02.240
For the last time,

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.359
do as I say.

00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:16.518
Surround them!

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:17.720
Yes, sir.
