WEBVTT

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.410
Explain this to me right now.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.440
(Episode 110)

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.110
Tell me why those two are still married!

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.920
Could you give us a moment, Director Min?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.060
(Mingang Distribution)

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.200
Why haven't you filed
the divorce papers yet?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.860
Why?

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.330
Because it's illegal.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.140
You know exactly how you got
the chairman's signature.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.570
Don't make me laugh.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.780
Because it was illegal?

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.750
That's rich, coming from you,
whose whole life is one big scam.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.420
Sure, I had to claw my way up
from nothing...

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.250
and had to do some shady things
to survive,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.560
but why are you, born with a silver spoon,
so eager to commit a crime?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.460
Are you lecturing me right now?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.090
You didn't do what you were supposed to,
and now you're crying "illegal"?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.000
Do you have any idea what kind of mess
we're in because of you?

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.400
That woman, Lucia, is about to inherit
my father's entire fortune!

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.940
And he might not even make it
through the night!

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.870
He hasn't passed away yet.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.340
Aren't you getting a little
ahead of yourself?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.150
Stop right there.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.250
Didn't you hear me? I said stop!

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.420
I'm not someone who stops and goes
at your command anymore!

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.220
Those are commands you give to a dog.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.090
From now on, I'll go when I want,
and stop when I want.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.360
No matter who's telling me.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.230
Especially you.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.970
(Mingang Distribution)

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.950
I'll let go once you calm down.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.280
How dare you...

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.890
If you keep this up, I can't let you go.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.550
It's not because I'm afraid you'll hit me.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.090
It's because I can't bear to watch you
humiliate yourself any further.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.390
Humiliate myself?

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.060
Let's talk about who's really pathetic.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.930
Marrying an old man you don't even love,
just to get revenge for your daughter?

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.740
Or scheming to take over the company?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.070
Hey! Jung Lucia!

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.680
No, Baek Sul Hee!
Don't you dare mess with me!

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.410
I'm the one who made you who you are!

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.510
Please, don't be like this.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.980
You and I...

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.420
may not be related by blood,
but we were more than family.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.420
I thought of you as a mother,

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.130
and I was more heartbroken than anyone
over Ho Se's accident.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.800
I'm doing this for my Ho Se, too.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.800
My son,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.630
and my only blood relative, Se Ri.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.570
I have to protect her!
I have to protect her from you!

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.270
Are we clear?

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.110
You little...

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.480
What do you think you're doing?

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.580
Let me go!

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.820
Why are you falling apart like this?
This isn't the person you used to be.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.820
Please, get a grip!

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.610
(Mingang Distribution)

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.790
What has gotten into Madam Jang now?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.060
She thinks I'm going to do something
to harm Se Ri.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.260
If she's going to be like this,
why don't we tell her the truth?

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.200
But I told you she would go after Se Ri.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.830
Think about what Se Ri did to Mi So,
her own flesh and blood.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.340
You think Madam Jang
would leave Se Ri alone?

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.040
But how long are we supposed to sit here
and take this?

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.540
This feels like just the beginning,
not the end.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.410
Still, I won't let Se Ri get hurt.
Absolutely not.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.580
Yes, I know. I get it.
I feel the same way,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.620
but if we let
Madam Jang carry on like this,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.950
things are going to get much worse.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.220
It won't just end with the two of us
getting kicked out of this company.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.990
Someone could end up getting killed.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.490
Surely she wouldn't go as far
as taking a life.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.660
After all she's done,
you still don't get it?

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.900
Madam Jang is not in her right mind
right now.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.000
She's going to take out her anger
for her son on Chairman Min Doo Sik,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.970
and if she thinks anyone
is a threat to Se Ri's future,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.940
she'll try to eliminate them
by any means necessary.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.040
We have to stop Madam Jang's rampage.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.850
I know, but the problem
is we don't know how.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.520
Even Min Kyung Chae is
at a complete loss when facing her.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.090
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.560
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.240
Mother, it's me. Kyung Chae.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.710
Mother.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.950
What's wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.250
That Lucia, she...

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.150
What about Lucia?

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.290
What about her?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.760
You don't even know
what's going on with Se Ri?

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.990
And you call yourself her mother?

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.260
Se Ri's at home, of course.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.500
Lucia got Se Ri a job at a cafe
as a waitress...

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.400
for a measly ten dollars an hour.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.710
What?

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.840
Why would she do that?

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.780
Lucia is making Se Ri suffer
since she's not her real daughter.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.850
And there are so many creeps
out there these days.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.850
What if she gets a difficult customer,

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.020
gets into an argument,
and things get violent?

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.820
What then?

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.160
Why won't you listen to me?

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.360
I told you I'd take Se Ri to the States
and put her through college!

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.300
You haven't even told Se Ri yet, have you?

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.270
And you still expect my help?

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.700
It's just that...

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.270
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.310
What are you preoccupied with?

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.380
Lawyer Kim still hasn't filed
the divorce papers...

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.750
for Lucia and Dad.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.450
What?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.060
What is it now?

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.260
Min Kyung Chae found out everything today.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.600
That you and Min Doo Sik
are still legally married,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.830
and that I never filed the papers.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:35.870
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.400
And you're still hanging around?
Shouldn't you be on the run?

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.770
No. You won't find paradise
by running away.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.340
This is my paradise,
the one I'm going to build right here.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.850
Trashing the divorce papers
might've bought us time,

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.080
but if Min Kyung Chae proposes
my dismissal at the shareholders' meeting,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.390
it'll pass.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.620
It won't be that easy for her.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.360
If I give you all my secretly held shares,

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.290
not even the great Min Kyung Chae
can touch us.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.500
You're starting to scare me
when you're like this.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.100
Seriously, what has gotten into you?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.630
I told you. This is my paradise.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.370
I want a fresh start with you and Se Ri.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.110
What reason could be clearer than that?

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.880
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.820
Sul Hee.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.120
The past is in the past.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.790
Do you think I took off my engagement ring
to Min Kyung Chae lightly?

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.990
No. For me,
it was like starting a new life.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.500
I'm doing things my way
for my life and the remaining years.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.500
My new beginning
includes Baek Sul Hee and Kim Se Ri.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.200
Anyway, just keep that in mind.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.340
No one can touch us,
not even the shareholders' meeting.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.310
We'll get through this together
as a family.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.610
Okay?

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.080
Come on. We've got this!

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.290
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.430
Seriously...

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.470
So you knew the divorce papers
were never filed.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.810
Does that mean you were conspiring
with Lawyer Kim?

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.680
It wasn't a conspiracy.
It was the right thing to do.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.880
Forcing a thumbprint
from an unconscious man...

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.820
is a serious crime.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.120
You should be grateful
that Lawyer Kim's judgment...

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.560
prevented something terrible.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.900
Now that you know I am still legally
Chairman Min Doo Sik's wife,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.030
you're going to tell me
where he is, right?

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.100
As his legal spouse,

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.240
don't I have the right to know
where my husband is and how he's doing?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.010
Don't worry.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.510
He's in a good place and well cared for.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.380
I need to see that for myself.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.720
If you don't tell me right now,
I have no choice...

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.250
but to call the police.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.090
- You'll what?
- It's the only way I can find him.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.230
You know it'll be a missing person case
if his wife reports it, right?

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.540
Ja Kyung hasn't called lately.
I wonder if something's wrong.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.740
She's not calling
because there's nothing going on.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.310
No news is good news, you know.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.410
This much "no news" can't be good news.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.380
For a mother, you don't have a shred
of maternal instinct.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.720
I heard that
Ja Kyung's young mother-in-law...

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.220
dotes on Se Ri as if she were her own...

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.590
when she didn't even give birth to her.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.320
I always thought that was a bit strange.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.830
Let's be honest,
that girl is hardly an angel.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.500
She's a bit of a handful, isn't she?
Though she has been quiet lately.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.300
She was quite the troublemaker,
all on her own, wasn't she?

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.540
That's what makes this so amazing, right?

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.340
They're just mother and daughter on paper,
not by blood, but they dote on each other.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.310
Exactly.
Fawning over her like that isn't normal.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.050
Even your own kids can drive you
up the wall sometimes,

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.180
so it makes no sense to act like that
with someone else's child.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.150
Not unless there's some secret
no one knows about.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.420
What kind of secret?

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.860
What if Se Ri is actually
Chairman Min's wife's long-lost daughter?

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.930
Something like that.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.530
Are you writing a soap opera?

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.230
You come up with absurd secret origins
because you watch them all day.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.700
Why stop there? Let's make it juicier.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.070
Tae Kyung and our in-laws are enemies,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.700
Kyung Chae
is Ms. Stella's daughter-in-law,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.140
and Sun Jae is Se Ri's biological father.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.240
Want to take this soap even further?
Ji Seop is Manager Gong's son,

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.010
Ja Kyung isn't my biological daughter,
Tae Kyung is my son,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.610
but they were switched at birth.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.680
And for the grand finale of this mess,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.820
Chairman Min Doo Sik and I
are half-brothers. Happy now?

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.720
That's hilarious.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.520
It is? Maybe I should be a scriptwriter.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.630
- Whatever. Just call Ja Kyung.
- See? Over-the-top dramas are the best.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.430
Ja Kyung?

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.570
No, nothing's wrong.
Your dad just wanted me to call.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.370
Please.
As if anything exciting happens with us.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.740
Right now, all we can think about
is Ji Seop's promotion.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.640
But you said that was happening soon.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.810
I thought it was a done deal.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.450
It is, but I won't be able to relax
until it's official.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.750
Of course he'll get it.
If not Ji Seop, who else would?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.190
He will, right?

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.590
Mom, I'll call you back tomorrow.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.000
Your parents will be so disappointed
if I don't become a director.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.360
They're counting on it so much.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.930
Hey, don't jinx it.
Why would you say that?

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.640
I don't know, it's just...

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.810
the days are just ticking by,
and the appointments are getting closer,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.870
so I'm just getting a little anxious.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.510
Don't be. You should've been
a director ages ago.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.880
And it's not like it's some gift.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.120
We're handing over all of our shares
for you to get that position.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.990
But what will happen to Soo Jung
if I take over her position?

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.890
What kind of ridiculous nonsense is that?

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.490
Who's worrying about whom?

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.630
You're the most pathetic
of the Min family.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.800
You're the weakest.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.870
If you only knew.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.570
- The doors are closing.
- Hold on, please!

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.710
Thank you...

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.780
(Mingang Distribution)

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.920
The doors are closing.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.890
The second you walked
through the entrance,

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:36.960
you were radiant.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.300
What are you on about
this early in the morning?

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.070
You just have this way of standing out,
no matter where you are.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.470
Twenty-five years ago,

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.110
do you know why I chose you
out of all the women...

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.740
who were throwing themselves at me?

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.850
It's because you were
so incredibly beautiful.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.190
Why are you so jumpy?

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.590
A stray hair.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.430
Seriously...

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.300
(Mingang Distribution)

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.300
Does my touch still give you
an electric jolt?

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.030
The first time we slept together,

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.170
you were the same way then.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.070
Shut up! You're such a pervert. Seriously!

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.010
(Mingang Distribution)

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.560
Unbelievable.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.060
Why are you following me?

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.730
If you keep this up,
I'm calling Tae Kyung.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.960
You need to stop.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.930
If I'm making an effort,
you should meet me halfway.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.240
Do you think I let that punk hit me
because I'm weak?

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.670
No. If I got serious,
I could take him out with one punch.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.440
I felt bad for his pathetic life,
so I let him win.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.810
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.850
Now that you know Se Ri is our daughter,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.450
you've suddenly had
some life-changing epiphany?

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.120
Of course I did.
I haven't been this happy in a long time,

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.390
thinking about messing over Min Kyung Chae
and the rest of the Min family...

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.300
For goodness' sake, snap out of it!

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.270
Fine. You're Se Ri's father,
so I'll put up with this much.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.770
But if you cross that line,
I can't promise what I'll do.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.340
And what exactly are you
going to do to me?

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:35.210
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.310
What's going on?

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.750
He always stopped by around this time.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.690
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.430
Seriously!
This is Min Kyung Chae's problem.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.300
She just wears you out.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.430
A woman should be more like you, you know?

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.900
She should play hard to get a little.
Right?

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.510
Just go already.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.740
I told you if you keep this up,
I'll have no choice, right?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440
Yes, so?

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.580
What are you going to do to me?
Go on, tell me.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.650
I'm curious myself.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.550
You're curious?

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.820
Of course I am.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.190
My girl says she has something
in store for me.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.920
All right, then.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.830
Meet me on the rooftop after work.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.260
Now I'm excited.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.530
Wait a second.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.140
Is this about that kiss
that didn't happen last time?

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.440
That's it, right?

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.910
I knew it.
How could you possibly resist me?

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.580
I look forward to it, Baek Sul Hee.
See you later. Okay?

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.820
(Mingang Distribution)

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.360
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.440
Why didn't you answer my call?

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.170
Because I thought
I couldn't deal with you.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.680
What did you just say?

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.650
Who do you think you're talking to
like that?

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.150
We're engaged. Is it such a big deal
if I drop the formalities?

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.280
Do you have any idea
what I'm going through right now?

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.150
That woman, Lucia, basically declared war
on me yesterday.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.860
She said she would call the cops
if I didn't tell her where my father is.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.030
So?

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.590
"So?"

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.500
You can't act like this
at a time like this, Lawyer Kim.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.670
Then how should I be acting?

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.140
What on earth is wrong with you?

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.780
You wouldn't act like this
without a reason.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.840
Did I do something to upset you?

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.250
When you took off your engagement ring,
I thought you wanted to break up.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.420
Then, did you ever actually plan
to marry me?

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.750
- What are you talking about...
- Answer me.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.520
I'm asking if you were actually
going to marry me.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.230
And you have the nerve...

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.230
If she reports you, then so be it.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.470
If you don't like that,
then just tell her where the chairman is.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.970
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.680
(Mingang Distribution)

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.490
No...

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.100
- Excuse me, can I get some water?
- Water is self-serve.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.430
I can't believe this.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.440
What are you doing here?

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.440
How did you find me here?

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.740
Can't you see? I'm working.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.080
Anyone seeing this
would think you're the breadwinner.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.220
Who told you to go out and earn money?

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.580
It's none of your business what I do!

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.390
If you came for coffee,
find a seat and order one.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.860
You're going to keep working here
even if I tell you to stop, aren't you?

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.860
What if your stepmother tells you to quit?

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.430
- Well, that's...
- Really?

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.240
Then just you wait.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.580
Hey.
You'll never guess where I am right now.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.850
Our Se Ri is here, waiting tables.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.520
I can't stand watching her slaving away
like this for ten dollars an hour.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.020
What should we do about this?

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.190
She's not doing it for the money,
so please just leave her be.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.630
You can't be this callous
just because she's not your own blood.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.130
What on earth does she lack
to have to work here?

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.630
It's a life lesson.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.610
She will learn how to get along
with all sorts of people.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.170
That's ridiculous.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.480
I can teach her about life myself.
She doesn't need to learn it here.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.280
I'm putting her on the phone.
Tell her to quit this instant.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.280
Or maybe I should tell her...

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.050
everything I know about Lucia.
Get my drift?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.020
Here.
Your stepmother wants to talk to you.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.660
Mom, you wanted to talk?

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.230
Se Ri.
Don't pay her any mind. Just keep working.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.100
Learn how hard it is
to earn your own money...

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.270
and learn how to get along
with the people you work with.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.810
You can do that, can't you?

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.610
Yes. I'll see you at home later.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.490
She told you to quit, right?

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.320
See?
Why are you wasting your time with this?

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.560
Take that apron off and come with me.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.190
I needed to talk to you today anyway.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.100
- About going to college in the States...
- If you're not ordering, please leave.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.370
I have to finish my shift.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.900
That's what Mom told me to do.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.490
It'll take more than a glass of water
to calm me down.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.290
Are you really that upset?

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.930
Lucia was just trying to do
what was best for Se Ri.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.430
How is that for her own good?
It's not like she needs the money.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.370
Why is she working a part-time job
in some random cafe?

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.270
That's what a lot of kids her age do.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.410
- It's perfectly normal.
- No. My Se Ri is special.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.440
Because she is my son Ho Se's daughter.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.780
The girl who will one day own Mingang,
serving coffee?

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.150
Mother.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.420
You've changed so much since you found out
Se Ri is Ho Se's daughter.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.360
Of course I changed!

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.520
She's my grandchild.
Am I not supposed to look after her?

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.630
You're going overboard.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.230
I'm worried you're going to get hurt
if you keep this up.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.600
Don't you worry about me. I'm Stella Jang.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.730
Do you know what it took for me
to survive in the States?

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.370
Mother.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.410
Lucia says she's going to
report me to the police...

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.410
if I don't tell her where Father is.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.680
Since that snake Kim Sun Jae betrayed us,
this could all come to nothing.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.380
After all we went through
to get those divorce papers.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720
What are we going to do?

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.920
If shareholders learn of Father's health,
the acting chairmanship will be extended.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.420
And if things go wrong,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.590
the chairmanship could be
passed on to her permanently.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.560
I was only appointed to this position
without the board's approval.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.500
But she went through
the proper channels to get hers.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.570
So Kim Sun Jae has sided with Lucia,
is that it?

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.780
He realized he had no shot
at marrying Min Kyung Chae,

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.580
so he switched sides?

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.410
What do I do, Mother?

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.280
Just be quiet for a second.
I'm trying to think.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.470
It's so quiet.
I guess everyone's gone home for the day.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.300
There's no one else in the office.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.640
It feels like we're
the only two people in the world.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.780
Tae Kyung.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.410
Yes?

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.750
Kim Sun Jae is on his way up.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.280
I asked him to come.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.360
I need to make...

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.930
my feelings perfectly clear
in front of him.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.400
Your feelings?

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.970
What are the three of us
supposed to do now?

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.780
What, are we going to get into
a fistfight like last time?

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.540
Kim Sun Jae.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.250
I need you to listen very carefully
to what I'm about to say.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.580
I...

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.820
am in love with Moon Tae Kyung.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.870
You being Se Ri's biological father
means nothing to me.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.870
There's no way I'm starting over with you
for a pathetic reason like that.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.640
You may have been my first,
but that doesn't mean you'll be the last.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.710
The last man for me...

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.180
is him.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.880
So, just give it up.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.050
Stop using Se Ri as an excuse
to force your way into our lives.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.350
Are you out of your mind?

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.960
I've never been more clear-headed.
Now go! Get lost!

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.760
Get out of my life and my sight!

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.890
You've completely lost it.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.430
You're nothing without me.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.800
Right now, I'm your savior, your deity.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.800
Without me, you'll go down in flames
and hit rock bottom.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.500
Let me spell it out.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.270
If the shareholder's meeting is held,
you'll be fired.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.340
I'll take care of it.
I don't need your help, so go!

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.680
How dare you...

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.000
Back when I didn't know any better,

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.000
I met you and ended up having your child.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.440
Then you abandoned me.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.170
At the time, I was heartbroken
and thought my life was over.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.110
But not anymore.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.310
In fact, I think it was
a blessing in disguise.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.020
You...

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.890
want our Se Ri to be
the third-generation chairman, don't you?

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.720
Not a chance.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.790
I am never going to let that happen.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.660
I'm going to raise our Se Ri...

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.230
to have a perfectly normal life.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:59.540
I won't let her be a monster like you,
consumed by your ambition and greed.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:02.770
So, just go.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.710
If Kim Sun Jae abandoned Baek Sul Hee
20 years ago,

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.310
today, it's Baek Sul Hee...

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.450
who is abandoning Kim Sun Jae.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.140
Sul Hee.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.880
I never knew you were so brave.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.180
There's more you don't know about me.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.330
I've wanted to tell you...

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.860
that I loved you a long time ago.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.150
Baek Sul Hee.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.020
So this is how you want to play?

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.220
Fine.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.890
Then the gloves are off.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.640
You may not be happy to see me,
but that can't be helped.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.880
I'm here today to tell you
something you need to hear.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.180
And what is it that I need to hear?

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:53.320
I don't think I can say this sober.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.300
Se Ri...

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.530
is not your granddaughter.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.040
What are you talking about?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.880
Min Kyung Chae's daughter, Min Se Ri.
Wait, she's not a Min.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.440
Her real name is Kim Se Ri.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.010
She is Baek Sul Hee's daughter.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.420
Which means...

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.790
Se Ri's father is not your son.
Understand?

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:34.190
And I bet you're wondering
why her last name is Kim.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.430
Because she's my daughter.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.130
The daughter of Kim Sun Jae.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.350
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.840
