=Episode 4=

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:07.585
Father,

00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:08.825
I found Moshang.

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:10.704
This is great.

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:13.544
The Dragon God
has blessed the sanctuary.

00:02:13.545 --> 00:02:14.345
Where is he?

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:15.424
Where is he now?

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:16.826
Why hasn't he returned?

00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:18.400
At the Feng family in the mortal realm.

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:20.465
When I found him,

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:22.065
I realized

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:25.826
his sigil was on a bumpkin's hand.

00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:28.785
How did it land on a bumpkin?

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:29.864
I know

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:32.065
the importance of the sigil to Moshang.

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:33.745
I wanted to take it back,

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:35.865
but Moshang

00:02:36.106 --> 00:02:37.826
recklessly revealed

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:39.865
his dragon lineage in front of everyone

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:42.546
to protect that bumpkin.

00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:46.865
Sentimental fool!

00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:48.544
No matter his reasons,

00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:50.465
how will he protect himself

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.905
against the Demons without it?

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:56.305
Father,

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:57.345
I can't just stand by

00:02:57.346 --> 00:02:59.065
and watch Moshang continue this mistake.

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:01.146
Please ask him to return.

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:09.185
Is there something else
you're not telling me?

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:15.464
I found out

00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:17.424
that Moshang has confessed

00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:18.945
to that bumpkin,

00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:20.465
and they are living together.

00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:23.226
Summon him.

00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:24.666
I want him to return now.

00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:26.625
He owes me an explanation!

00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:27.745
Yes.

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:31.105
Mr. Lenghou,

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:32.785
what has brought you here?

00:03:32.786 --> 00:03:35.400
(Lenghou Ye, Head of Lenghou Family)
Feng Zhilou developed a spiritual root.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.744
And with the Feng family's
unique medical skills she knows,

00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:39.704
her engagement with my son
should proceed.

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:40.505
We can hold it

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.864
in three days.

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:43.345
What do you think?

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:48.785
Mr. Lenghou,
I'm sure you've already heard.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:52.105
I have no right to decide

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:53.625
who Feng Zhilou wants to marry.

00:03:53.626 --> 00:03:55.706
That's ridiculous.

00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:58.785
The alliance between our families

00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:00.426
isn't a joke.

00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:02.226
It seems you're set

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:04.506
on calling off the engagement, Mr. Feng.

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:08.065
Yunqiao is the family's heiress.

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:10.584
She's no physician but a decent fighter.

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:12.905
There is mutual affection
between you and her.

00:04:12.906 --> 00:04:15.385
Why not change the engagement?

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:16.264
This way,

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:18.024
both families

00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:19.225
will still benefit.

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:20.385
Feng Qingfeng,

00:04:20.386 --> 00:04:22.305
are you joking with me?

00:04:22.306 --> 00:04:23.985
The engagement

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:25.946
can't be changed on a whim!

00:04:26.025 --> 00:04:27.386
Lenghou Zong!

00:04:28.986 --> 00:04:29.985
You...

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:32.225
You jerk!

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.905
Was that promise all a joke to you?

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:36.344
I'm telling you.

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:37.745
If you wrong me,

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:39.946
I'll kill you today!

00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:44.506
Feng Yunqiao,

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:46.465
have you no dignity?

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:48.505
It's a marriage alliance.

00:04:48.506 --> 00:04:49.825
Of course we'd pick the woman

00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:51.505
who will bring the greatest benefit.

00:04:51.506 --> 00:04:52.505
You...

00:04:52.506 --> 00:04:54.465
You honestly think
you're in that league?

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:56.066
Mr. Lenghou,

00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:58.425
one mustn't be too harsh
in their dealings.

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:00.345
So what if we are?

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.104
Don't you know

00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:04.305
the weight your family carries?

00:05:04.306 --> 00:05:06.425
I'm just here to notify you today.

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:14.946
Father.

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:19.266
You're so useless.

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:26.306
It seems a storm is brewing above us.

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:29.425
So...

00:05:29.426 --> 00:05:31.024
you both are his subordinates?

00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:33.465
- Are you part of the Dragons too?
- Of course.

00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:35.266
Are you dragons too?

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:36.746
They are birds.

00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:38.826
They serve the Dragons.

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:41.290
But not anyone can hope
to serve Young Master even if they want to.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.266
The competition is intense.

00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:49.425
Do the Dragons

00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:50.866
have meals?

00:05:50.986 --> 00:05:51.865
When you eat,

00:05:51.866 --> 00:05:54.280
is it the same as us?
Food cooked in a big pot over firewood.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.344
Do you eat rice?

00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:56.905
Or do you not eat at all?

00:05:57.465 --> 00:05:58.905
Do you sleep too?

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:00.545
Where do you sleep?

00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:02.224
Do you sleep on a bed?

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:03.264
That's not right.

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:05.345
There probably aren't beds underwater.

00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:06.904
Do you still need to drink water

00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:08.186
since you live underwater?

00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:11.144
I have one more important question.

00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:12.746
Why do you have so many questions?

00:06:13.546 --> 00:06:17.065
Do you hear all of our prayers to you?

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:18.985
With so many people praying,

00:06:18.986 --> 00:06:19.945
can you remember them

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:21.024
and finish answering them?

00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:22.144
Also.

00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:23.224
Do you get to eat

00:06:23.225 --> 00:06:24.425
the fruit offerings I brought?

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.225
I spent a lot on them.

00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:39.305
I'm so amazing.

00:06:39.306 --> 00:06:42.066
I'm actually hanging out
with three dragons.

00:06:45.546 --> 00:06:47.105
Young Master actually smiled.

00:06:47.186 --> 00:06:48.866
He's never smiled before.

00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:53.186
I have an even more important question!

00:06:54.826 --> 00:06:57.584
I heard the Dragon Prince

00:06:57.585 --> 00:06:59.506
often slay demons and monsters.

00:07:00.066 --> 00:07:01.224
Tell me.

00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:02.425
Will I get the chance

00:07:02.426 --> 00:07:04.464
to fight beside him?

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:06.905
That has been my biggest dream
since I was young.

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:08.866
Your dream is grand.

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:10.144
Miss Zhilou,

00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:11.585
let's talk about business.

00:07:12.186 --> 00:07:13.104
The sigil on your hand

00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:16.425
was forged using Young Master's
reverse scale over 81 days and nights.

00:07:16.426 --> 00:07:17.464
If it sustains any damage,

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:18.385
our Young Master

00:07:18.386 --> 00:07:19.706
will suffer unpredictable harm.

00:07:19.946 --> 00:07:21.826
So we can't leave now.

00:07:21.905 --> 00:07:24.626
We must protect the sigil
and ensure it remains intact.

00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:26.825
What should I do then?

00:07:26.826 --> 00:07:27.305
You...

00:07:27.306 --> 00:07:28.784
Every time I touch you,

00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:30.865
my Yang poison seems to ease a little.

00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:32.146
So from now on,

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:34.985
you must stay by my side at all times.

00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:38.506
I have an idea.

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:39.306
What is it?

00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:43.905
It's what I told you before.

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:45.746
Fake a marriage with me.

00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:47.706
Take me away from the Feng family.

00:07:47.785 --> 00:07:50.105
We'll find an expert
to remove the sigil.

00:07:50.785 --> 00:07:52.025
I swear.

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:54.224
Before the sigil is returned to you,

00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:55.784
I won't leave your side
even for a second.

00:07:55.785 --> 00:07:57.386
Is this the only way?

00:07:57.986 --> 00:07:58.904
Miss Zhilou,

00:07:58.905 --> 00:08:00.385
the marriage isn't happening no matter

00:08:00.386 --> 00:08:01.306
if it's real or fake.

00:08:04.145 --> 00:08:05.264
Outsiders won't know

00:08:05.265 --> 00:08:06.985
it's a fake marriage.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.826
They'll think you've married me.

00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:10.465
This isn't a small matter

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:11.826
for women.

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:14.585
I cannot agree to such

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.104
an irresponsible matter.

00:08:16.105 --> 00:08:17.545
Yes.

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:19.105
You're right.

00:08:20.426 --> 00:08:21.545
But I...

00:08:25.746 --> 00:08:26.866
I was foolish.

00:08:27.145 --> 00:08:29.025
I'll think of something else.

00:08:37.506 --> 00:08:39.226
That darn Feng Zhilou!

00:08:45.306 --> 00:08:46.584
Such a small matter.

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:48.425
Why are you so angry over it?

00:08:50.705 --> 00:08:51.905
Who are you?

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:53.266
Who let you in?

00:08:56.705 --> 00:08:59.586
Do you want revenge
on Feng Zhilou's wild man?

00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:02.425
I can help you?

00:09:03.946 --> 00:09:05.425
You, of all people?

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:12.586
He's got the Yang poison.

00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:14.586
I can lend you a hand.

00:09:27.105 --> 00:09:28.226
Zhilou.

00:09:30.385 --> 00:09:31.506
Zhilou.

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:38.545
Zhilou.

00:09:39.385 --> 00:09:40.145
What is it?

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:41.945
You said you wanted to leave.

00:09:41.946 --> 00:09:43.945
Is it because you found someone
you want to marry?

00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:46.545
Was it the man in your room?

00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:53.665
Was it the man in your room?

00:09:55.146 --> 00:09:56.866
How far have things progressed
between you two?

00:09:58.426 --> 00:09:59.506
Uncle Qingyun.

00:10:23.946 --> 00:10:25.586
So what if you're a dragon?

00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:28.586
You're kneeling before me right now.

00:10:32.146 --> 00:10:33.425
Chu Moshang.

00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:35.626
If you beg me now,

00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:37.825
perhaps I'll be nice

00:10:38.546 --> 00:10:39.986
and spare your life

00:10:40.345 --> 00:10:41.626
Beg me.

00:10:42.385 --> 00:10:43.825
Beg me!

00:10:45.266 --> 00:10:46.905
Chu Moshang.

00:10:47.465 --> 00:10:49.386
Beg me.

00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:12.346
What does this mean?

00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:17.506
Is Chu Moshang in danger?

00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:27.665
Chu Moshang!

00:11:32.987 --> 00:11:35.628
(The sigil allows me
to sense his location.)

00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:37.106
He should be nearby.

00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:39.466
Chu Moshang!

00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:52.586
Chu Moshang!

Don't be scared.

00:12:15.585 --> 00:12:16.504
I'm fine.

00:12:16.505 --> 00:12:17.185
I'm not.

00:12:17.186 --> 00:12:18.266
We have the sigil.

00:12:18.546 --> 00:12:19.864
He came prepared.

00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:21.145
I'm severely wounded.

00:12:21.146 --> 00:12:23.984
The sigil might not last long.
You need to leave now.

00:12:23.985 --> 00:12:24.824
Stop talking nonsense.

00:12:25.985 --> 00:12:27.866
I can't keep having you protect me only.

No wonder Young Master
could survive for so long.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.665
She has...

00:14:20.705 --> 00:14:22.065
Extreme Yin body.

00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:24.224
There's extreme Yin energy in her body.

00:14:24.225 --> 00:14:25.945
That's the best counter
to the Yang poison.

00:14:25.985 --> 00:14:28.305
She is Young Master's antidote.

00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:33.266
What do you mean?

00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:41.226
I willingly submit to the will
of the Wujing Saintess.

00:14:41.546 --> 00:14:43.305
I heed your summoning.

00:14:43.306 --> 00:14:45.145

What is this place?

00:15:03.946 --> 00:15:05.624
The space in the sigil.

00:15:05.625 --> 00:15:06.785
Canglong Pavilion.

00:15:06.985 --> 00:15:08.106
This...

00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:11.506
is the space within the sigil?

00:15:13.985 --> 00:15:15.545
How did I get in?

00:15:16.826 --> 00:15:18.386
The sigil merged with you.

00:15:18.426 --> 00:15:21.305
It seems to also create
a connection between our souls.

00:15:22.026 --> 00:15:23.945
Soul connection?

00:15:24.786 --> 00:15:26.146
Just like in the legends

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.146
where the Saintess
fought alongside the Dragons

00:15:28.186 --> 00:15:30.545
and sealed a life-and-death soul pact?

00:15:30.745 --> 00:15:32.825
I don't know
if it's a life-and-death pact.

00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:34.624
The sigil

00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:36.466
still holds many secrets I don't know.

00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:38.586
But this...

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:40.425
was my private space.

00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:42.545
Now you can enter too.

00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:45.025
