WEBVTT

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.910
Hard to believe, isn't it?

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.940
I suppose it feels like
your world is ending.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.450
It'd be stranger
if you believed me right away.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.290
I'm telling you, Se Ri is my daughter.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.090
What's wrong with you, Kim Sun Jae?
Have you lost your mind?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.230
How dare you come in here
spouting such nonsense!

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.130
We even did
a grandparentage DNA verification test.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.800
Of course you did.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.270
I pulled a lot of strings
to make it happen.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.040
This is the paternity test result
for Baek Sul Hee and Se Ri.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.780
Twenty years ago,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.420
on the day Min Kyung Chae gave birth
to your son Ho Se's daughter,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.260
Baek Sul Hee gave birth to my daughter
at the very same time.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.730
And as if by fate,
the two babies were switched.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.260
In other words,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.330
your granddaughter is Mi So,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.070
who jumped from the rooftop
of Mingang Distribution four years ago,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.500
and Se Ri is my daughter.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.910
You crazy jerk!

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.280
Stop spewing nonsense and get out.
Get out now!

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.580
Very well.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.310
I'm sure none of this is sinking in.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.620
But these are the facts.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.450
Min Kyung Chae may not know,
but Baek Sul Hee knows everything.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.360
And you don't even realize
that woman is playing you for a fool.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.620
Tired?

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.520
Here. Fruit is the best thing
when you're tired. Have some.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.290
How much longer do I have
to do this part-time job?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.300
You can quit tomorrow if you want.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.100
I'm not going to force you.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.400
But, Se Ri, I want you to live
like a normal 20-year-old.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.470
That includes working a part-time job
like other people your age.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.580
Is it that hard?

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.750
The other stuff is manageable,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.920
but it's the rude customers
that bother me.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.320
How so?

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.760
They're just rude and talk down to me.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.290
I wouldn't mind if they were older.
But they're clearly my age.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.930
It's this whole "I'm the customer,
you're just the worker" attitude.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.700
Their power trip is insane.
I'm telling you.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.740
Se Ri, have you ever done that?

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.710
Have you been rude to someone your own age
working in a cafe?

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.510
Just because you were in a bad mood,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.280
have you made someone feel awful
for no good reason?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.850
Me? Well...

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.120
When would I ever go
to a place like a cafe?

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.830
If I'm having coffee, it's at a hotel.
I don't go to dumps like that.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.470
Are you just pretending not to remember
in front of me,

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.470
or do you really not remember?

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.370
Se Ri.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.710
If you can't remember Mi So,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.440
then I can't recognize you.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.020
I'm only doing this
because you told me to.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.090
It's boring and pointless.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.590
It's just exhausting.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.130
Still, try to stick with it
as long as you can.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.800
I promise you.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.100
It'll definitely be a good opportunity
for you.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.940
To learn about life
and reflect on yourself.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.210
Tae Joo, why should I believe
a lunatic like him?

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.650
I'm not sure.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.050
But it would be hard
to lie about something like this.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.850
We could just run our own test
and find out immediately.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.390
Then it's really not Se Ri,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.490
but Mi So, who died, is Ho Se's daughter?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.430
Were the two babies really switched?
How could something like that happen?

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.700
If you're worried, should I look into it?
Maybe go see CEO Min?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.170
But he said she didn't know anything.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.910
But since she didn't know,
she just did the paternity test back then.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.150
But he said Lucia knows, right?

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.420
She must have been
laughing her head off...

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.290
as she watched me make such a fuss,
thinking her kid was my bloodline.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.220
It's probably the opposite.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.400
Watching you dote on Se Ri
without knowing a thing,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.200
Lucia probably felt sorry for you.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.540
No way.
She wanted me to be fooled to the end...

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.540
so I'd make her precious daughter
the heir to Mingang.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.610
If that were true, she would have done
whatever it took to silence Lawyer Kim...

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.680
to keep the secret from getting out.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.060
After four years with her,
do you still not know Lucia at all?

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.160
That's not the issue right now.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.660
If the two babies really were switched,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.660
that means Mi So is Ho Se's daughter.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.500
And I know...

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.800
what a horrible end she came to.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.770
How am I supposed to just let this go?

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.610
(Notice of
Emergency Shareholders' Meeting)

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.550
(Agenda: Motion for the Dismissal
of Acting Chairman Jung Lucia)

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.050
(Chairman Min Doo Shik)

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.420
Did you see the company intranet?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.420
I just saw it.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.890
There's still time. Should we try
to block the shareholders' meeting?

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.060
- There might be a way.
- That will be difficult.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.160
The largest shareholder can call
the shareholders' meeting at any time,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.970
as long as
the proper procedures are followed.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.100
My dismissal will be decided
at the shareholders' meeting, won't it?

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.870
It'll pass immediately
as long as they have a quorum.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.440
But you never know if we can find
grounds to postpone it.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.480
They followed all rules and procedures,
so we have no real grounds for a delay.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.910
There is one thing, though.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.450
There are absolutely no grounds
for your dismissal.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.190
They're just pushing you out
because you don't fit in with their plans.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.420
If we appeal to that...

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.190
It won't be easy.
They're all on Min Kyung Chae's side.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.060
Still, we have to block it
as much as we possibly can.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.430
And if that doesn't work,
let's gather as much support...

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.500
as we can with our shares combined
and mount a defense.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.410
How long are you going to act like this?
This is childish.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.740
(Mingang Distribution)

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.740
If you're upset with me, just say so.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.910
Don't act out and sulk like this.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.310
I'm sure you don't have time
to worry about me.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.950
You're calling a shareholders' meeting
to get Lucia fired,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.820
and then you can be the CEO
or the chairman all by yourself.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.890
You can just have it all.
Why bother with me?

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.660
What on earth is wrong with you?

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.360
I even let it slide
when you took off your engagement ring.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.830
I'm so grateful I could cry.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.270
Forgive me. I forgot my place
when I took off a ring I never deserved.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.640
But about that ring...

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.710
You were the one who took it off first,
Min Kyung Chae.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.240
What did you just say?

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.380
And another thing.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.780
- "Min Kyung Chae"?
- Or should I be calling you "Master"?

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.490
Once Lucia and Moon Tae Kyung are gone,
it'll be your perfect little world.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.130
You won't need someone like me then.
Right?

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.600
But you're overlooking one thing.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.170
Those nominee shares
that I'm secretly managing...

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.770
Although I'm doing it
under the chairman's orders,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.070
I could still use my voting rights
as I see fit if I really wanted to.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.550
Who I back is the key
to this whole battle for control.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.380
And without my support,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.150
do you really think Min Kyung Chae
can be the majority shareholder?

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.250
Are you threatening me?

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.650
So...

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.090
what is it you want from me?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.960
What exactly can you do for me?

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.560
If I wanted to get married tomorrow,
could you do that?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.570
An old hound is useless, isn't it?

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.970
But it seems you forgot...

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.570
that even a hound can turn on its master.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.690
It's been quiet around the house lately.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.120
During the day, it's just the two of us.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.190
Where does Se Ri keep going all the time?

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.260
She's working a part-time job now,
waiting tables at a cafe.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.660
My gosh. Why would she do that?
It's not like she needs the money.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.000
I know, right?

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.640
Madam Jung made her do it,
but how could she make her do that?

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.010
She's obviously trying to make her suffer.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.410
It's to get back at Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.140
I don't get why she would make Se Ri
do something like that,

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.950
but how is that supposed to get back
at Kyung Chae?

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.720
Of course it's to get back at her!

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.350
You know who Ms. Se Ri is
to Ms. Kyung Chae, don't you?

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.290
How do you think Ms. Kyung Chae feels
watching her get treated so badly?

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.820
Wait. What exactly does Se Ri mean
to Kyung Chae?

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.260
Is there some other secret
besides them being half-sisters?

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.360
Like a secret about her birth
or something?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.230
That's as ridiculous as a penguin
on top of Mount Everest...

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.800
selling shaved ice.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.400
A birth secret? Don't be ridiculous.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.110
- Good grief.
- My goodness!

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.440
You don't have to lash out
if that wasn't the case.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.480
And by the way, what you said
about the penguin on Mount Everest...

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.780
is actually a phrase my dad holds
the copyrights to.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.450
You can't just go around using it
without permission.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.390
That's a classic Oh Pan Sool quote.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.920
Is someone talking about me?
My ears are burning.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.460
Someone's probably badmouthing you.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.930
You've done more than enough
to deserve it.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.660
It's hardly a surprise.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.530
Now you're just spouting nonsense,
like a woodpecker breaking its own beak.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.470
I don't badmouth people,
and people don't badmouth me.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.500
I'm practically a saint,
halfway between Buddha and Confucius.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.810
The Buddha? Sure.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.380
You have absolutely no self-awareness.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.280
Not only are your looks hopeless,
but your temper is a disaster, too.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.580
Do you have any idea how much people
trash-talk you behind your back?

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.290
My darling wife.
Why bring my looks into it?

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.960
When people first saw Ja Kyung,
they suspected a birth secret.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.830
She was just too pretty
to be your daughter.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.260
You're so dramatic.
And you think she looks like you?

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.570
At least get your facts straight.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.170
When Ja Kyung was in that kid's contest,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.470
everyone said
she must've been switched at birth...

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.340
because she didn't look a thing
like her mom.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.910
What do you mean she doesn't look like me?

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.240
People always say
we're just like carp-shaped buns.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.310
What's wrong with you?

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.550
Sure, carp-shaped buns.
Except you don't have any filling.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.120
First daughters always take
after their dads.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.050
It's a universal law of nature.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.290
Everyone says she's my spitting image.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.590
Spitting image, my foot.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.920
Fine, you want to get a paternity test
for the three of us?

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.990
Now you're talking.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.290
Let's do the test now and see
who she's the spitting image of.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.300
Bring it on.
The whole world knows I gave birth to her.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.100
For Pete's sake.
The watermill that night is my witness.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.040
Yang Mal Sook at the watermill?

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.340
"If you don't marry me, Pan Sool,
I'll become a nun!"

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.240
The full moon that night saw everything.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.150
That's hilarious.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.550
You were desperately clinging to me,
holding onto my skirt!

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.480
Your skirt? In your dreams.
You were wearing pants that day.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.690
Enough! Let's get the paternity test
for the three of us!

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.890
Fine!

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.270
I thought she was my granddaughter,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.000
but in reality, she's the enemy
who caused my granddaughter's death?

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.370
In a situation like this,

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.410
what am I supposed to do?

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.720
Why are you here again, Grandma?

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.220
Are there no cafes in your neighborhood?

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.620
I actually liked hearing
you call me Grandma.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.790
I thought you said you hated it.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.330
I did.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.760
But somewhere along the way,
I grew to like it.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.400
Maybe I liked it even more
because it came from you.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.770
In that case, I'll say it more often,
Grandma.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.670
Why are you wasting time here?

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.370
Are you that scared of your stepmom?

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.280
Does she hit you or something
if you don't do as you're told?

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.880
It's not like that...

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.480
It's just that I can sort my thoughts out
better here than at home.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.420
What is there that needs
so much sorting out?

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.260
What kind of person I am,

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.290
or if I've ever caused anyone
to get hurt...

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.400
Things like that.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.130
Has someone been hurt...

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.900
because of you?

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.310
That's something...

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.240
Why are you asking that?

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.980
I haven't even told my own mom
about this yet.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.910
If it's that difficult to talk about,

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.850
why do you even think about it?

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.750
It's because...

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.790
my mom told me to reflect on
whether I've hurt anyone...

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.390
or been mean to them,

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.290
so that's what I'm doing.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.860
Your stepmom told you that?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.900
Yes. Why?

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.500
Sit down if you're having coffee.
Otherwise, go.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.420
Hey.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.990
Did you know that
Kyung Chae and Sun Jae broke up?

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.860
What are you talking about?
Why? What happened?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.870
It looks like that brat Sun Jae defied
one of Kyung Chae's orders.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.840
So now Kyung Chae is livid
and making a huge scene about firing him.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.870
- That doesn't sound like Lawyer Kim.
- I know.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.840
Then again, Sun Jae did put up with her
for a long time.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.610
You know how she terrorizes
the people who work for her.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.350
So what's Lawyer Kim going to do now?

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.850
Who knows? According to Kyung Chae,
he even took off his engagement ring.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.840
Are you really planning to break off
your engagement with my sister?

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.610
I heard you took off your engagement ring.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.310
News travels fast.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.810
It looks like this is the end
of the road for us.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.150
I struggled just to get us engaged,

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.750
but anything beyond that...

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.950
Then you can go beyond that with me.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.990
What did you just say?

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.490
Let's give it a try. You and me.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.990
Whatever it is.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.760
Right now, you can't side with my sister,

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.100
and you can't side with Lucia either,
right?

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.370
So what's there to think about?

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.040
Team up with me,
and we'll take them both down.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.510
But I was with your sister. How could I...

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.110
You think that matters?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.540
I know my sister better than anyone.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.410
You two were engaged,

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.280
but I bet your relationship
wasn't physical, was it?

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.980
Am I wrong?

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.260
My shares, plus your nominee shares.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.400
If we pretend to support them
with the shares, only to backstab them,

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.660
don't you think it could be a lot of fun?

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.600
Don't you realize that could get us both
kicked out of Mingang for good?

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.970
Kyung Chae is already trying to figure out
how to get rid of you anyway.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.680
Isn't it better to strike first
than to wait to be fired?

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.120
Kim Sun Jae has been
deliberately acting out,

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.020
and now he's finally
showing his true colors.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.190
Really?

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.560
We've already set a date
for the shareholders' meeting,

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.490
but now that he's digging in his heels,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.360
I'm worried things
are going to fall apart.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.660
But you have your shares,

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.970
and Ji Seop and Ja Kyung
promised to give you theirs.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.170
So shouldn't that be enough?

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.740
There's more to it than that.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.310
I know he's my brother, but he changes
his mind at the drop of a hat.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.410
You never know
what unexpected problems might come up.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.880
You need to hurry
and transfer your stake to me.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.080
You need to make your move.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.680
Look. Our plan to make Father
and Lucia get a divorce...

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.150
ended up falling through.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.560
You have to be the one
to step up and take charge.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.620
That way, Se Ri can become the head
of Mingang that much sooner.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.530
Se Ri as the head of Mingang?

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.730
Of course.
That's what you want, isn't it?

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:36.770
And I...

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.240
will make sure that happens for you.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.010
On another note,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.410
I have to ask you something,
and I want you to be completely honest.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.580
Of course.
I'm always honest with you.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.350
Four years ago,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.590
there was a fatal accident on the rooftop
of Mingang Distribution, wasn't there?

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.820
To my understanding,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.990
a girl back then, around Se Ri's age,

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.630
jumped to her death.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.730
That? It was nothing.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.700
Someone died, and it was nothing?

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.700
She was a very troubled girl.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.140
It sounds harsh, but she had it coming.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.370
Her mother was a single mom,

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:18.580
and she couldn't even
name the biological father.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.110
They were never on our level
to begin with.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.880
She got tangled up with Se Ri,
and we got dragged into it.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.250
When I think about her mom showing up...

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.150
and making a scene
at the new business launch ceremony,

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.790
I still cringe.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.390
And that's not all.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.530
She'd come by and make a scene,
saying she'd clear her daughter's name.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.670
Doing that wasn't going to bring
her kid back to life.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.040
No wonder the father wants nothing to do
with any of it.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:48.910
It's obvious, isn't it?

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.910
He must be some good-for-nothing bum
she met somewhere.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.880
And with a father like that,
what do you expect from the child?

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.050
Mother.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.220
Don't you dare call me "Mother."
Get out now!

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.130
Get out of my sight!

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.960
(Mingang Distribution)

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.140
What is going on?

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.640
She was acting like
she'd give me the world.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.480
What does she expect me to do now?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.380
I'm already annoyed to death as it is.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.420
Come to my office.
There's something you have to know.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.310
What do you two think you're doing?

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.480
You and Lawyer Kim basically broke off
your engagement, right?

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.610
He took his engagement ring off himself,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.850
and you knew and went along with it.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.620
That means the engagement is off, right?

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.620
What did you just say?

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:13.060
She said a hound
after hunting season is over...

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.530
is just waiting to be put down.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.160
He told me what you said. That was harsh.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.400
I know using people and tossing them aside
is your specialty, but still.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.600
So what, you two are going
to get together now?

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.410
We're going to start
seeing each other seriously.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.080
You're insane.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.680
Careful with your words.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.680
Is there a law that says we can't date?

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.950
Look, we may have had
an engagement ceremony,

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.050
but we never even held hands.
What's the problem?

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.660
What is wrong with you?

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.190
Are you out of your mind?
Snap out of it!

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.460
We're perfectly fine.
You're the one who needs to get a grip.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.300
- My future sister-in-law.
- What? Sister-in-law?

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.040
Lawyer Kim, are you really doing this?

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.800
You're the one who's overreacting.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.440
You don't want him, but you can't stand
to see someone else? Is that it?

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.680
Is this how you're going
to stab me in the back?

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.610
Especially with the shareholders' meeting
coming up.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.710
You shouldn't have backstabbed me first.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.880
Since it has come to this,

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.990
would you mind leaving, my sister-in-law?

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.660
Unless you plan on standing there
to watch us kiss.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.890
It might be a little inappropriate
for the office,

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.830
but we're just so hot for each other.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.310
(Mingang Distribution)

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.490
Jang Yeon Sook turning on me
wasn't enough, and now them!

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.390
Did you all plan this?

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.820
Do you all want to see me go insane?

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.990
Why is everyone doing this to me?

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.840
This is the revised new business proposal
from before.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.740
Hey, what's wrong with you?

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.780
Here she goes again.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.720
What was the urgent matter?

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.130
Mother knows everything.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.770
Lawyer Kim Sun Jae
paid her a visit recently.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.370
You mean she knows about Se Ri and Mi So?

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.940
Also, Chairman Min Doo Sik...

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.440
is in the VIP Room
at Hanmyeong Hospital right now.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.180
He's regained consciousness,
and his motor functions have returned.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.050
He can communicate as well, of course.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.320
It wasn't easy betraying Mother.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.390
I know it's the right thing to do,
but stabbing her in the back like that...

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:03.760
I understand completely.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.460
That's why I never intended
to pressure you.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.230
But if I hesitated any longer,

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.470
I was afraid something irreversible
would happen.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.510
I was afraid...

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.940
she might murder Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.310
Murder? What do you mean?

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.150
Right now, there's nothing
she won't do for Ho Se.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.370
She's probably heading to the rooftop.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.480
Why there?

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.050
Madam Jang knows that
Mi So and Se Ri were switched.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.780
Apparently, Kim Sun Jae went to her
and told her everything.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.930
My Mi So...

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.430
My Mi So...

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.830
How?

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.440
How could she, so frail,
in a place like this?

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.870
Please, forgive her.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.840
What Se Ri did...

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.380
is unforgivable,

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.610
but please, just this once,

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.950
forgive her.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.790
I'll make sure she's punished
and turns over a new leaf.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.560
I'll make her understand
the terrible thing she's done.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.930
And...

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:17.690
I'll make her spend her entire life...

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.630
atoning for what she did to Mi So.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:22.830
And what good will that do?

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.300
That won't bring a dead child
back to life.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.840
What I can't stand is...

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.880
why, of all things,
those two had to be the ones switched.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.280
Why? Just tell me why!

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.050
Why did they have to be switched...

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.920
for your daughter to kill my grandchild?

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.180
Just why?

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:44.920
Before Mi So...

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.090
was your granddaughter,

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.930
she was my daughter.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.000
You know how much she meant to me.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.770
Others may not understand,

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.140
but you, of all people, know.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.340
You're Mi So's...

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.310
grandmother, after all.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.150
I won't let Mi So's death...

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.820
be in vain.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.730
When Mi So...

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.130
was in that incubator,
hovering between life and death,

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.010
I was told countless times
she might not make it through the night.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.610
But Mi So...

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.480
pulled through every single time.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.850
And growing up,

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.620
she was a sweet daughter
who never gave me a moment's worry.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.460
No matter what anyone says,

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.930
Mi So is my daughter.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.200
Even now, just thinking about Mi So,

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.540
it hurts so much right here
that I can't even breathe.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.950
So how can it be...

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.220
that Mi So isn't my daughter?

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:23.220
I failed her.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.360
I'm the one who couldn't protect Mi So.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.760
So, please, just blame me.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.430
Mi So wouldn't want...

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.070
to see her grandmother fall apart...

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.270
because of her, either.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.210
I'll decide what to do with you later.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.710
First, I have to punish the one
who truly deserves it.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.510
Die! Just die!

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.910
Die!

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.480
Die!

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.610
Just die!

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.550
Die!

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.180
Die!

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.520
Die...

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.690
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.310
You're breaking up with me this way?

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.280
You're stabbing me in the back
to be with Soo Jung?

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.780
If that doesn't work,
then we'll have to play our final card.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:32.180
Your final card?

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.680
If you want to protect Mingang,
do it on your own.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.120
From now on, try to be a decent person.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.520
Don't tell me you're packing everything up
and skipping the country.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.330
Hurry and stop them
before this whole thing blows up.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.530
I might be leaving,

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.030
but not without what I deserve
for my loyalty to Mingang.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
