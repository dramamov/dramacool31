00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.360
What are you doing?

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.960
I'm not doing anything.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.680
I just listened to Hui Ge.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.320
Suddenly, I feel eager to study.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360
In theory,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.840
time reversal is impossible.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.640
It's like what we eat

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.000
can't be restored to its original state.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.840
But what if this theory fails?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.600
Time in a moving inertial frame

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.120
runs slower than in a stationary inertial frame.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.480
That's relativity.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.920
In relativity,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.720
time travel is possible.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.960
But how do you explain the grandfather paradox?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.320
If you go back and kill your great-grandfather,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.600
would you succeed?

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.040
Even if you did,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.400
you wouldn't be born at all.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.040
So you couldn't go back and kill him.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.240
You know, Yu Xingchen,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.440
I like being challenged.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.800
Not bad.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.640
It's because of the grandfather paradox

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.960
that scientists are studying parallel world theory.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.280
Parallel world.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.200
So I'm really in a parallel world now.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.200
Simply put, the you in a parallel world is you,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.440
but also not you.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.560
Different choices create different versions of you.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.720
In senior year,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.080
Zhang Jie gave me a love letter.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.560
She said it was for Hui Ge.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.120
Zhang Jie liked Hui Ge.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.080
Come on.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.840
What?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.000
Get closer to Hui Ge.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.200
You'll learn more.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.640
What do you mean?

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.080
Didn't expect you, Yu Xingchen, to be a like-minded person.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.040
Yu Xingchen.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.520
You seem to know a lot about physics.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.400
Yu Xingchen, your physics test.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.000
You passed after just two tries.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.200
With your score,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.680
forget time travel for now.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.360
Focus on the college entrance exam first.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.680
I'm not a researcher.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.280
I just accidentally became a participant.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.560
Well said.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.000
In the tide of the cosmic era,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.560
we are all participants.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.160
Rare that you can keep up with my wavelength.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.800
Ask me anytime if you have questions.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.400
Won't I bother you?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.040
Your time is so precious.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.480
On a cosmic scale,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.320
each person's time

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.400
is just insignificant dust.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.080
My score this time is just too outrageous.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.040
My science grades weren't this bad before.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.000
It's senior year.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.600
Grades go up and down, that's normal.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.760
Don't be upset.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.000
Thanks.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.480
If you don't get a question, I'll teach you.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.120
I get it.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.000
Let's start from question one.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.600
As shown in the diagram,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.800
an object

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.960
slides down a fixed inclined plane.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.000
Honestly, I'm not sure myself.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.280
My silence

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.080
is it because high school was so long ago

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.280
and I've forgotten the answers,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.720
Or is there more?

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.640
You can also do it this way.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.080
In this situation,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.600
make an angle.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.080
Or is it Su Ruo's smile

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.720
that's already the answer to everything?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.400
Yu Xingchen.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.000
I need a favor from you.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.920
You two talk.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.160
Yu Xingchen.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.800
Ask me anytime if you don't understand.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.320
Okay.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.920
Let me guess.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.280
It's for Hui Ge, right?

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.440
Yeah.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.120
Can I give it to Hui Ge?

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.040
Don't worry.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.040
I'll hand him the letter myself this time.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.320
I definitely won't lose it.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.640
But be prepared,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.440
he might not like your type.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.880
Just show it to him.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.520
I'll wait for your answer.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.400
Um, Yu Xingchen,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.560
I know.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.480
That time travel topic earlier

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.920
made you feel like we're kindred spirits.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.480
But since it's senior year,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.280
let's just stay classmates.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.880
Is that okay with you?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.880
It's not me.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.040
A girl gave it to you.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.000
Was it Su Ruo?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.800
No, it wasn't.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.320
Don't just stand there.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.400
Open it and see.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.400
This is the first time in my life

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.960
I've received a love letter.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.200
Maybe you should read it instead.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.000
That's not really appropriate.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.000
I'm a bit allergic to the perfume on it.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.840
Hey.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.200
You, secretly in love with Su Ruo,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.520
must be reading the letter right now.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.400
I wouldn't call it liking.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.360
It's just a bit of attention, that's all.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.320
From what I know about you,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.920
you process things really fast.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.560
Yes.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.240
I do read things quickly.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.240
Can you stop responding so half-heartedly?

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.440
Let me finish reading.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.280
That day at Su Ruo's house,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.240
I accidentally looked through her drawer.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.640
It was truly by accident.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.920
I couldn't help but think,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.040
Beautiful people really do have youth.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.280
Tell me,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.560
was there a love letter from you to her?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.560
I'd never do something like write a love letter.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.800
Whether there was or not,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.880
your heart belongs to her anyway.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.040
Right?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.280
There's no place for me in that.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760
Strange.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.240
I wasn't always watching Su Ruo.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.920
I always seem witty in front of you,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.720
like I'm really smart.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.240
But you don't know,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.600
as your deskmate—

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.480
Turns out I was your deskmate.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.000
I put all my effort into

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.320
finding every excuse I could,

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.040
just hoping you'd notice me more.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.760
To be someone a bit different in your eyes.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.480
But Yu Xingchen,

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.880
now you understand everything, right?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.160
Hui Ge said

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.920
he doesn't like you.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.400
He read my letter.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.480
He did.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.200
Zhang Jie.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.200
All these years, I've wanted to apologize to you.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.760
Actually, Hui Ge never replied back then.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.880
I was the one who lost the letter.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.920
I know.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.840
Back then, you only had Su Ruo in your heart.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.080
I understand.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.760
If I could do it over,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.680
I would never lie to you.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.880
I'd make sure to give the letter to Hui Ge.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.240
Please apologize to Hui Ge for me.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.920
I shouldn't have used his name

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.400
to send you that letter.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.640
So it was meant for me.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.480
No wonder she was so angry back then.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.200
Zhang Jie.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.440
Zhang Jie.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.160
I read your letter.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.200
I read it very carefully.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.440
I really did.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.720
All these years,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.160
it's the first time I've received something so sincere.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.680
You're not that old either.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.080
Anyway,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.800
thank you.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.400
Su Ruo.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.080
Su Ruo.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.760
I'm heading the same way.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.960
Let me walk you home.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.480
No need, I'm already home.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.440
It's fine.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.000
I'm going that way too.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.840
Your shoelace is untied.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.400
Let me tie it for you.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.840
No, I can do it myself.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.400
My dad told me

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.120
a reliable man

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.120
should know how to tie a girl's shoelaces.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.240
You said thank you just now—

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.160
what did you mean?

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.240
Thank you for your letter.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.120
It answered a question I've had for a long time.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.840
Just...

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.720
Is "thank you" all?

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.080
Zhang Jie.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.560
Sorry.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.280
Honestly, I expected this long ago.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.080
After all, you like Su Ruo.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.440
Sometimes I feel

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.480
you're not quite like I imagined.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.040
I thought it wouldn't end like this.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.560
What do you mean?

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.520
From what I know about you,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.800
you're not good at turning people down.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.360
Maybe after reading my passionate letter,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.400
you'd agree without thinking.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.760
And we'd end up together just like that.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.480
Who knows.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.160
Didn't expect you to refuse so directly.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.400
So silly.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.880
I think you're really brave.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.560
If you like someone, just say it.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.240
When I was your age,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.560
I didn't have your courage.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.440
Looking back, I regret it.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.080
At my age now,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.400
I'm leaving.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.200
Su Ruo.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.160
No need to walk me home.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.360
It's not raining today.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.920
So you mean,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.200
I can walk you home if it rains?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.560
That's not what I meant.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.520
I think she might like you.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.160
Just a guess.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.600
My intuition is usually right.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.600
Maybe after the college entrance exam,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.080
you could give it a try.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.920
She really is outstanding.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.440
But I already like someone.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.120
By the way,

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.880
about what you said earlier—

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.920
the person you like,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.200
do I know them?

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.120
You're smiling so happily.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.000
You must really like them.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.000
Yu Xingchen.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.200
Come out.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.920
Wait for me at the door.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.280
Tell me,

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.640
why did you come to someone else's home?

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.720
Who are you, really?

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.880
Yu Xingchen, let go!

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.720
He's Zhang Chuan from downstairs.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.600
We all know about his situation here.
