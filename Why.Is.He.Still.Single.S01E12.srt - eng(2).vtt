Here you go.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.180
I promised I'd make you noodles.

00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:17.390
You're such a good friend.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.460
Let me smell it.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.350
It's great.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.740
You're amazing, Xiaoman.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.270
I have to praise your cooking.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.790
This is one of the reasons

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.550
I love coming to your place.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.990
I can't wait to try it.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.510
Delicious.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.700
Wait.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.830
Shouldn't you

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.990
give Mr. Yu a bowl of noodles too?

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.440
Well, you see.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.300
I could put up a longevity plaque
for him at the temple,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.350
but asking me to treat him to a meal...

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.190
I get it.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.790
Mr. Yu-phobia.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.830
We're both patients.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.420
Say, Xiaoman,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.510
are you free this weekend?

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.110
Can you come to a matchmaking event
with me?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.550
Why again?

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.110
My dad and I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.990
made a deal.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.860
If I attend this matchmaking event,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.230
I get two months of peace.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.670
I really don't want to go.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.790
Is Mr. Yu doing aerobics?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.020
Mr. Yu?

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.740
Doing aerobics?

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.390
Ouch.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.350
Ow.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.420
My back.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.510
Please come in.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.690
What happened?

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.630
It hurts.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.670
Where?

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.950
The ab roller.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.060
I did nine reps.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.860
Just nine reps
and you're in this much pain?

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.070
Each rep

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.660
was very solid.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.530
That's why

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.751
my whole body is sore now.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.700
Does this hurt?

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:51.306
- Does this hurt?
- What are you doing?

00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:52.684
Is this how you treat the elders?

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.990
Since when are you my elder?

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.350
I call your dad "Fourth Brother",

00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:57.130
so you should call me "Sixth Uncle",
got it?

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.300
Oh, Sixth Uncle.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.500
You're in so much pain.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.670
Should I bring you

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.230
a wheelchair?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.500
The exam's done.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.030
You over-exercised
and your muscles are sore.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.595
Rest for two days, and you'll be fine.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.150
Exercise is for your health.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.351
Why punish your body like this?

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.150
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.500
Why suddenly do ab-roller training?

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.500
Because I want abs.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.030
Mr. Yu, even without abs,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.620
you're still a very charming man.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.460
Oh?

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.660
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.940
My dad signed me up
for a matchmaking event.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.500
He keeps saying no one likes me,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.180
so I want to prove my charm.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.090
Do you want to join me
and test yours as well?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.420
We can make a bet.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.260
Hmph!

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.260
You really love betting.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
Let's see if anyone wants to
go on a date with you

00:05:43.262 --> 00:05:44.590
after the event.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.380
What? Scared?

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.430
Says who?

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.590
Time. Place.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.980
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.940
Wu.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.780
Yes?

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.790
If I had abs,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.260
would you look?

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.390
What?

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.990
Forget it.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.260
I'm not showing you.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.830
Wu.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.690
Yeah.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.550
Why are you staring at him
like you're seeing something gross?

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.150
Mr. Wu asked me to feel his abs.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.940
You have abs?

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.910
Don't touch me.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.590
Oh, please.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.030
All my personal trainers
are better than you.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.790
Hmph! Listen.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.710
Even without abs,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.230
I'm still very charming.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.060
What did you buy this time?

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.870
Beauty.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.710
Let me formally introduce her.

She won an Oscar

for "Gone with the Wind".

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.750
You know her?

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.350
This poster

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.260
is from "A Streetcar Named Desire".

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.620
1951. First premier. First edition.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.670
This is her autograph.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.390
How much?

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.340
Shallow.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.220

Come. Give me a hug, my baby.

Dad, look.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.110
This is the matchmaking event.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.500
Pretty impressive, right?

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.300
I've hit this month's quota.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.150

wait till next month.

Wait.

- Oh.
- Thank you.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.910
We should celebrate this. Cheers.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.260
Do you think Mr. Yu will come?

Show your hip joint.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.190
Hip?

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.310
I'm warning you.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.830
Have some confidence.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.830
Don't go this far just to win.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.270
See that?

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.470
Calm face

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.470
with the raging storm inside.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.990
That's her trait, not a flaw.

00:10:02.173 --> 00:10:03.660
It means she comports herself well

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.500
and is forgiving.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.190
Besides, she never holds a grudge.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.110
She's a care-free type.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.590
Something happens, and she forgets.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.140
Is he your ex-husband?

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.500
Yes, he is.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.710
Nice looks,

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.780
but average performances.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.500
I'll let you guys talk.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.430
I'm going to the restroom.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.950
Well.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.590
What a shame.
He's not interested in you.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.860
Why are you messing this up?

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.700
Wait.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.140
I was praising you.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.140
I was promoting you.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.900
No need. Worry about yourself.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.990
Stop interfering.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.190
Annoying. You're going to lose for sure.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.950
Take your nonsense elsewhere.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.990
This is called,
"I shot myself in the foot."

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.140
Up there. Isn't that Mr. Yu?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.470
He's in the one-on-one area.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.020
Doesn't matter where he is.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.710
No one can stand listening to him.

00:11:18.617 --> 00:11:20.462
He gets three seconds
of sympathy from me.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.950
Jia,

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.380
I love your dimples.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.470
I'm so jealous.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.900
I want to get surgery for one.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.070
Don't.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.540
They'd collect rainwater.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.710
You're sounding more like Mr. Yu.

00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:37.740
You're starting to act like him.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.070
Am I?

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:00.990
Look.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.190
There are two of them.

00:12:04.106 --> 00:12:05.620
They can't handle him for long.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.860
Aren't you two cramped?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.660
This is a competition.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.020
This is a rat race.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.260
You're fighting for mate-choice rights.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.070
The rights go to you.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.950
One's gone.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.660
Right, we weren't done talking.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.660
There's also a related term for that,
priority mate-choice rights.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.230
You're not that knowledgeable.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.710
The other one left too.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.860
I told you.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.110
We'll definitely win.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:40.430
Right.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.430
Nikon FM2.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.230
Oh, you know cameras.

00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:36.310
People don't carry cash anymore.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.710
Can't believe someone brought coins.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:39.310
Thank you.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.590
Hey. If you keep shooting me,
I'm charging for image rights.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.110
My job is to photograph the event,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.470
but I respect your privacy.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.573
But this is a film. I can't delete them.

00:13:54.617 --> 00:13:56.070
And I shot other things at the start,

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.660
so I can't give you the whole roll.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.500
So?

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:02.540
So, I'll develop the negatives
and send them to you.

00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:04.860
Keep or throw them away, your choice.
How does that sound?

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:07.540
Whatever.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.262
But I don't think
you'll throw them away.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:11.910
What do you think?

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.173
Develop the negatives
and give them to me.

00:14:16.173 --> 00:14:16.840
Okay.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.190
What's your name?

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.580
Yu Yu.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.500
Yu Yu?

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.430
Mmm.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.310
No wonder you looked familiar.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.020
I've seen you in home decor magazines.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.350
You must be the talented

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.710
but quirky designer, right?

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.310
Am I weird?

00:14:31.595 --> 00:14:32.995
Nice to meet you, I'm Fei Wenli.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.270
What?

00:14:35.662 --> 00:14:37.351
(Fei Wenli. Events Department)
Fei Wenli.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:43.950
I didn't expect to meet you here.

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:46.373
Are you here for the matchmaking event?

00:14:46.484 --> 00:14:47.620
I'm here for a competition.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.860
And I'm about to win.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.420
Congrats.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.500
I remember your design concept
centers on the kitchen.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.660
- Right?
- Right.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.470
People say a bed makes a home,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.500
but it doesn't.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.500
The warmth of cooking does.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.620
Mmm.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.230
To be precise, it's wok hei.
[*Charred, smoky flavor from stir-frying]

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:08.790
Wok hei?

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.660
You know about food?

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.110
Of course. All I do every day
is take photos and eat.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.380
I love meat,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.660
especially braised pork belly.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.380
Braised pork belly?

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:20.860
Yeah. Do you like it?

00:15:23.084 --> 00:15:24.310
I used to eat it all the time.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.700
I see.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.190
Jia, I can't find Mr. Yu.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.990
Could someone have picked him up?

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.430
Impossible.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.470
He's immune to flirting.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.830
Maybe he ran off
because he felt defeated.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.110
Let him.

00:15:39.128 --> 00:15:41.050
I've struck out on
seven conversations in a row.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.470
It's like I've collected
every kind of superhero here.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.190
The matchmaking event

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.190
is seriously training
my stress tolerance.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.780
Yeah. Like you said,

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.860
someone funny, attractive,
and easy to talk to

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.070
can't be found here.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.100
Honestly,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.590
everyone here is less interesting
than Mr. Yu.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.020
Keep looking for him then.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.540
Sure. I'll look for something fun.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.660
Isn't that Mr. Yu?

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.710
They're chatting and laughing.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.900
She's a young, pretty lady.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.070
That makes no sense.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.430
Look.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.380
Is that a staff ID

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.070
hanging around her neck?

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.660
Mr. Yu is doing whatever it takes

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.830
to win.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.840
Hmph.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.860
Such a pity.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.190
He scared off all the ladies,

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.230
so now he can only talk to the staff.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.595
Blanch the pork belly.

00:16:34.617 --> 00:16:37.950
Then, turn it to medium heat and simmer
for two minutes and fifteen seconds.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.590
Yes, to get rid of the blood smell.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.780
Then, cut it into pieces,

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.500
and fry it until half-cooked.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:44.590
Golden brown.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.190
Add ginger and scallions.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.990
Yes. Then add rock sugar and stir slowly.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.310
After adding water,

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.310
throw in some star anise and cinnamon.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.020
Hey, not "throw".

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.500
You need the exact grams.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.350
Fine. Skip ahead to lifting the lid

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.590
and serving it at the table.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.430
Glossy and red.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.590
Nice aroma.

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.340
You're making me hungry.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.230
Come on. Let's eat now.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:10.550
Now?

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.630
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.710
Whoa. Have you found someone
who wants to marry you?

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.860
Need my help?

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:22.920
We had a good conversation.

00:17:22.928 --> 00:17:23.740
No thanks.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:24.750
Really?

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.550
Ximen.

00:17:29.484 --> 00:17:30.540
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:31.870
Let's continue.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:32.940
Let's go.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:33.940
Xiaoman.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.620
Your friends?

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:40.910
My neighbor and my doctor.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.710
Ignore them. Let's go.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.580
Okay.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.780
I'll take you to a place

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.100
you've definitely never tried.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.100
Really?

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.060
He's despicable.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.630
He went after the staff.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.670
He really wants to win.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.710
(Yu Yu)
(I won.)

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.740
May I ask, which one of you
is supposed to talk to me?

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.100
- Her.
- Her.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.190
Let me try.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.310
How does it taste?

00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:25.973
The braised pork belly is really good.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.870
Right? I've eaten it since I was a kid.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.740
Even after I became a photographer,

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.260
I came back to shoot the chef here.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.430
An old Shanghai man.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.580
Not bad.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.060
You captured
that warmth of cooking I like.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.340
Well, your photos are artistic,

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.740
but they still feel real.

00:18:44.928 --> 00:18:46.780
That's what a good photographer
should do.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.060
Thank you.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.260
A bad one is that they close their eyes,
hit the shutter,

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.150
and call it "art".

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.300
I know people like that.

00:18:56.328 --> 00:18:57.540
What do you usually shoot?

00:18:59.020 --> 00:18:59.910
Beauty.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.820
I don't want to shoot Messi
being tackled mid-air,

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.150
or homeless refugees.

00:19:06.484 --> 00:19:08.284
I just like shooting things
that are beautiful.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.430
But those photos don't get paid,

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.340
so I can only take gigs

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.820
like the matchmaking event earlier

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.020
to fund my dream.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.710
Keep at it.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.270
I support you.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.020
Take photos that make people feel calm

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.950
when they're upset

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.670
or hopeful when they're down.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:31.750
Alright.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.380
Thank you.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.500
An optimistic photographer spreads joy.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.910
A kind designer creates happiness.

00:19:49.484 --> 00:19:50.580
I have to get back to work.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.150
Annoying. Bill, please.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:53.710
Wait.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.710
Guess how many photos I took.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:56.950
Even or odd?

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.470
I think

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.990
even.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.060
Wrong. 35 photos.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:05.900
It's on me.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.180
Thank you.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.790
Nice meeting you.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.070
- Is it here?
- Yes.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:30.940
Give me a second.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.620
Again?

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.910
I really can't wait to see them.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.630
Really? I'll do it quick.

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:47.540
Thank you for sending me back.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.395
Don't mention it.
Next time it's your turn.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:04.470
Next time?

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.820
(Espresso)

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.150
Mr. Yu, sorry to call you back

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.820
on the weekend.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.320
It's fine.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.230
Wow.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.430
Did you go to an audition or something?

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.190
Just cleaned myself up a bit.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.990
Why do you sound like Ou Yang?

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.470
Well,

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.060
Sun said the schedules are overlapping.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.060
They're short-handed.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.528
Figure something out.
Xiaoxiao went to get the documents.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.860
She'll bring them over in a moment.

00:21:46.862 --> 00:21:48.390
Mr. Yu.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:50.550
The files.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.740
(Slackers Group Chat)

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.180
What?

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.340
What's it?

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.190
Xiaoxiao stepped on my foot.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.940
(Who's that woman?)

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.100
(Mr. Yu's girlfriend?)

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.170
(It's that photographer
from the matchmaking event.)

00:22:32.173 --> 00:22:34.860
(Are they dating now?)

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:39.550
Let's take a selfie.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:41.870
The lighting's bad here.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:42.820
Let's move to this side.

00:22:44.195 --> 00:22:46.020
You look pretty from this angle,
Xiaoxiao.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:47.230
Really pretty.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.540
It's working hours now.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:54.150
- Alright.
- Alright.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.580
(Something's wrong with him.)

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.710
Mr. Yu,

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.500
who was that girl just now?

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.550
A girl?

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.780
No wonder you clean up so nicely.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.470
She's young and beautiful.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.950
She dropped him off.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:32.790
Really?

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.940
Who is she?

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.620
No one.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.540
No one? She's gorgeous.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:40.860
Look at him.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.430
He's trying to hide it.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.100
Are you shy?

00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:49.300
You really got yourself a girlfriend?

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.670
Someone actually asked you out, Mr. Yu?

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.100
Am I not allowed to go on a date?

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.540
Why are you all freaking out?

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.620
What do you think?

00:24:04.662 --> 00:24:06.770
I just like shooting something
that is beautiful.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:08.340
Hello, I'm Fei Wenli.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.500
- Wu.
- Yes?

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.540
Take that poster down
and throw it away.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.940
Why?

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:20.990
That one isn't the real Yu Yu.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:44.300
Do you need a straw?

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.310
No.

00:24:45.773 --> 00:24:47.100
Do you have a membership card?

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:48.310
No.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.580
By the way,

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.470
this one's on me.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.100
Thank you.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.630
We can make a bet.

00:25:03.662 --> 00:25:05.640
Let's see if anyone wants to
go on a date with you

00:25:05.684 --> 00:25:06.710
after the event.

00:25:06.773 --> 00:25:07.780
You're definitely losing.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.500
Who was that girl just now?

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:11.790
Who is she?

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.580
No wonder you clean up so nicely.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.070
Oh.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.060
What are you doing here, Dao?

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.990
Look what I brought you.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.660
Dao.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.580
Mr. Yu.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.500
What are you eating, Dao?

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.470
He says it's nothing.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.150
Um... Mr. Yu.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:48.630
That girl from the matchmaking event...

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.580
Her name is Fei Wenli.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.070
Right.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.670
How are things going with her?

00:25:53.684 --> 00:25:55.173
Have you two had a meal together yet?

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.270
We have.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.180
How was it?

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.180
The food is good.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.740
I mean, how are things between you two?

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.860
Not bad.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.630
What did you two do?

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.670
We ate, took a walk,

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.100
took a car,

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:10.940
and took some photos.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.060
Wow, so romantic.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.580
Romantic what?

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.060
I didn't even get her number.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.300
So "not bad"

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.060
means "not okay".

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.340
Liar.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:27.750
Wait...

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.630
Why is she here?

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.990
Mr. Yu.

00:26:41.462 --> 00:26:42.710
How did you know I live here?

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.950
I'm staff.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.060
I have your info.

00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:46.340
We chatted for two hours,

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.928
and I didn't add you on WeChat.

00:26:48.017 --> 00:26:49.540
We talked for two hours?

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.560
Yeah. Here you go.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.020
Looking forward to it?

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.660
(Podfelin Laboratory)
Check and see if it's clear.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.862
I'm looking forward to it.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.150
What's that?

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.351
It has nothing to do with you.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:01.490
Hi, neighbor.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.580
We met this morning.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.420
I'm Fei Wenli.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.020
Hi, I'm Xia Xiaoman.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:07.310
This is my card.

00:27:07.395 --> 00:27:08.189
I'm a photographer.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.710
If you want a photo shoot,
just hit me up.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:10.910
Okay. Sure.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.430
Why are you coughing?

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.020
Don't you have things to do?

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:25.270
You guys talk.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.470
Tomorrow's the weekend.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.740
Come by my studio if you're free.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.870
I have a Flextight X5 scanner.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.300
All the chemicals are single-use,

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.340
including E6.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:37.750
Interested?

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.630
Very interested.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.100
The anticipation of film

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.680
is something digital can't compare to.

00:27:42.684 --> 00:27:44.150
Here. Add me on WeChat, and I'm off.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:45.373
See you at my studio tomorrow.

00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:46.070
Alright.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.140
Coming.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.190
Welcome.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.470
Big news!

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:44.390
Mr. Yu is seeing someone.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.660
What?

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.340
That girl from the matchmaking event.
Fei Wenli.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.830
Oh.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:53.910
You know what?

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:55.190
The way they looked at each other

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.340
was pure chemistry.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.780
Oh, really?

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.500
"Oh"?

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.230
This is huge news. I need a moment.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.500
(Podfelin Laboratory, Fei Wenli)

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.510
Look.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.180
It's her, right?

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.262
(Photographer, Podfelin Laboratory)

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:13.950
She looks elegant.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.990
She's older than me,

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.580
but she's very artsy.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.060
Marriage is a dark path

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:20.900
full of thorns.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.060
Wish them luck.

00:29:22.084 --> 00:29:23.230
What are you talking about?

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.780
They're not getting married tomorrow.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:27.550
True.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.430
Are you upset
that Mr. Yu's dating someone?

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.470
Why would I be?

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.060
Well, I am.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.470
He's already dating,
and I'm still single.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.340
Makes me look like a loser.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.390
How about we go shopping tomorrow?

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:51.230
I need an outlet.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.230
Sure. Afternoon.

00:29:54.328 --> 00:29:55.906
I have consultations in the morning.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.430
Mr. Yu's dating someone.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.150
Ridiculous!

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.740
What is this?

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.990
You're so lazy now,
and you see a doctor by video?

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.420
Well...

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.870
I need you to help me pick an outfit.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.510
Look.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.100
Pick one for me.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.910
Which one works?

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.580
You really need me for this?

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.500
If you don't want to help,

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.790
it's fine.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:52.710
What's the occasion?

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.230
I'm meeting someone.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.030
Man or woman?

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.140
Woman.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.020
Fei Wenli?

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.740
Top right, first outfit.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.860
This one?

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:39.510
What are you doing?

00:31:39.795 --> 00:31:41.395
- Taking pictures of you.
- Delete it.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.020
Film can't be deleted.

00:31:43.951 --> 00:31:45.820
Aren't you going on a date?
Why are you here?

00:31:46.662 --> 00:31:47.780
I wanted to test the camera.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:48.750
I'm busy.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.100
I'll take just two shots.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.470
Why not shoot someone else?

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.870
Out of the people I know,
you're the only one I thought of.

00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:58.706
No one else wants to
deal with you, right?

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.300
You look best in photos.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.670
Don't move. No big movements.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.740
One, two, three.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:09.710
This one's nice.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.260
Look outside. Good.

00:32:11.728 --> 00:32:13.551
A few more shots. It won't take long.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.870
Big faces are easier to focus on.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.820
What did you just say? Say that again.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:29.220
(Podfelin Laboratory)

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.420
(Podfelin)

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:12.860
How's it?

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:19.620
Mr. Yu,

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:20.950
just relax and pose naturally.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.870
Try putting one foot down.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.580
Mr. Yu,

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.060
it isn't quite ideal today.

00:33:38.506 --> 00:33:40.373
Why don't we shoot at your studio
another day?

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.420
That's troublesome.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.820
You bought the premium portrait package.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.430
Of course, I want to capture
the most real, natural,

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.340
and handsome version of you, right?

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.100
You're right. I agree.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.340
Great. It's settled.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.340
(Podfelin)

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.350
How's my studio?

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.190
Not bad.

00:34:14.973 --> 00:34:16.620
I thought it'd be
some ordinary photo studio.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.020
I didn't know it was a film lab.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.195
For a moment, I thought
I had traveled back in time.

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.870
Photo studios are all over the place.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:23.310
This place

00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:24.750
is history.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:28.020
Oh, right. Can you develop this roll?

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.150
This is

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.100
a Seagull 4A.

00:34:34.417 --> 00:34:36.128
One of the two Chinese classic rolls.

00:34:36.506 --> 00:34:37.540
The other one's Phoenix.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:38.790
You're an expert.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.500
But this roll must be really old.

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:43.500
Hope it develops.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.350
It's a 400 roll, but I shot it at 100.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.750
So develop it at 800.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.310
Professional.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.860
No problem.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.750
Nice shot.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.420
Not bad.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.100
Can I do it myself?

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.020
Of course.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.310
Here.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.830
Remember.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:32.960
This is the developer.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.810
This is the wash.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:34.670
This is the fixer.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.540
Is she the doctor?

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.110
Yeah.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.020
Nice shot.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.670
Thank you.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.390
Please. Please.

00:36:42.351 --> 00:36:43.470
What are you doing, Xiaoxiao?

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.020
Tomorrow's Monday.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.262
I'm making a wish
that I don't have to wake up early.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.150
Stop dreaming.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.390
Unless the earth explodes.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.980
What are you thinking about?

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.060
I just think

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.350
that Fei Wenli is a bit weird.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.140
When we see Mr. Yu,

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.180
we don't like him.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.750
But when she sees him,

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.620
she's even more into him.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:09.910
What's wrong with that?

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.020
Maybe she sees
Mr. Yu as a potential client.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:14.950
When we meet a client,

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.470
we all do that sincere fake smile.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.310
A sincere fake smile?

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:23.270
It sounds twisted.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.580
That's normal.

00:37:24.684 --> 00:37:26.417
After all, she's trying
to get customers.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.500
Anyway,

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.540
if she really hits the right note,

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.270
Mr. Yu would definitely spend money.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.270
Yeah.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:42.710
What?

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.790
Mr. Yu says tomorrow's a day off.

00:37:44.884 --> 00:37:46.830
He told me to let you know
you don't need to go.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.060
I don't need to go?

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.620
My wish came true.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:51.990
But I have confirmed

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:53.660
tomorrow's work with him.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.540
Why suddenly cancel?

00:37:54.684 --> 00:37:56.417
And why don't you need to go to work?

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.830
You're not under him.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.950
Look. Ms. Lin just texted me.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.500
Mr. Yu told her not to go
to the studio tomorrow.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:11.580
What on earth

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.140
is Mr. Yu doing at the studio tomorrow?

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.390
I heard he's meeting Fei Wenli
this weekend.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.500
So maybe

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.310
your day off
has something to do with her.

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:23.830
I get it.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.700
Men always bring women to their turf

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.790
to show off their success.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:28.750
That's typical of men.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.660
He's probably meeting her
there tomorrow

00:38:31.706 --> 00:38:32.990
and doesn't want you guys around,

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.830
as it'll be awkward,

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.373
so he gave everyone the day off.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.580
Is he really dating now?

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:40.700
How would I know?

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.950
Whether he is or not,
we'll find out tomorrow.

00:38:45.262 --> 00:38:46.470
You can wake up early then?

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.620
Not even the food can shut you up.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.270
I want to see too.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.580
But we both have work tomorrow.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:53.950
You can go.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:55.151
I'll help you apply for leave.

00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:56.084
You go for me.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.180
I'm not interested.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.580
My task is very important.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:01.710
Give me another one.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.700
I want to have a boyfriend.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.540
Here.

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:14.630
Eat one.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.020
It's really good.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.020
Nice, right? Eat more.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:21.020
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.230
Good.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.830
Very good.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.310
Yes. Good.
Lower your head a little. Turn around.

00:39:32.506 --> 00:39:33.830
Taking photos is exhausting.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:34.910
You're good at this.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.470
People used to ask me
to model, you know?

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.420
I turned them down.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.340
Close-up shot.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:41.670
Good.

00:39:41.728 --> 00:39:42.710
Let me check the light.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:43.980
Mr. Yu,

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.180
your studio is so nice.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:47.590
I'm jealous.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:49.700
If a designer

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:52.060
who can't fix his own workspace,

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.430
how can clients trust them?

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.830
Fair point. Clothes make the man.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:56.900
House too.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:00.040
- Close-up shot.
- Okay.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.700
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.060
Hi, I'm Shen Wu.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.020
Nickname Wu.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.060
Hello, I'm Fei Wenli.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:09.150
No nickname.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.390
You're Fei Wenli?

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:14.580
I heard

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.750
you rescued Mr. Yu

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.100
from the matchmaking event

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.310
and saved thousands of girls
from his mean sarcasm.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.910
I thank you on their behalf.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.230
No need.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:23.560
- Wu.
- Yes?

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.020
Didn't I tell you not to come today?

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:25.860
Why are you here?

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.580
I forgot something.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.830
Carry on. Don't mind me.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.860
Let's continue.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.100
- Ignore him.
- Okay.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.390
Milk tea.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.480
Hi.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.340
Hi.

00:40:39.351 --> 00:40:40.430
What are you doing here?

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.270
I...

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:47.660
I thought you were working so hard,

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:48.795
so I came to check on you.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:50.620
Aren't you living with Wu?

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:51.990
He could've brought it.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.906
We're couples.
Either of us can deliver.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:54.750
Have something sweet?

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.420
No thanks.

00:40:57.484 --> 00:40:58.540
Just put it down and leave.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:02.990
Wu.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.830
Yes?

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:04.710
Have you found it?

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.180
Where is it? I can't find it.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.020
Xiaoxiao,

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.180
help me.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.950
Don't disturb Mr. Yu.

00:41:18.173 --> 00:41:19.560
- Let's change angles.
- Okay.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.020
- Ignore them.
- Okay.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:23.790
Come on.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.310
Let's get a few nice shots.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:26.940
Whoa.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:27.950
Ms. Lin.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.595
- Everyone's here?
- You're here, Ms. Lin.

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:31.350
Mr. Yu,

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:32.910
those eyes of yours.

00:41:33.595 --> 00:41:35.017
Missing your girlfriend?

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:40.980
Hi.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:43.790
Hello. Well...

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.830
I'm Fei Wenli.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.470
You really do know Vivien Leigh.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.900
I'm Lin Sa.

00:41:47.973 --> 00:41:49.440
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.620
How's it going?

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.100
Thrilling.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:59.910
Don't lie.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.350
The client loved your design so much.

00:42:02.417 --> 00:42:04.528
They added another half a million
to the budget

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.500
for a better design.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.310
So my commission is going up too?

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.310
As expected of Ms. Lin.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.200
Right.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.390
But Mr. Yu will have to redo the design.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.540
I'm not redoing it.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:17.480
Miss Fei.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.950
Quick. Capture this moment
of stubborn Mr. Yu.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.830
I'm putting this photo on my desk

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:23.670
to motivate myself.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:24.710
Okay.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.220
It's just a photo shoot.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.540
Did you have to send us all away?

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.350
Right? Was that necessary?

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.310
Yeah. Was that necessary, Mr. Yu?

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.660
It's just a photo shoot.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.020
Yeah. Mr. Yu, we're not outsiders.

00:42:39.751 --> 00:42:41.910
Let's take a group photo.
Miss Fei, take one for us.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.100
No, no, no!

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.940
Come on.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.950
Okay. Ready?

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.540
Three, two, one.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.119
