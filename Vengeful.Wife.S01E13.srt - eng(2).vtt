00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:49.820
That's impossible!

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.780
Lin Xia would never do that.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:52.899
Exactly.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.460
Here's the share transfer certificate.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.000
Take a look.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.740
This,

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:02.659
this,

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:03.740
this is actually real!

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.040
Everyone,

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:10.939
does that mean

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.500
I'm qualified to sit in this position?

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:24.340
According to the group's bylaws,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.420
the largest shareholder

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.700
may oversee major group affairs,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.379
serve as board chairman,

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:34.379
and appoint

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.439
the group's CEO.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.079
Therefore,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.340
I will

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.739
serve as board chairman

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.060
and CEO.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.180
Are you all

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.140
convinced?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.379
Then I'll proceed

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.180
with the second personnel appointment.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.980
Ms. Qin Yufei,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.040
VP of finance,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.480
is promoted to CFO.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.400
Ye Dong, don't get cocky!

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.579
Even as the largest shareholder,

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.020
you can't casually

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.819
replace the group's CFO!

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.560
As the new VP,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.900
is she qualified?

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.400
She isn't.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.280
But give her the chance,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.099
and qualifications will follow.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.919
She'll work her way up.

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:28.340
Moreover,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.780
with so many

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.159
qualified VP of finance,

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.580
even a pig

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.860
could become CFO.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.560
Right.

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.539
What I mean is,

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.259
I'll remain loyal to the group

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.780
and to Mr. Ye,

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.180
striving to excel

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.900
as CFO.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.500
- Enough!
- Qin Yufei...

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.620
Today's matters

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.659
are settled.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.439
I'm not here to negotiate with you.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.979
(Why am I at home?)

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.120
(Why)

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:14.819
(did Ye Dong do this?)

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.780
(Finding I was faking blindness,)

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.120
(he'll do this.)

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.539
(Furthermore,)

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.740
(he must have gained new leverage.)

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:24.864
(Share Transfer Agreement)

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.379
(What he made me sign)

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.439
(wasn't just about appointments.)

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:37.099
(Shares...)

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.680
(He must have acquired all shares,)

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.840
(so he shows his true colors.)

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.139
(He's achieved his goal.)

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.680
(Now he'll come for me.)

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.379
(Escape!)

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.759
(I need to get out!)

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.319
Stop!

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.519
You can see!

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.500
You witch!

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.420
You've been deceiving me!

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.300
Thankfully,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.639
you were sent back in time.

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:10.519
Otherwise,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.660
disaster would have struck us!

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.980
All of you are demons!

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.500
You deserve

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:17.899
to die a thousand deaths!

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.800
You...

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.360
You...

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.199
Let me go!

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.259
Help!

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.500
Help!

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.300
What's the noise?

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:29.579
Who's there?

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:35.819
Stop!

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.680
Don't run!

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:42.779
Halt!

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.899
Chase!

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:46.600
Chase her down!

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.040
Go!

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:09.199
Yes!

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.540
Have a death wish?

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.500
Dong,

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:17.720
Lin Xia escaped!

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:20.779
So many of you

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:22.000
can't keep an eye on her!

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:23.019
You losers!

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:24.519
Just moments ago,

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.079
she drove through the gate.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.519
Our men are chasing her.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.100
Listen!

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.120
Secure roads near the police station.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.759
Prepare an ambush.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.579
If she doesn't enter,

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:39.920
force her in.

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:41.300
Understood.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.100
Lin Xia's escaped?

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.220
She won't get far.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.300
Right now,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.980
go file a police report,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.579
accusing Lin Xia

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.500
of murdering Lin Na.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.459
Dong,

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.100
will this work?

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.579
Lin Xia called to meet Lin Na.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.300
But after meeting with Lin Xia,

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:06.100
Lin Na mysteriously vanished.

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:09.379
So Lin Xia

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:11.300
is the primary suspect.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.319
Moreover,

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.420
all the evidence can be verified.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.259
Most crucially,

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:20.259
Lin Na's bloody clothes

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:22.740
bear Lin Xia's fingerprints.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:31.860
No matter what methods you use,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.059
make sure you cement

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.139
Lin Xia's the murderer.

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:38.299
Got it.

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:52.720
What's happening?

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.080
Like a madwoman,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080
Lin Xia drove recklessly,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.539
but not to the police station.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.179
She broke the ambush

00:08:58.299 --> 00:08:59.440
and shook off our tail.

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:01.340
Useless idiots!

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:05.340
(Map)
She's on Dongjiang Road.

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:06.559
Good.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.460
I'll send pursuers.

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:08.279
Wait.

00:09:11.379 --> 00:09:12.620
Don't chase her aggressively.

00:09:15.379 --> 00:09:16.259
Listen.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.620
Help!

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:42.820
Help me!

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:47.179
Help me!

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.080
My baby...

00:09:56.139 --> 00:09:56.779
Hold on!

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:57.620
Go to the hospital.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.659
Please hurry!

00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.259
Alright.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.360
