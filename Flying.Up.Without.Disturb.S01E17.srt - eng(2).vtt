It's okay.

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:47.770
Brother,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.690
I'm tired.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.770
Please, stay here with me,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.330
both you and Kong Hou.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.651
Stay here with me.

00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:23.571
What?

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.490
Brother, stay here

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:27.011
with me.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.531
Because you got me killed.

00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:34.171
You got me killed.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.650
If not for your actions,

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:37.930
I wouldn't have ended up

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.731
dying in your arms.

00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:41.571
Dying in your arms.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.451
The one who got me killed

00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:48.330
is actually you.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.571
Actually you.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.770
You should stay here forever

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.090
and atone for your sins.

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.531
(I've actually forgotten)

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.490
(what I used to be like.)

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.851
(You weren't like this.)

00:03:08.851 --> 00:03:09.890
(You haven't changed.)

00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:11.210
(Execution)
(You never lost yourself)

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.370
(to power.)

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.090
(I'll definitely help you,)

00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.370
no matter how hard it is.

00:03:16.011 --> 00:03:16.691
(Huan Zong,)

00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:18.050
(did you come to see me)

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.531
because you have remembered me?

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.251
(It hurts.)

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:22.691
(How could it not hurt?)

00:03:22.971 --> 00:03:24.851
Though this is the inner demon realm,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.971
(it still)

00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:28.370
(hurts badly.)

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.691
(When you're ready for everything,)

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:32.971
(please tell me.)

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.571
I'll do anything for you.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.251
Brother,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.531
stay here.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.291
I remember now.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.131
I remember everything.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.971
What she said is true.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.731
You're not my brother.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.011
My brother would never

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:05.531
say such things.

00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:07.090
What did you say?

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.131
You're not my brother at all.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.490
This place

00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:17.971
is my inner demon.

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:28.771
It's all fake.

00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:16.050
Huan Zong.

00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:27.690
Huan Zong.

00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:30.690
Huan Zong.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.091
You've finally overcome the inner demon.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.731
You're finally recovering.

00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:36.130
You're finally awake.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.531
Do you know how I fear

00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:39.130
you'd be trapped there forever?

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.851
You're finally awake.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.731
Huan Zong,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.531
you remembered me?

00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.651
Look at my face and tell me.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.010
Do you still remember me?

00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:54.610
Of course, I remember you.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.531
You know what?

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.291
When you were

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.731
in the imperial palace illusion,

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.851
you claimed not to know me.

00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:04.771
Do you know how much that hurt me?

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:08.810
What's wrong?

00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:11.891
Did I hit you too hard?

00:06:11.891 --> 00:06:13.370
Are you unwell?

00:06:13.411 --> 00:06:14.291
No.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.091
Just feeling a bit uneasy.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.130
Come sit closer

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.291
and let me hold you.

00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:21.411
Alright.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.331
Huan Zong.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.050
Promise me.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.250
You'll never forget me again,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.531
okay?

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.411
I promise.

00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:38.411
I won't forget you again.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.411
You exhausted yourself

00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.171
in that illusion.

00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:45.690
I'll go find some spiritual fruit.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:46.971
Do you want some water?

00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:48.891
No.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.130
Like I said,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.731
just holding you will help.

00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:57.050
Huan Zong.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.771
You were...

00:06:59.891 --> 00:07:00.930
You were never

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.490
like this before.

00:07:03.091 --> 00:07:03.930
You...

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.171
How am I

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.250
different from before?

00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:10.291
In the past,

00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:12.690
no matter what happened,

00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:14.490
you never spoke up.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.930
You never expressed yourself.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.291
That's because

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.490
within my inner demon,

00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:27.010
I relived the pain of loss.

00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:29.930
For centuries,

00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:32.531
I thought I had forgotten.

00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:35.130
Now, I just want to cherish the present.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.050
So from now on,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.291
no matter what happens,

00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:41.411
we must be honest with each other.

00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:43.771
We can't let

00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:45.130
unspoken words

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.450
lead to lifelong regrets.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.050
I promise you.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.130
Who's there?

00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:01.130
This child

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.690
looks like the Crown Prince.

00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:10.091
How clever of you.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.010
Dressing in my brother's clothes

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.211
to deceive me again?

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:16.930
Though truthfully,

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.291
failing to save those
around me back then

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.531
left me tormented with guilt.

00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:24.651
So much that unknowingly,

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:26.690
it became my inner demon.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.331
But it's different now.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.330
Because someone has entered my life

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.330
who taught me

00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:35.611
to embrace

00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:37.251
life's simple joys,

00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:39.771
release my obsessions,

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.491
learn self-acceptance,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.090
and forgive myself.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.491
Indeed,

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:47.891
the past can't be changed.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.371
We must keep moving forward.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.850
Huan Zong,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.291
am I the person

00:08:54.611 --> 00:08:55.891
you mentioned?

00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:57.210
Of course, you are.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.570
Kong Hou,

00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:03.090
thank you truly.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.810
Where are you going?

00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:11.371
Now, tell us

00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:12.330
what's going on.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.090
500 years ago,

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.891
my master established a secret realm

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.090
beneath the cliffs.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.330
(And I)

00:09:20.411 --> 00:09:22.371
(am the key to open it.)

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.371
(My master also created)

00:09:24.371 --> 00:09:25.491
(a barrier there.)

00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:27.531
(It keeps this place)

00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:28.930
(hidden from the world.)

00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:30.411
(If anyone)

00:09:30.411 --> 00:09:32.131
(intrudes seeking me,)

00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:34.291
(they'll face their inner demons.)

00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.011
To prevent thieves

00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:38.970
from easily taking you,

00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:40.371
now

00:09:40.611 --> 00:09:42.891
I'll teach you to harness inner demons

00:09:42.891 --> 00:09:47.531
to create illusions.

00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:49.771
(Only by overcoming their inner demon)

00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:51.050
(can one leave alive.)

00:09:51.251 --> 00:09:52.491
(And only then)

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:53.891
(can my spell be broken)

00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:54.850
(to obtain me)

00:09:55.251 --> 00:09:56.371
(and open the secret realm.)

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.611
(Who could've guessed)

00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:00.690
that in this world,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.491
someone exists without inner demons?

00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:07.611
My magic is formidable.

00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:09.850
You two stayed there so long.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.050
It felt real, didn't it?

00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:13.730
You're feeling proud?

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.291
You nearly killed us.

00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:16.291
Brat!

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.411
Right now, immediately,

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.251
remove this

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:20.210
foolish barrier

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.050
at once.

00:10:21.251 --> 00:10:23.050
Take me with you, and I'll remove it.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.210
I've been stuck here for 500 years,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.330
dying of boredom.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.251
You little kid,

00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:30.450
hold out your hand.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.131
Take this! And this!

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.611
Stop! Stop hitting!

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.930
I'll open the secret realm,

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:35.730
satisfied?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.171
Aren't you just wanting

00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:38.171
to enter the realm?

00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:39.251
Not at all.

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:40.850
I fell fighting

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.651
dark cultivators.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.491
I don't want to enter the secret realm.

00:10:43.491 --> 00:10:45.330
And I'm here to find him.

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:46.611
I don't want

00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:48.011
to go to some secret realm, either.

00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:51.171
You two are so strange.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.450
You have no interest in me.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.251
Do you know

00:10:54.251 --> 00:10:56.531
how many people risk their lives
seeking me out

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.611
just to enter the secret realm?

00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:59.771
That secret realm

00:10:59.771 --> 00:11:01.690
contains countless treasures.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:02.651
People

00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:05.011
scheme day and night to get them.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.651
I've told you.

00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:07.450
Remove

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.210
the stupid barrier.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.651
Or I'll beat you again.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.050
For centuries,

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.131
I've never met anyone like you two.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
Do you know what the realm holds?

00:11:16.491 --> 00:11:18.090
Sword manuals, cultivation techniques,

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.411
spiritual tools, treasures,

00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:20.771
spiritual fruits, spirit herbs,

00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:23.011
and even the legendary Merfolk Scale.

00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:25.570
You mentioned the Merfolk Scale?

00:11:25.611 --> 00:11:26.330
Yes.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.411
I heard the Merfolk Scale
and the Cloudseeker Twig

00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:30.730
were hidden by the same person.

00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:32.771
If you know about the Merfolk Scale,

00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:34.651
do you also know
where Cloudseeker Twig is?

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:35.930
Cloudseeker Twig?

00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:37.210
I know it well.

00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:39.891
The immortal used
to fiddle with it constantly.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.651
You mean

00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:42.970
Cloudseeker Twig is also in it?

00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:44.651
Stop shaking me.

00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:46.570
Shaking won't make it appear.

00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:56.810
Just lift the magic.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.970
We need to find Cloudseeker Twig
and Merfolk Scale.

00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:23.611
The magic has been lifted.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:24.970
Let's go back.

00:12:25.171 --> 00:12:25.730
Okay.

00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:29.810
Kong Hou,

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.450
(Liuguang Sect Branch)
look how dangerous it was.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.690
Even if you escaped by luck,

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.330
tell me

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.491
if anything happened to you,

00:12:34.531 --> 00:12:36.611
how could I face our sect?

00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:38.891
My heart

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.651
is still pounding even now.

00:12:40.651 --> 00:12:41.570
Tan Feng,

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.330
why bring this up now?

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.330
I'm telling you.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.411
Once Huan Zong gets better,

00:12:45.411 --> 00:12:46.570
we'll return to Yunhua Sect.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.730
No delays!

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.611
Master has been

00:12:49.611 --> 00:12:50.251
unreachable

00:12:50.251 --> 00:12:51.251
without any reason.

00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:52.450
I had no idea what to do,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.450
almost going to the Head.

00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:55.730
Tan Feng, that's excessive.

00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:57.171
You're Yunhua Sect's

00:12:57.171 --> 00:12:57.810
treasure,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.411
the beloved one of me and Master.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.131
If anything happened to you,

00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:02.570
how could I go on living?

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.050
Lin Hu,

00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:07.570
how is Huan Zong?

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.210
Don't worry.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.371
All superficial wounds.

00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:11.251
Nothing serious.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.171
Good.

00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:14.411
I'll go check on him.

00:13:15.651 --> 00:13:16.730
Tan Feng, I-I...

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.891
I need to speak with you.

00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:18.651
Let's check it out.

00:13:18.651 --> 00:13:19.171
Let's go.

00:13:19.531 --> 00:13:20.450
Why dragging me?

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.090
Kong Hou.

00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:21.651
Kong Hou.

00:13:21.651 --> 00:13:22.291
What "Kong Hou"?

00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:22.810
This...

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.291
I have something for you.

00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:26.171
What are you doing? What's this?

00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:27.171
Why dragging me?

00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:27.970
Are you colluding

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.131
with Huan Zong to separate me

00:13:29.131 --> 00:13:30.050
from Kong Hou?

00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:31.330
How could that be?

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.411
I really

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:33.330
have something for you.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.171
What is it?

00:13:34.171 --> 00:13:34.970
Show me.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:36.810
What is it?

00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:39.930
Come on, hurry!

00:13:40.371 --> 00:13:41.251
- Senior Lin Hu.
- Senior Lin Hu.

00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:42.251
Well,

00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:43.171
let me introduce you.

00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:43.771
This is

00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:45.930
Senior Tan Feng from Yunhua Sect.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.371
He's an expert

00:13:47.371 --> 00:13:48.411
at infiltration.

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.050
You've wanted to learn infiltration?

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:50.570
Well,

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.730
here's your chance.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.330
H-Hurry. Learn it now.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.411
Senior Tan Feng,

00:13:54.411 --> 00:13:55.491
we've long wished

00:13:55.491 --> 00:13:56.570
- to learn infiltration.
- Exactly!

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:57.291
Come on.

00:13:57.291 --> 00:13:58.291
Teach us.

00:13:58.291 --> 00:13:59.011
Take Tan Feng

00:13:59.011 --> 00:13:59.771
around for a tour.

00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:00.930
- Hurry!
- Let's go. Hurry!

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:01.570
Please teach us.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.011
Thank you, Senior Tan Feng.

00:14:03.651 --> 00:14:04.850
- Let's go.
- Come on.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.411
Teach us.

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:06.131
Kong Hou!

00:14:15.651 --> 00:14:16.930
Is anyone here?

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.011
Is anyone here?

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:25.570
Ling Bo?

00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:27.771
Anyone here?

00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:29.891
Ling Bo.

00:14:30.991 --> 00:14:31.491
Ling...

00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:32.531
Ling Bo, what's wrong?

00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:34.291
My legs...

00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:35.171
What happened?

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.730
Ling Bo. Ling Bo.

00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:45.690
Why is it you?

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.330
Let me down!

00:14:46.891 --> 00:14:47.690
You're awake.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.810
It's okay.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:49.810
Though I saved you,

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.131
don't get too emotional.

00:14:51.371 --> 00:14:52.330
Listen carefully.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.690
You mustn't tell anyone

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:54.450
about my injuries.

00:14:55.771 --> 00:14:57.251
Still protecting your pride now?

00:14:57.371 --> 00:14:58.850
Then tell me first

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.011
how you got injured.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:02.810
Not talking?

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.050
Then I'll tell everyone

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.570
Lady Ling Bo was hurt and disgraced.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:06.970
Put me down!

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.371
Put me down!

00:15:10.651 --> 00:15:12.090
So you do feel pain.

00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:15.131
Our Lady Ling Bo is truly impressive.

00:15:15.251 --> 00:15:17.171
To outdo her senior,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.651
she's even risking her life?

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:19.171
I...

00:15:19.771 --> 00:15:20.611
I was simply

00:15:20.611 --> 00:15:22.330
too eager chasing dark cultivators,

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:22.970
wanting to see

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:23.891
the situation below.

00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:25.210
By your logic,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.411
the entire Lingyou Realm

00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:27.690
should thank you?

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.050
Are you done yet?

00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:30.730
Let me tell you.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.171
You don't know
how dangerous that place is.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.491
Only Young Master

00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:35.251
and Kong Hou,

00:15:35.251 --> 00:15:36.011
the lucky one,

00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:37.251
barely managed to escape.

00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:38.330
You charged in blindly

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.611
without any knowledge.

00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:41.570
Will you stop talking?

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.011
From the moment we returned,

00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:44.570
you haven't stopped talking.

00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:46.411
Let me tell you.

00:15:46.411 --> 00:15:47.730
You were lucky

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.730
to fall into that mountain crevice.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.531
Otherwise,

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.371
if that inner demon barrier

00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:53.210
had taken you in,

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.371
you'd be dead already.

00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:59.131
T-Thank you.

00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:02.251
You're welcome.

00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:04.850
Anyway,

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:05.930
I've already sent word

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.171
to your sect.

00:16:07.171 --> 00:16:08.291
They should

00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:09.891
send someone for you soon.

00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:10.970
Well, Lin Hu!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.891
You broke your promise!

00:16:11.891 --> 00:16:12.850
- I...
- Didn't you promise

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.291
- not to tell anyone?
- Wait.

00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:17.011
You told me not to tell others.

00:16:17.011 --> 00:16:18.371
I just told your sect members.

00:16:18.371 --> 00:16:19.570
Those are your own people.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.090
Rest properly now.

00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:22.011
I'm leaving.

00:17:23.851 --> 00:17:24.611
Huan Zong,

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.970
you're finally awake.

00:17:27.091 --> 00:17:28.651
Do I look that weak?

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.530
You do look rather...

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.290
What?

00:17:34.611 --> 00:17:36.210
Don't want me to take care of you?

00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:38.450
Then I'll leave.

00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:40.930
I need to talk to you.

00:17:41.171 --> 00:17:41.811
Sit.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.210
You want me to take care of you, right?

00:17:47.051 --> 00:17:47.730
Go ahead.

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.651
You already can play

00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:53.371
the phoenix-headed konghou now?

00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:54.571
Well...

00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:55.210
Yes.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.450
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.730
Is there something on my face?

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:02.411
No.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.490
How did you manage to play it?

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.770
(Have you ever considered)

00:18:15.891 --> 00:18:17.571
why you could play it?

00:18:18.851 --> 00:18:20.250
I don't know, either.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.651
No matter how I pleaded with it before,

00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:24.250
it never responded.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.010
It never gave me an inch before.

00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:27.611
I have no clue

00:18:27.611 --> 00:18:29.250
why it's acting differently this time.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.411
Could it be because this time

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.290
you genuinely wanted to save me?

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:34.970
Of course.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.811
We're good friends.

00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:38.051
Of course, I wholeheartedly

00:18:38.051 --> 00:18:39.210
wanted to save you.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:40.490
But

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.210
what does that have to do with playing

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.210
phoenix-headed konghou?

00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:46.730
This spiritual tool
senses your intentions.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.891
That's why it resonated with you.

00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:50.091
You wanted to save me,

00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:51.730
so the konghou

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.051
sounded for my sake.

00:18:53.171 --> 00:18:54.290
That makes sense.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:59.690
Are we

00:19:01.371 --> 00:19:02.970
just friends?

00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:05.690
Well...

00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:07.770
Of course, we are.

00:19:08.051 --> 00:19:08.970
We're

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:11.811
very close friends.

00:19:17.331 --> 00:19:18.770
Then let me make it clear.

00:19:19.611 --> 00:19:20.651
I never intended

00:19:20.651 --> 00:19:22.010
to just be your close friend.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.371
Did you hear my conversation

00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:30.290
with Tan Feng?

00:19:31.611 --> 00:19:32.571
You...

00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:35.171
What did you and Tan Feng

00:19:35.371 --> 00:19:36.530
talk about?

00:19:37.091 --> 00:19:38.171
I don't know.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.730
You didn't hear anything?

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.811
I thought it was because

00:19:41.811 --> 00:19:43.730
our hearts are connected.

00:19:44.091 --> 00:19:45.290
The phoenix-headed konghou

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.450
sounded for me.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.930
Not just because

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:48.891
we're friends.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.571
(Huan Zong is really...)

00:19:51.811 --> 00:19:53.210
(Who asks like this?)

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.010
(How should I respond?)

00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:57.250
I told Tan Feng

00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.811
I like you.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.250
Based on your reaction,

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.811
it seems you don't like me.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.091
Then if you don't like me,

00:20:13.091 --> 00:20:14.651
why did you tell me those things?

00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:15.210
I...

00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:18.051
What did I say?

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:19.811
You said it yourself.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.210
You'd take responsibility

00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:22.411
and protect me.

00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:26.051
I...

00:20:26.651 --> 00:20:27.811
I did say

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:29.571
I'd protect you.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.530
But

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.970
when did I ever say

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.770
I'd take responsibility for you?

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.851
So you agree then?

00:20:36.411 --> 00:20:37.371
To protect me.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.530
I...

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.811
I didn't mean that.

00:20:40.811 --> 00:20:43.490
Y-You're twisting my words.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.371
I never said that.

00:20:52.218 --> 00:20:56.984
♪Waiting for time to slow♪

00:21:00.544 --> 00:21:05.231
♪Oceans turn to dust in mere moments♪

00:21:08.571 --> 00:21:09.690
How can promises made

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.250
not count?

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.331
They count.

00:21:12.331 --> 00:21:13.770
I will definitely protect you.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:14.891
I'll keep my word.

00:21:15.819 --> 00:21:22.456

00:21:44.371 --> 00:21:45.371
Young Master,

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.331
you've been in good spirits lately.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:48.770
Do you and Kong Hou...

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:50.930
Young Master.

00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:52.450
What's on your mind?

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.930
Kong Hou and I found a lead.

00:21:57.091 --> 00:21:58.730
Merfolk Scale is in the secret realm.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:59.730
Merfolk Scale?

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.970
The secret realm
contains the Merfolk Scale?

00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:02.811
We came to Fengyi

00:22:02.811 --> 00:22:03.770
for Cloudseeker Twig.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:04.770
Now Merfolk Scale too?

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.450
That's perfect.

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:06.651
So next,

00:22:06.651 --> 00:22:07.851
head to the secret realm?

00:22:07.851 --> 00:22:08.490
Yes.

00:22:09.051 --> 00:22:11.051
But dark cultivators
must have heard too.

00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:11.851
So we need to talk

00:22:11.851 --> 00:22:12.770
to the major sects

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.970
and go there together.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.331
Dark cultivators want
to enter the secret realm.

00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:17.131
There must be

00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:18.411
something they want inside.

00:22:18.411 --> 00:22:19.530
And it's no ordinary item.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.250
But the two old fools Wu Xi and Wu Bei

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.331
still refuse to talk.

00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:23.811
They merely follow

00:22:23.811 --> 00:22:25.290
Jiusu's orders like puppets.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.450
But Jiusu's true motives

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.131
would never be shared with them.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.250
Yes.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.690
By current calculations,

00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:33.490
they should reach the sect soon.

00:22:33.651 --> 00:22:34.930
How the sect will handle this?

00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:36.930
Liuguang Sect never shirks duty.

00:22:37.131 --> 00:22:39.970
The secret realm will be opened.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.490
- My lord, welcome back from seclusion.
- My lord, welcome back from seclusion.

00:23:02.811 --> 00:23:04.690
I hear during my seclusion,

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.770
your two brothers got captured

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.371
and were thoroughly beaten.

00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:09.450
What?

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.290
Haven't rescued them yet?

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.851
Liuguang Sect came prepared.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.891
Not only did the rescue fail,

00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:18.171
we lost several key fighters.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.730
Why save those incompetents?

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:20.611
They failed the Lord's

00:23:20.611 --> 00:23:21.490
assigned tasks.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.571
The secret realm's key

00:23:22.571 --> 00:23:23.571
was also taken by those

00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:24.450
righteous fools.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.371
Actually, I should thank them.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.210
They retrieved the key swiftly.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.290
It seems Lingyou Realm

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.010
breeds talents.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.051
- I've failed you.
- I've failed you.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.290
My Lord,

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.290
please grant me reinforcements,

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.530
and I'll reclaim the key

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.530
for you.

00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:45.051
Reclaim what?

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:45.851
You want

00:23:45.851 --> 00:23:47.210
to end up like your brothers,

00:23:47.411 --> 00:23:48.970
beaten and imprisoned again?

00:23:53.651 --> 00:23:54.571
Alright.

00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:56.930
As long as the secret realm opens,

00:23:57.331 --> 00:23:59.131
who holds the key matters not.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.851
You may leave.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.891
Yes.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.651
My Lord,

00:24:09.811 --> 00:24:12.250
one more report.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.171
Other matters don't concern me,

00:24:17.171 --> 00:24:18.250
but when it comes

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.171
to Kong Hou, I must intervene.

00:24:20.171 --> 00:24:21.290
I asked you before

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:22.690
to recall her, but you refused.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:23.851
Now she barely made it out

00:24:23.851 --> 00:24:25.091
of the inner demon realm.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.811
How dare you say that?

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.210
Where were you earlier?

00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:30.290
When your disciple vanished,

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.131
you vanished too.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.730
You criticize me?

00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:36.571
You're fooling around all day,

00:24:36.571 --> 00:24:37.770
cuddling that mangy cat.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.331
Do you even know where

00:24:39.331 --> 00:24:40.010
Ling Hui is?

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.210
Of course, I know.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.371
What's wrong with my cat?

00:24:42.371 --> 00:24:43.331
Then where is she?

00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:45.490
- Not your concern.
- Where? Tell me where!

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:46.171
Not your concern.

00:24:46.171 --> 00:24:47.091
Speak! Where is she?

00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:48.690
Enough!

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.051
Kong Hou's a clever girl.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.051
This journey has honed her well.

00:24:59.051 --> 00:25:00.530
She can even control

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.770
her natal spiritual tool now.

00:25:01.891 --> 00:25:02.770
When kids grow up,

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.131
they develop their own thoughts.

00:25:04.331 --> 00:25:05.210
Let's ask her

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.250
whether she's willing to return first.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.930
About Liuguang Sect inviting
the Ten Great Sects

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.490
to discuss opening the secret realm,

00:25:16.651 --> 00:25:17.690
we need

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.970
to decide quickly.

00:25:19.131 --> 00:25:20.250
Elder Qiu Shuang,

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.611
what do you think?

00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:24.611
Open it.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.611
We already obtained the key.

00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:28.331
Why wouldn't we open it?

00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:31.490
This secret realm was discovered
over 1,000 years ago

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.290
by Immortal Bo Yuan of Jiufeng Sect

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.091
before ascension.

00:25:34.171 --> 00:25:35.091
It's a land

00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:36.730
abundant with spiritual veins.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.690
Legends say it contains
various spirit herbs

00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:39.811
and treasures.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.450
The dark cultivators' goal

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.091
must be the treasures in it.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.651
In that case,

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.891
we'll await them

00:25:47.891 --> 00:25:48.851
in the secret realm.

00:25:50.891 --> 00:25:52.811
Liuguang Sect shares this intent.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.891
They propose that heads
of the Ten Great Sects

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.811
and the Rogue Cultivator Alliance

00:25:56.811 --> 00:25:58.371
dispatch suitable representatives

00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.930
to enter the secret realm together.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.250
However,

00:26:01.411 --> 00:26:02.450
we must maintain

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:03.690
utmost vigilance.

00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:05.851
Today's dark cultivators

00:26:06.091 --> 00:26:07.690
aren't mindless fools.

00:26:13.891 --> 00:26:14.571
Junior,

00:26:15.571 --> 00:26:16.290
look.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:17.730
Should we

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:18.651
send more gifts

00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:19.891
to Yunhua Sect

00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:20.970
to demonstrate

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.411
Liuguang Sect's sincerity?

00:26:24.171 --> 00:26:25.490
Lady Kong Hou

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:26.530
has repeatedly

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:27.611
saved Zhong Xi.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.970
Earlier in Yunhua Sect's
Forbidden Forest...

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.171
Don't worry.

00:26:31.171 --> 00:26:32.811
I already delivered them.

00:26:35.171 --> 00:26:36.210
Good.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.210
But reflecting on it,

00:26:39.611 --> 00:26:41.490
this girl from Yunhua Sect

00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:44.450
truly has remarkable character
and courage.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.811
She actually rescued Zhong Xi

00:26:46.811 --> 00:26:49.331
from the inner demon realm.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.331
This isn't just about good character

00:26:51.331 --> 00:26:52.131
or courage.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.411
Countless dark cultivators
and puppets descended

00:26:54.411 --> 00:26:55.811
with none returning.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.331
Yet she still chose to save Zhong Xi.

00:27:02.411 --> 00:27:03.490
Back then,

00:27:03.651 --> 00:27:05.891
when Lingyou Realm's forces were chaotic

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.930
and demons ran rampant,

00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:10.970
I'd just assumed leadership

00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:12.651
and panicked initially.

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.411
Observing Zhong Xi's

00:27:14.411 --> 00:27:15.490
extraordinary potential,

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.690
I relentlessly pushed his cultivation

00:27:17.891 --> 00:27:19.490
but failed to consider

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.051
his recent familial loss.

00:27:22.331 --> 00:27:23.371
This forged

00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:24.611
his current temperament.

00:27:25.091 --> 00:27:26.411
Yet now,

00:27:27.371 --> 00:27:28.851
he's found

00:27:29.051 --> 00:27:30.970
such a devoted companion.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.411
Senior,

00:27:32.571 --> 00:27:34.010
things will improve.

00:27:34.811 --> 00:27:36.250
But recently,

00:27:36.891 --> 00:27:38.450
Zhong Xi's condition...

00:27:42.171 --> 00:27:43.051
This time,

00:27:43.611 --> 00:27:45.891
we must obtain the Cloudseeker Twig

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:48.091
and Merfolk Scale.

00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:49.970
We will.

00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:53.091
We definitely will.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:58.730
Much better now.

00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:04.371
Coming.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:08.331
Ma...

00:28:08.611 --> 00:28:09.611
Mother,

00:28:09.611 --> 00:28:10.690
what brings you here?

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:11.811
What do you think?

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.490
Come, sit inside.

00:28:19.811 --> 00:28:21.891
Mother, I've missed you terribly.

00:28:21.891 --> 00:28:22.730
Let me pour you tea.

00:28:25.811 --> 00:28:27.651
You called me "Mother" today,

00:28:27.651 --> 00:28:29.010
not "Master".

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.651
It seems you acknowledge your mistake.

00:28:33.851 --> 00:28:35.051
I know I was wrong.

00:28:36.051 --> 00:28:37.851
You really made me angry.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:41.091
I received Liuguang Sect's
messenger talisman,

00:28:41.171 --> 00:28:42.770
saying you almost died in...

00:28:45.371 --> 00:28:46.571
How's your leg?

00:28:46.811 --> 00:28:47.690
It's fine.

00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:49.131
That person who sent you

00:28:49.131 --> 00:28:49.811
the talisman

00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:51.051
is the most unreliable one.

00:28:51.051 --> 00:28:52.091
He always lies.

00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:53.530
It is just a flesh wound here.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:54.530
It'll heal soon enough.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.490
He did save you after all.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:57.851
Moreover, this time,

00:28:57.851 --> 00:28:59.450
you were too reckless.

00:29:00.851 --> 00:29:01.930
So what's your decision?

00:29:02.091 --> 00:29:03.851
Do you accept responsibility or not?

00:29:03.851 --> 00:29:04.571
I accept.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:06.371
I accept.

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:08.210
Then stay in seclusion for a few days.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.651
Use this time for self-reflection.

00:29:09.811 --> 00:29:12.331
But a few days later,
the secret realm...

00:29:12.331 --> 00:29:14.131
In your current state,
can you handle it?

00:29:14.131 --> 00:29:15.210
Why not?

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:15.811
Look!

00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:18.651
I'm fine.

00:29:18.651 --> 00:29:19.571
I can even jump.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.091
Mother,

00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:25.970
please let me go.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:30.411
Fine.

00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:31.730
You'll lead the team then.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:32.770
Really?

00:29:34.131 --> 00:29:36.051
What about Senior Chang De?

00:29:36.051 --> 00:29:38.051
He is also injured.

00:29:38.051 --> 00:29:38.690
Really?

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:39.250
You...

00:29:41.131 --> 00:29:42.490
Is he okay?

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.290
You're equally reckless.

00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:47.930
He can't even get out of bed now.

00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:49.611
He'll need several days to recover.

00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:51.490
Now, we have no choice but to send you.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.651
You must exercise extreme caution.

00:29:53.851 --> 00:29:54.851
I see.

00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:57.331
I hope Senior Chang De recovers soon.

00:29:59.331 --> 00:30:00.411
Mother, have some tea.

00:30:12.371 --> 00:30:13.091
What's wrong?

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.210
There's news from the sect.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.371
They'll open the realm.

00:30:16.851 --> 00:30:17.970
My master said

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:18.851
the secret realm has

00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:20.051
nothing to do with Kong Hou.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.851
He ordered me

00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:22.930
to bring her back

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.530
to Yunhua Sect without delay.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:25.651
Tan Feng,

00:30:25.651 --> 00:30:27.611
Huan Zong and I already agreed

00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:28.851
to look for the herbs together.

00:30:28.851 --> 00:30:30.571
I can't break our agreement.

00:30:30.571 --> 00:30:31.530
- Tan Feng.
- No rush.

00:30:31.611 --> 00:30:33.051
Let Tan Feng finish speaking.

00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:34.411
Yes.

00:30:34.411 --> 00:30:35.690
Take a cue from Huan Zong.

00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:37.930
Be more composed and less impulsive.

00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:39.690
Tell me.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.051
Is there a possibility

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.530
that when I got the talisman,

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.490
you two had already departed?

00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:46.970
Or perhaps

00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:48.690
accidentally,

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:49.690
I lost track of you?

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:51.970
Tan Feng.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.331
Putting it that way,

00:30:54.331 --> 00:30:56.250
you're quite brilliant.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.250
That's a good idea.

00:30:57.411 --> 00:30:58.171
Moreover,

00:30:58.171 --> 00:31:00.091
only Tan Feng
can pull this off successfully.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.730
Indeed, Kong Hou.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.331
Use your brain and some cleverness.

00:31:05.651 --> 00:31:06.411
Huan Zong,

00:31:06.411 --> 00:31:08.051
we can go search for Merfolk Scale

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.690
and Cloudseeker Twig together.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.571
Aren't you happy?

00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:11.411
Yes, I am.

00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:16.091
I'm still here.

00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:22.171
I never expected this foolish girl

00:31:22.371 --> 00:31:24.131
to possess such exceptional
spiritual roots.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.091
If we could harness her talents
for our cause,

00:31:27.891 --> 00:31:29.331
that would be nice.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.611
But now,

00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:35.250
she's closely aligned with Zhong Xi.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.730
They're practically inseparable.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:37.891
I truly

00:31:37.891 --> 00:31:39.450
can't find any opportunity to act.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.171
I implore your guidance, My Lord.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.331
No wonder you Wu brothers

00:31:43.331 --> 00:31:44.851
remain single your whole lives.

00:31:45.051 --> 00:31:46.131
What's her relationship

00:31:46.131 --> 00:31:47.331
with Master Zhong Xi?

00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:48.730
Then what should we do?

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.730
Are there any options?

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.411
But if

00:31:51.411 --> 00:31:52.930
we can't recruit her to our side,

00:31:53.131 --> 00:31:54.930
when her seal gets lifted in the future

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.450
and she joins forces with Zhong Xi...

00:31:59.331 --> 00:32:00.290
I will keep her

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:01.891
alive until then?

00:32:04.611 --> 00:32:06.371
Which sect's fellow cultivator
has arrived?

00:32:07.371 --> 00:32:08.770
It's Lady Ling Bo.

00:32:13.651 --> 00:32:15.490
Lady Ling Bo. We meet again.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.770
Kong Hou.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:17.851
Huan Zong.

00:32:18.051 --> 00:32:19.051
Tan Feng.

00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:22.051
I presume you all

00:32:22.051 --> 00:32:23.051
have received the news.

00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:24.010
We have.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.611
Gather at Secret Realm Valley.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.851
How surprising, Lady Ling Bo.

00:32:29.091 --> 00:32:30.730
After such a big incident,

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.210
your master still lets you out?

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.290
She seems to trust you.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:34.010
Shut up.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:35.690
What do you mean "shut up"?

00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:37.250
You greeted everyone

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:38.171
but skipped me.

00:32:38.171 --> 00:32:39.091
Why did you do that?

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:41.530
Fellow cultivators,

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.091
we'll meet at the secret realm.

00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:46.490
The cosmetic powder's scent

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.970
remains utterly intoxicating.

00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:53.411
Between you two,

00:32:53.411 --> 00:32:54.490
is there anything going on?

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:55.530
Nothing at all.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.010
I'll settle this with you next time.

00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:00.371
When's next time?

00:33:00.371 --> 00:33:01.450
Go on, tell me.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:02.811
Lin Hu,

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.571
once this secret realm opens,

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.091
dark cultivators might infiltrate.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.411
Don't worry, Young Master.

00:33:07.411 --> 00:33:08.730
No dark cultivators will get in.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.770
Let me tell you.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.210
It's rare for ten sects

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.530
to enter the realm together.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.450
How can you collaborate like this?

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.131
Zhaohan Sect's Lady Ling Bo

00:33:16.131 --> 00:33:16.970
is famed far.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.331
Offer her more support.
Resolve the misunderstanding.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.490
Okay.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.131
Yes.

00:33:21.131 --> 00:33:22.250
She's impulsive by nature.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.331
Keep an eye on her.

00:33:23.331 --> 00:33:24.530
Got it.

00:33:25.331 --> 00:33:26.411
Let's go then.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:35.891
Kong Hou!

00:33:35.891 --> 00:33:37.010
- Tan Feng
- Ling Hui.

00:33:37.331 --> 00:33:37.930
Huan Zong.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:38.571
Go ahead.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:42.051
Kong Hou, Tan Feng.

00:33:42.371 --> 00:33:43.331
Ling Hui.

00:33:43.331 --> 00:33:44.891
- Ling Hui.
- Kong Hou.

00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:46.371
I've missed you so much.

00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:47.091
Why did the sect

00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:47.970
send you this time?

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.250
It's a long story.

00:33:49.331 --> 00:33:50.611
In all my years,

00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:51.371
even when chasing

00:33:51.371 --> 00:33:52.371
new cosmetic ingredients,

00:33:52.371 --> 00:33:53.571
I've never traveled this far.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:54.891
Kong Hou,

00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:56.331
why not return to the sect?

00:33:56.331 --> 00:33:57.530
You master worries about you

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.010
and told me to bring you back.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:33:59.811
I...

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:02.411
I have unfinished business here.

00:34:02.411 --> 00:34:03.530
Business?

00:34:09.091 --> 00:34:11.451
What's going on here?

00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:12.890
I promised him

00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:13.730
to accompany him

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.330
to search for herbs in the secret realm.

00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:16.890
Kong Hou, you catch up.

00:34:16.890 --> 00:34:17.770
We will

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:18.370
rest there.

00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:21.051
Let's go.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:28.890
Search for herbs?

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:30.131
Is this really about searching

00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:31.370
or...

00:34:31.571 --> 00:34:32.730
Lady Kong Hou.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.250
Jin Ling, Zhou Xiao.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.290
Pastries for you.

00:34:40.491 --> 00:34:41.850
Thank you for saving me before.

00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:43.131
Kong Hou,

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:44.451
don't take their offerings.

00:34:44.451 --> 00:34:45.451
It could be a trap.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:46.730
Who knows if they still

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.051
collude with dark cultivators?

00:34:48.051 --> 00:34:48.730
Why did you

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:49.611
come this time?

00:34:51.131 --> 00:34:52.410
Where's Master Shuang Qing?

00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:53.210
I've heard all

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:54.131
about his noble deeds.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.370
My master

00:34:56.571 --> 00:34:58.210
was misguided back then.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.491
Misguided?

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.250
A momentary lapse can cost lives.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.011
She didn't give you trouble

00:35:03.011 --> 00:35:04.250
because she's generous.

00:35:04.491 --> 00:35:05.410
Don't think Yunhua Sect

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.131
is easy to bully.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:11.971
- Please forgive us.
- Please forgive us.

00:35:12.931 --> 00:35:14.011
You two.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.051
What are you doing?

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:19.730
This charade of yours

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:22.730
makes us look like bullies.

00:35:22.931 --> 00:35:24.410
That's not what we meant.

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.330
We sincerely came to apologize.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.531
Our past actions

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.451
are indeed inexcusable.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.171
However,

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:34.210
we will

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.290
soon get married.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:36.370
We've agreed

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:37.531
that coming to this realm

00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:39.011
is our way to earn forgiveness

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.451
through our actions.

00:35:42.171 --> 00:35:44.491
Cultivators don't dwell on trivialities.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:45.651
No need to explain.

00:35:45.651 --> 00:35:46.491
I know it all.

00:35:46.931 --> 00:35:49.011
As for these pastries,

00:35:49.011 --> 00:35:50.690
I happen to enjoy them.

00:35:58.362 --> 00:36:00.576
(Heaven and Earth's Desolation)

00:36:05.882 --> 00:36:07.424
(Heaven and Earth's Desolation)

00:36:14.571 --> 00:36:15.611
Lady Ling Bo,

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.850
we'll entrust this matter to you.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:29.850
Fellow cultivators,

00:36:29.931 --> 00:36:31.410
I'm Ling Bo from Zhaohan Sect.

00:36:31.571 --> 00:36:33.210
After consultation among elders,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.890
I'll preside over this gathering.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:35.571
Lady Ling Bo.

00:36:35.571 --> 00:36:37.210
I also seek your assistance.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.850
This secret realm expedition
holds great peril.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:41.051
Dark cultivators lurk outside.

00:36:41.051 --> 00:36:41.890
We must stay alert.

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:42.690
Therefore,

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.171
the major sects

00:36:44.931 --> 00:36:45.690
have decided

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:46.810
to have some of us here

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.091
to guard the entrance.

00:36:48.091 --> 00:36:50.091
Others will enter via lottery

00:36:50.091 --> 00:36:51.531
for realm access.

00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:54.931
Those drawing enter tokens

00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:56.250
may enter the secret realm.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.890
Those drawing stay tokens

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.890
will remain on guard.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.091
We must draw enter tokens!

00:37:02.091 --> 00:37:03.651
I'm certain we'll draw

00:37:03.651 --> 00:37:04.730
the enter tokens.

00:37:05.451 --> 00:37:07.690
I'm with Lady Ling Bo.

00:37:07.931 --> 00:37:09.091
Agreed. That works.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:10.410
Okay.

00:37:10.571 --> 00:37:11.890
We'll follow Lady Ling Bo's lead.

00:37:20.832 --> 00:37:22.410
Congratulations to the ones in front

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.131
for gaining secret realm entry.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.491
My master told me

00:37:25.491 --> 00:37:26.451
the key is to be kept

00:37:26.451 --> 00:37:27.931
by Liuguang Sect and Yunhua Sect.

00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:28.571
Now,

00:37:28.571 --> 00:37:29.931
you will open the secret realm.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.250
