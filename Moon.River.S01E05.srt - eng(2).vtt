(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:11.725
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:13.055
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:36.315
The red string of fate, once forcibly severed,

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.485
has found its match and begun to thrash wildly.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.015
It is out of my hands now.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:43.685
You two...

00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:47.855
will just have to navigate this cruel fate yourselves.

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:28.995
(Chapter Five: Walk a Mile in My Shoes)

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:44.515
Are you awake? You fainted when you fell into the water.

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:47.855
The Royal Physician stopped by. He said you are going to be fine.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:52.285
The Royal Physician is the Left State Councilor's man,

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:55.795
so he might report things he should not.

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:59.965
Good. Go get Shin Won and Se Dol for me.

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:01.695
I have to go to the palace.

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:06.465
Why would you go to the palace?

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.175
Wait. Why are you suddenly so informal?

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:12.805
Give you an inch, and you take a mile, right?

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.985
What did you dress me in?

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:20.555
Wait.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:31.525
It is gone.

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:36.495
It cannot be. How can it be gone? What...

00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:40.005
This... It is gone. Where did it go?

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:44.205
Why? Where... Where did it go?

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:48.045
Where did it go? No, that is impossible.

00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:49.515
No, hold on.

00:02:50.115 --> 00:02:51.115
This...

00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:53.714
What is it? Did you lose something? Is it important?

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:54.884
More than important.

00:02:54.885 --> 00:02:56.585
The fate of the 500-year-old royals depends on it.

00:02:57.015 --> 00:02:59.055
No, this has to be a dream. Right?

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:00.254
- Lee Gang, snap out of it. - You cannot possibly have that.

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:01.294
I will get you a new one... No.

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:03.054
- No, why? - I will get you a better one,

00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:05.094
- so calm down. - Calm down?

00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:06.425
You think you would be calm in my shoes?

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:09.835
It is gone. Not just anything. My manhood is gone.

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:11.565
And what is this?

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:14.674
- I have no idea what you mean. - Why? What is this?

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:16.405
- Why are these... - Dal, are you all right?

00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:19.305
I am the one who fell in the water, so why are you the one acting crazy?

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:20.405
Who are you calling Dal?

00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:27.245
Why is her face...

00:03:27.955 --> 00:03:29.055
here?

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:35.295
My face.

00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:38.725
Where did my face go?

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.605
What in the world?

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:02.555
Why is this here?

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:06.925
A rash, Your Highness? Shall I call the Royal Physician?

00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:09.055
Let me take a look first.

00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:11.625
Hey, where do you think you are looking?

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:27.345
That...

00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:30.115
That...

00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:36.585
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:04:36.655 --> 00:04:38.525
- Your Highness. - What is it?

00:04:39.325 --> 00:04:40.325
Your Highness.

00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:42.725
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.395
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:05:00.145 --> 00:05:02.115
How could he try to cut it with his own hands?

00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:10.885
- Please kill me, Your Highness. - Kill you? For what?

00:05:12.885 --> 00:05:14.225
Forgive my impertinence, Your Highness.

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:23.565
What?

00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:27.265
What is this? Why are you holding me bridal-style?

00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:29.305
Because if I am not careful, you might actually turn into one.

00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:32.075
Put...

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:34.575
Put me down!

00:05:46.925 --> 00:05:47.995
What?

00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:55.235
What?

00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:00.835
Wait, what is this?

00:06:01.775 --> 00:06:03.475
Why do I have that guy's face?

00:06:25.965 --> 00:06:28.535
You mean you are Gang?

00:06:29.335 --> 00:06:30.395
The Crown Prince?

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:32.265
Yes.

00:06:32.535 --> 00:06:34.235
I know it is hard to believe, but it is true.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.935
So, you must take me to the palace at once.

00:06:37.405 --> 00:06:40.144
Of course, the Crown Prince must be in a palace.

00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:41.145
In that case,

00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:43.045
shall I take you to the Crown Prince's quarters?

00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:44.185
Yes.

00:06:44.685 --> 00:06:48.485
I knew you would believe me. We must hurry to the palace.

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:54.695
Dal. How badly are you hurt?

00:06:56.355 --> 00:06:59.565
- You do not have a fever. - How dare you, you insolent fool.

00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:02.065
Is this how you abuse your royal status?

00:07:02.235 --> 00:07:04.365
Harassing women in broad daylight by touching their foreheads?

00:07:05.105 --> 00:07:06.135
Darn it.

00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:11.075
That, I almost said.

00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:14.715
It feels like I have already heard every insult,

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:16.745
but I must be imagining things.

00:07:17.615 --> 00:07:18.685
Whatever.

00:07:20.785 --> 00:07:22.085
Where are you going?

00:07:26.055 --> 00:07:27.325
Dal.

00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:42.905
Instead of poking me with all these needles,

00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:45.605
I need to get out of the palace.

00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:47.845
His Majesty has ordered you to be confined.

00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:49.515
Confined?

00:07:50.175 --> 00:07:53.285
- What does that mean? - Your Highness, are you in pain?

00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:57.455
How did you fall in the water? You hate it.

00:07:57.515 --> 00:07:58.825
You should have been more careful.

00:07:59.385 --> 00:08:01.755
Something also seems a bit off with you.

00:08:03.395 --> 00:08:07.195
His Majesty has ordered you not to take a single step...

00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:08.665
outside of your quarters.

00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:12.365
Then, my body...

00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:14.805
No, I mean Dal.

00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:16.935
Bring me that girl, Dal.

00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:22.375
See the moon? Your Highness, when you recover,

00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:25.444
I will arrange for a magnificent moon-viewing for you.

00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:26.485
Goodness.

00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:29.655
No, not the moon!

00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:31.824
Dal, the person, with four limbs.

00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:33.954
Bring me my body!

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:35.055
Goodness.

00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:40.465
This is the last needle. You must remain calm, Your Highness.

00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:42.165
Why is everything forbidden?

00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:45.305
Oh, my.

00:08:45.835 --> 00:08:46.865
Wait.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.304
Where are you putting that?

00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:51.475
On the affected area.

00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:52.675
The affected area?

00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:54.815
On my head?

00:08:55.415 --> 00:08:57.444
What do you think I am?

00:08:57.445 --> 00:09:00.015
Am I a human pincushion to you?

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:01.915
Gosh.

00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:06.955
As soon as the Crown Prince awoke,

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:09.795
he kept asking for someone named Dal?

00:09:10.595 --> 00:09:11.595
Yes.

00:09:11.995 --> 00:09:14.435
The Royal Physician heard it himself.

00:09:15.365 --> 00:09:16.365
Could it be...

00:09:16.965 --> 00:09:19.765
the peddler His Highness saved that one time?

00:09:19.965 --> 00:09:21.134
I will look into it.

00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:22.135
(Chief Court Lady Jo Myung Im)

00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:23.175
And if...

00:09:23.435 --> 00:09:26.375
she is the same peddler, what should be done?

00:09:32.115 --> 00:09:33.215
Let go of me!

00:09:34.755 --> 00:09:36.714
You were asking for that peddler so desperately...

00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:38.155
in front of the Royal Physician.

00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:40.324
What are you going to do now?

00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:41.655
If the Left State Councilor sees the girl...

00:09:41.725 --> 00:09:43.055
who looks just like the late Crown Princess...

00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:45.665
Gosh! What are we going to do?

00:09:46.965 --> 00:09:48.265
So what if he sees her?

00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:49.735
He will kill her.

00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:52.504
Kill her? What are you saying?

00:09:52.505 --> 00:09:54.065
The first selection is in two days.

00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:55.734
He would never allow a woman near you,

00:09:55.735 --> 00:09:56.774
especially one...

00:09:56.775 --> 00:09:59.745
who resembles the late Crown Princess.

00:10:01.615 --> 00:10:03.945
Perhaps since you fell in the water...

00:10:04.845 --> 00:10:06.744
Have you become so foolish you cannot recall...

00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:08.355
something so clear?

00:10:08.385 --> 00:10:10.855
No, it is not that...

00:10:11.555 --> 00:10:14.455
Your Highness, if this were you,

00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:16.895
you would have already struck me.

00:10:17.095 --> 00:10:18.195
"I am going to kill you."

00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:21.095
You should be flying into a rage!

00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:23.465
Please, just hit me.

00:10:23.635 --> 00:10:25.635
- Just hit me! - Goodness!

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:27.605
I do not want to!

00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:33.145
- Your Highness! - What is wrong?

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:37.845
Your Highness.

00:10:53.395 --> 00:10:54.395
Grand Prince Je Un?

00:11:15.455 --> 00:11:17.585
Father, what brings you here?

00:11:19.585 --> 00:11:21.855
So this greenhouse went to you.

00:11:22.395 --> 00:11:23.854
Did Grand Prince Je Un give it to you?

00:11:23.855 --> 00:11:25.795
I asked what brought you here.

00:11:28.765 --> 00:11:30.635
The first selection is in two days.

00:11:31.305 --> 00:11:33.034
The late king gave this greenhouse to Queen Jangjeong...

00:11:33.035 --> 00:11:34.805
for her Royal Wedding.

00:11:35.605 --> 00:11:37.574
What will people say if a Crown Princess candidate...

00:11:37.575 --> 00:11:39.345
is seen coming and going to this greenhouse?

00:11:40.775 --> 00:11:42.715
Are you here to warn me to go along with the selection...

00:11:43.315 --> 00:11:45.015
without putting up a fight?

00:11:45.515 --> 00:11:47.415
And what if I refuse?

00:11:49.115 --> 00:11:50.785
The gun that shot the Crown Prince...

00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:54.895
- is still in my possession. - You already used that gun...

00:11:55.225 --> 00:11:57.655
to ensure Grand Prince Je Un's safety.

00:11:58.165 --> 00:12:00.925
So if you use that gun to avoid entering the palace,

00:12:02.335 --> 00:12:05.105
are you saying you will abandon Grand Prince Je Un?

00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:10.735
With that one gun,

00:12:11.445 --> 00:12:14.745
did you think you could wrap me around your finger?

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:16.445
No.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.415
Do you really think, for even a moment,

00:12:19.045 --> 00:12:21.585
that you have ever had me under your thumb?

00:12:23.555 --> 00:12:26.155
I am tolerating you because I still have a use for you.

00:12:26.555 --> 00:12:28.895
I will put up with you.

00:12:29.525 --> 00:12:30.525
So you...

00:12:31.495 --> 00:12:33.395
will live your life in gratitude.

00:14:15.565 --> 00:14:17.365
My lord, where are you returning from?

00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:20.765
- Why? Is something wrong? - A letter arrived from Qing.

00:14:37.985 --> 00:14:39.125
Eun Woo.

00:14:40.155 --> 00:14:41.185
Yes?

00:14:42.195 --> 00:14:44.125
Yes, I am Cha Eun Woo.

00:14:44.795 --> 00:14:47.225
And you are? You seem much younger than me,

00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:50.865
- Why do you speak so casually? - You want me to speak formally?

00:14:54.005 --> 00:14:55.335
My apologies.

00:14:56.035 --> 00:14:59.445
His Highness spoke of you so often, I felt like we were already friends.

00:15:01.075 --> 00:15:02.075
The Crown Prince?

00:15:02.745 --> 00:15:04.175
You know His Highness?

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:05.445
I do.

00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:07.315
Very well.

00:15:10.415 --> 00:15:11.655
Which brings me to my point.

00:15:12.355 --> 00:15:13.954
Take me with you to the Royal Office of Attire...

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.995
- when you go there. - The Royal Office of Attire?

00:15:16.295 --> 00:15:18.195
Honestly, this woman...

00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:20.425
You think you can just waltz into the palace?

00:15:20.925 --> 00:15:23.395
You startled me! There is no need to shout.

00:15:23.565 --> 00:15:27.005
These are the ears that listen to the counsel of loyal subjects...

00:15:27.065 --> 00:15:28.835
and the plight of the people.

00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:32.405
I stand corrected. In that case, you listen up.

00:15:34.145 --> 00:15:36.015
The way for you to enter the palace...

00:15:36.515 --> 00:15:38.115
- is nonexistent! - Hey!

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.185
Get lost!

00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:44.255
"Get lost?" Did you just tell me to get lost?

00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:49.955
Do not do anything you will regret. I am warning you.

00:15:50.455 --> 00:15:52.165
I said, do not do anything you will regret.

00:15:53.595 --> 00:15:54.735
Darn it.

00:15:54.765 --> 00:15:56.034
Bother me again,

00:15:56.035 --> 00:15:57.565
and I will have you dragged to the Police Bureau!

00:15:57.635 --> 00:16:00.235
You got a death wish? You will regret this.

00:16:00.305 --> 00:16:01.605
Mark my words!

00:16:02.535 --> 00:16:04.575
Hey! You louts!

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:08.145
Be careful with that silk. It is for the palace!

00:16:08.275 --> 00:16:09.275
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:16:15.255 --> 00:16:16.255
Right here.

00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:34.335
All right, let us see.

00:16:38.905 --> 00:16:42.575
- What are you doing? Get down! - I am leaving.

00:16:43.815 --> 00:16:47.585
- Get down from there! Leave that! - I am not taking it.

00:16:50.585 --> 00:16:53.925
You fools! What are you waiting for? Get her out of here!

00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:57.125
- I am leaving on my own. - What is all this commotion?

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.025
Goodness, Head Merchant.

00:17:00.165 --> 00:17:01.165
Gang.

00:17:01.295 --> 00:17:04.195
The court ladies Queen Dowager keeps sending to your chambers.

00:17:04.235 --> 00:17:07.005
They all come from the Head Merchant.

00:17:10.875 --> 00:17:14.575
My goodness. How can the resemblance be so exact?

00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:23.485
Your Majesty.

00:17:23.655 --> 00:17:27.825
Perhaps now is the time to say what you must.

00:17:28.055 --> 00:17:29.095
You are right.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:31.965
You wretched girl.

00:17:32.325 --> 00:17:34.465
You tried to sneak into the palace, did you not?

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.365
For that crime, I could...

00:17:36.735 --> 00:17:38.465
have you put to death right now!

00:17:40.665 --> 00:17:42.135
And what crime would that be?

00:17:42.805 --> 00:17:43.805
What did you say?

00:17:43.835 --> 00:17:45.175
The attempt failed.

00:17:45.645 --> 00:17:48.375
As for proof that I tried to enter the palace,

00:17:48.775 --> 00:17:50.815
I only hid in a palace-bound cart.

00:17:50.845 --> 00:17:52.845
I can just say I did not know, right?

00:17:55.415 --> 00:17:57.155
You are not afraid of me, are you?

00:17:58.055 --> 00:17:59.285
I suppose I am used to it.

00:18:00.185 --> 00:18:01.925
The nerve of this girl...

00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:04.225
You insolent girl!

00:18:04.755 --> 00:18:07.165
How dare you disrespect Her Majesty the Queen Dowager?

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:09.794
Respectful or not,

00:18:09.795 --> 00:18:12.335
you will send me to the Crown Prince's quarters, right?

00:18:13.465 --> 00:18:14.465
Because this face...

00:18:16.705 --> 00:18:18.845
is identical to that of the late Crown Princess.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:21.545
Did you tell her?

00:18:23.315 --> 00:18:24.615
I said no such thing.

00:18:24.775 --> 00:18:26.015
It is all so obvious.

00:18:26.945 --> 00:18:30.155
The Royal Secretary is exiled, and the bridal selection has begun.

00:18:30.385 --> 00:18:32.684
The Left State Councilor's daughter will be the next Crown Princess.

00:18:32.685 --> 00:18:34.955
And now that you have no allies in the palace,

00:18:35.225 --> 00:18:39.225
you must see me as your last card to play, do you not?

00:18:39.265 --> 00:18:40.824
You think that with this face, I can catch the Crown Prince's eye,

00:18:40.825 --> 00:18:42.395
become his concubine, and bear a royal grandson.

00:18:42.465 --> 00:18:44.295
A gamble you are willing to take.

00:18:45.235 --> 00:18:46.265
That is what you think, is it not?

00:18:49.775 --> 00:18:50.805
My goodness.

00:18:55.975 --> 00:18:58.415
Yes. You are correct.

00:18:59.715 --> 00:19:01.385
That is precisely how I intend to use you.

00:19:02.055 --> 00:19:03.555
You will steal the Crown Prince's heart...

00:19:04.085 --> 00:19:06.625
and conceive a royal heir. If you succeed,

00:19:07.155 --> 00:19:09.225
I will spare your life.

00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:13.225
As I have already told you,

00:19:14.595 --> 00:19:15.894
even if you turn me in to the police,

00:19:15.895 --> 00:19:17.395
my crime is not punishable by death.

00:19:18.535 --> 00:19:19.705
Do you really think that until now,

00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:23.005
I have only ever killed according to the law?

00:19:27.175 --> 00:19:30.645
Dal, once she was grown

00:19:31.145 --> 00:19:34.815
Lost her body

00:19:35.355 --> 00:19:38.925
From that wretched Crown Prince

00:19:39.485 --> 00:19:42.295
She received the divine punishment

00:19:43.595 --> 00:19:46.165
Shaba shaba

00:19:47.095 --> 00:19:49.195
Darn, shaba...

00:19:51.265 --> 00:19:54.765
Your Highness, why are you acting like this?

00:19:54.905 --> 00:19:56.774
You must eat.

00:19:56.775 --> 00:19:58.175
You will collapse again if you keep this up.

00:19:58.605 --> 00:20:00.845
Water flows from top to bottom, right?

00:20:02.175 --> 00:20:04.075
So food must be the same way, right?

00:20:10.515 --> 00:20:11.685
I cannot.

00:20:13.955 --> 00:20:15.055
Your Highness.

00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:17.595
The Left State Councilor is here.

00:20:20.525 --> 00:20:22.035
Who is it?

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:42.955
Your Highness, I, Kim Han Chul, have come to pay my respects.

00:20:58.035 --> 00:20:59.765
This is just...

00:21:01.465 --> 00:21:04.535
I have been lying down for so long, I feel a bit stiff.

00:21:08.175 --> 00:21:10.415
Here we go.

00:21:22.225 --> 00:21:23.225
Your Highness.

00:21:23.495 --> 00:21:26.795
- May I ask something of you? - What?

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.935
Yes. Of course.

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:33.105
It is about the girl you were searching for, Dal.

00:21:34.535 --> 00:21:35.535
Is it possible...

00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:40.605
that she is the peddler you saved the other day?

00:21:40.945 --> 00:21:41.945
What?

00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:45.345
No. That is not her.

00:21:46.145 --> 00:21:49.655
I was looking for her, but it is not what you think.

00:21:49.755 --> 00:21:53.425
There is absolutely nothing between me and that peddler.

00:21:53.785 --> 00:21:56.325
The only woman for me is your daughter.

00:21:58.095 --> 00:22:01.295
I certainly hope you mean that.

00:22:02.095 --> 00:22:04.535
Goodness. You do not have to worry.

00:22:05.205 --> 00:22:09.205
I will never be involved with her again. Absolutely never.

00:22:10.575 --> 00:22:13.505
This is the new eunuch who will serve you starting today.

00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:25.885
My name is Lee Gang Dol.

00:22:26.185 --> 00:22:27.185
Your Royal Highness.

00:22:30.195 --> 00:22:31.195
No way.

00:22:41.035 --> 00:22:43.775
Did the world turn upside down while I was not looking?

00:22:44.035 --> 00:22:46.145
Is there some new law that lets women be eunuchs now?

00:22:46.305 --> 00:22:48.045
That is what makes me so special.

00:22:48.645 --> 00:22:51.375
I made the impossible possible, did I not?

00:22:51.615 --> 00:22:52.915
Do you think I am complimenting you?

00:22:53.845 --> 00:22:56.085
I am asking you what on earth is going on!

00:22:59.225 --> 00:23:02.195
Then, please let me enter the palace as a eunuch.

00:23:02.355 --> 00:23:05.825
A eunuch? If a woman is caught impersonating a eunuch,

00:23:05.995 --> 00:23:07.965
you could die. Do you not know that?

00:23:09.295 --> 00:23:11.335
If you get caught, I will be in trouble too.

00:23:11.565 --> 00:23:13.105
Even if I were to enter as a court lady,

00:23:13.505 --> 00:23:14.905
the Chief Court Lady would fire me,

00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:17.205
and I would never even get close to the Crown Prince.

00:23:19.245 --> 00:23:21.705
If you are going to use me, then use me properly.

00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:25.845
I will be the ace up your sleeve.

00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:38.195
There is no law in the whole world that allows this.

00:23:39.195 --> 00:23:41.225
There is absolutely no way this is allowed.

00:23:41.835 --> 00:23:43.595
If there is no law, you just make one.

00:23:44.265 --> 00:23:47.865
If that fails, you just break rules just to keep them on their toes.

00:23:48.065 --> 00:23:51.275
I am looking at the very picture of shameless audacity.

00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:54.605
If shameless audacity were a person, it would be you!

00:23:54.705 --> 00:23:56.845
What are you on about?

00:23:57.045 --> 00:23:59.315
Why steal my body and cause this mess?

00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:01.815
- This is all your fault! - What are you even talking about?

00:24:02.055 --> 00:24:03.384
If I had that kind of power,

00:24:03.385 --> 00:24:04.955
do you think I would still be a peddler?

00:24:06.025 --> 00:24:08.895
Hey, did you not have a red scar right here?

00:24:13.965 --> 00:24:14.995
What?

00:24:16.295 --> 00:24:18.805
Gosh, where did it go?

00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:20.605
The way I remember it, that day,

00:24:21.135 --> 00:24:22.935
a red light glowed from your wrist.

00:24:27.475 --> 00:24:28.475
Are you really...

00:24:29.615 --> 00:24:32.485
some kind of monster or an evil spirit?

00:24:33.915 --> 00:24:36.215
No, I am definitely not anything like that.

00:24:36.915 --> 00:24:38.585
But if this is the work of some strange spirit,

00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:42.025
should we not perform an exorcism or go to a temple or something?

00:24:42.095 --> 00:24:43.495
Are you out of your mind?

00:24:43.855 --> 00:24:47.765
"The Crown Prince prays to shamans" or "The Crown Prince has gone mad."

00:24:47.825 --> 00:24:49.365
Trying to spread that rumor in the capital?

00:24:49.465 --> 00:24:51.695
We are already at the point of praying to rocks and the moon.

00:24:51.765 --> 00:24:53.465
So why can we not pray to a shaman or to Buddha?

00:24:55.065 --> 00:24:56.105
Listen to me.

00:24:56.905 --> 00:24:59.145
The Crown Prince does not beg.

00:25:03.245 --> 00:25:04.314
- Then what? - Gosh, you scared me.

00:25:04.315 --> 00:25:06.745
What do you want us to do? What are you even saying?

00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:10.015
First, we need to get out of the palace.

00:25:12.485 --> 00:25:14.025
I have to get your confinement order lifted.

00:25:16.855 --> 00:25:17.895
Do you have a way to do that?

00:25:18.255 --> 00:25:19.325
The palace is, by nature,

00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:21.725
a world ruled by women.

00:25:24.095 --> 00:25:27.605
Lift the Crown Prince's confinement at once,

00:25:27.665 --> 00:25:29.435
Your Majesty!

00:25:39.285 --> 00:25:42.085
I asked you to get me out of the palace,

00:25:42.615 --> 00:25:44.255
not get me soaked in a bath.

00:25:45.015 --> 00:25:47.125
It was the Queen Dowager's condition.

00:25:47.685 --> 00:25:50.625
To lift the confinement, I had to attend your bath.

00:25:50.955 --> 00:25:54.265
She uses the same tricks every time. As if that would ever stir my heart.

00:25:54.325 --> 00:25:55.335
Goodness.

00:25:56.065 --> 00:26:00.935
So with a more "creative" method, could any woman sway your heart?

00:26:01.305 --> 00:26:03.505
Go on then, tell me.

00:26:03.805 --> 00:26:06.705
What "creative" method does it take to make a man's heart waver?

00:26:06.975 --> 00:26:09.045
Why are you asking me? You are the one who swayed my heart.

00:26:19.025 --> 00:26:21.484
You did not just make my heart waver.

00:26:21.485 --> 00:26:23.395
You stole my body too, did you not?

00:26:23.595 --> 00:26:27.195
Oh, great. So now this is my fault too?

00:26:27.295 --> 00:26:28.325
Yes! It is your fault!

00:26:29.265 --> 00:26:31.935
So, have you thought of a way to switch us back?

00:26:32.005 --> 00:26:34.205
Why do you always ask me?

00:26:34.405 --> 00:26:37.934
Is your head just a hat rack? Why do you not use it?

00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:39.205
This brain of mine is pretty good.

00:26:41.105 --> 00:26:43.275
Right. You have got a point.

00:26:43.845 --> 00:26:47.485
Remember, this was your idea, so do not get the wrong idea.

00:26:47.545 --> 00:26:49.315
Beggars cannot be choosers.

00:26:49.955 --> 00:26:51.585
What is it? Just tell me.

00:26:53.155 --> 00:26:54.155
It is...

00:26:57.525 --> 00:26:59.895
How about we recreate what happened that day?

00:27:00.295 --> 00:27:01.295
That day?

00:27:02.095 --> 00:27:03.595
The day we fell into the water.

00:27:04.495 --> 00:27:07.635
My last memory from that moment was...

00:27:09.235 --> 00:27:10.305
My last memory?

00:27:25.085 --> 00:27:27.185
The kiss?

00:27:29.025 --> 00:27:31.995
Yes. That is it.

00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:38.365
I have no ulterior motives. Our bodies just switched that day,

00:27:38.395 --> 00:27:41.735
so it makes sense to redo that day. That is all I am saying.

00:27:41.765 --> 00:27:42.805
Do it.

00:27:43.605 --> 00:27:45.945
- Do it? - Yes, do it.

00:27:49.445 --> 00:27:50.445
Okay. Let us do it!

00:27:55.455 --> 00:27:58.515
Let me repeat, I have no other intentions, okay?

00:27:58.615 --> 00:28:00.825
Technically, this was your idea anyway.

00:28:00.885 --> 00:28:01.985
I get it, just hurry up.

00:28:10.595 --> 00:28:12.105
One, two.

00:28:26.715 --> 00:28:28.045
Why did it not work?

00:28:29.115 --> 00:28:30.485
I was so sure that would work.

00:28:38.355 --> 00:28:41.225
Just do it properly this time. No holding back.

00:28:42.235 --> 00:28:44.095
- Properly? - Yes.

00:28:45.965 --> 00:28:46.965
Fine.

00:30:52.695 --> 00:30:56.395
We will never get it to work if you come up for air so fast.

00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:02.735
Your Highness.

00:31:03.105 --> 00:31:05.675
What gives you the right to kiss me underwater?

00:31:06.845 --> 00:31:07.845
I...

00:31:08.505 --> 00:31:12.485
You said to do it properly, so I was recreating that exact day.

00:31:18.215 --> 00:31:21.185
What is with him all of a sudden?

00:31:36.005 --> 00:31:37.005
Here.

00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:40.775
I know you are mad I kissed you three times without asking,

00:31:42.105 --> 00:31:43.245
but here, cover yourself with this.

00:31:43.715 --> 00:31:44.745
You will catch a cold.

00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:00.465
I am not angry.

00:32:02.535 --> 00:32:03.865
I was just a bit surprised, that is all.

00:32:12.235 --> 00:32:14.045
Who said you could be so reckless with my body?

00:32:17.575 --> 00:32:20.645
Let us go to my chambers. We still have things to discuss.

00:32:33.325 --> 00:32:34.495
Oh, my.

00:32:37.735 --> 00:32:41.005
Nothing sparks a fire between a man and a woman...

00:32:41.105 --> 00:32:43.905
like a hot, confined space.

00:32:44.835 --> 00:32:48.545
Truly, when it comes to romance, the classics never fail.

00:32:48.845 --> 00:32:53.145
Where did this little godsend come from?

00:32:53.245 --> 00:32:56.955
Your reign will begin again, Your Majesty.

00:33:07.765 --> 00:33:10.095
Gosh. Oh, for crying out loud.

00:33:10.565 --> 00:33:12.905
Now what are we supposed to do?

00:33:13.165 --> 00:33:16.205
Gosh. A peck did not work, and a real kiss did not work.

00:33:17.205 --> 00:33:18.605
Doing it underwater did not work either.

00:33:19.775 --> 00:33:21.675
Why are you taking that out on me?

00:33:24.075 --> 00:33:27.715
I came up with one solution. Is it not your turn to find one?

00:33:29.755 --> 00:33:32.115
After all, this is all your fault.

00:33:32.785 --> 00:33:35.155
If you had not nearly drowned that day,

00:33:35.385 --> 00:33:37.725
or if you did not have that odd scar to begin with,

00:33:37.795 --> 00:33:39.425
something this bizarre and outrageous...

00:33:39.495 --> 00:33:40.565
would never have happened!

00:33:41.565 --> 00:33:42.565
That is right.

00:33:43.135 --> 00:33:44.135
The scar.

00:33:45.965 --> 00:33:47.065
The scar!

00:33:47.905 --> 00:33:48.905
What?

00:33:52.805 --> 00:33:55.045
That day, the scar on my wrist was glowing.

00:33:55.275 --> 00:33:56.575
We both fell in the water,

00:33:56.915 --> 00:33:58.375
then we kissed. That was the order, right?

00:33:59.745 --> 00:34:02.045
You have to end things the way they began.

00:34:02.685 --> 00:34:05.655
We have to do exactly what we did that day.

00:34:06.485 --> 00:34:07.485
Again?

00:34:08.225 --> 00:34:10.425
You want us to fall in the water?

00:34:10.495 --> 00:34:14.395
Hey. Do you have another solution? You want to keep living like this?

00:34:15.565 --> 00:34:16.695
We cannot live like this.

00:34:20.105 --> 00:34:21.235
But...

00:34:21.535 --> 00:34:23.575
can we even get out to the bridge pier?

00:34:24.075 --> 00:34:27.845
The Left Flank Guard and Eunuch Yoon would not let me go.

00:34:29.645 --> 00:34:31.215
Then we need to find someone to help us.

00:34:38.085 --> 00:34:39.685
- Eun Woo. - Goodness.

00:34:39.885 --> 00:34:43.225
Oh, my. Your Highness.

00:34:43.555 --> 00:34:46.195
- Goodness, Your Highness. - Hey!

00:34:46.725 --> 00:34:47.725
Your Highness.

00:34:48.465 --> 00:34:51.035
Have you been well?

00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:58.605
- Get off me! What are you doing? - Where have I seen her before?

00:34:59.405 --> 00:35:02.545
- Why are you here? - See? Did I not tell you?

00:35:03.175 --> 00:35:05.775
I told you not to do anything you would regret. Right?

00:35:06.085 --> 00:35:09.455
He is the one! He threw me out and told me to get lost.

00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:12.155
- Eun Woo. - Yes? Yes? Oh, my.

00:35:14.085 --> 00:35:18.125
Eun Woo! You are the hope of Joseon!

00:35:18.355 --> 00:35:20.725
I am sorry? What?

00:35:25.435 --> 00:35:29.675
- Gosh! - Your Royal Highness!

00:35:30.505 --> 00:35:32.005
What are you doing? Hurry, go after him.

00:35:33.845 --> 00:35:37.775
Hurry and follow him! You are going to lose him!

00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:41.815
Come out, quick. Hurry up. We do not have time.

00:35:43.385 --> 00:35:44.385
Hurry, we have no time.

00:35:44.815 --> 00:35:46.055
Which way do we go? Where?

00:35:55.525 --> 00:35:56.535
Your Highness.

00:35:58.065 --> 00:36:00.765
- I am the only hope of Joseon... - Honestly.

00:36:05.905 --> 00:36:08.444
I am the only hope of Joseon.

00:36:08.445 --> 00:36:10.375
Hope, my butt. We are done for!

00:36:14.145 --> 00:36:15.145
All right.

00:36:16.155 --> 00:36:17.455
All right.

00:36:19.455 --> 00:36:21.855
Hurry up and stretch, you hear? We will be done if you get a cramp.

00:36:22.455 --> 00:36:23.795
Wait.

00:36:24.495 --> 00:36:26.425
If we pass out like we did last time,

00:36:26.765 --> 00:36:28.595
we will need someone there to pull us out.

00:36:29.195 --> 00:36:31.535
Shin Won and Se Dol should be here soon.

00:36:32.865 --> 00:36:35.634
Then why did we bother sneaking out?

00:36:35.635 --> 00:36:37.305
We should have just come with them.

00:36:38.405 --> 00:36:40.405
The Crown Prince nearly drowned.

00:36:40.705 --> 00:36:43.045
He wants to go back to the bridge pier to jump in again.

00:36:43.145 --> 00:36:47.045
If I had told them, would anyone have said, "Yes, Your Highness"?

00:36:47.145 --> 00:36:49.355
Or, "Allow me to clear the way for you"?

00:36:54.555 --> 00:36:57.125
I guess we will just have to wait then.

00:36:57.925 --> 00:37:01.565
- For goodness' sake. - What are you doing?

00:37:01.665 --> 00:37:02.865
Do not just sit anywhere. It is filthy.

00:37:02.935 --> 00:37:06.635
Gosh. This is how things get an unfair reputation. See?

00:37:06.865 --> 00:37:10.735
A king decides a fish is delicious and calls it a delicacy.

00:37:10.875 --> 00:37:14.775
Then it is just a common fish again. It is a sad life for the fish.

00:37:15.205 --> 00:37:16.675
Why are you suddenly talking about a fish?

00:37:17.145 --> 00:37:21.915
You are the one who slept outdoors while on the run for your life,

00:37:22.045 --> 00:37:24.415
but you are calling this very smooth bridge filthy?

00:37:24.485 --> 00:37:26.855
Now this bridge has been wronged, too. See?

00:37:28.155 --> 00:37:31.395
From now on, I will call you the Bridge of the Wronged. Okay?

00:37:31.455 --> 00:37:34.325
"Sniffle. So wronged."

00:37:35.425 --> 00:37:36.435
So wronged.

00:37:40.605 --> 00:37:42.465
All right, you are right.

00:37:47.345 --> 00:37:49.415
I am sorry, Bridge of the Wronged.

00:37:51.315 --> 00:37:52.345
Do not feel wronged anymore.

00:37:57.385 --> 00:37:58.385
Goodness.

00:38:01.685 --> 00:38:02.795
And as for you...

00:38:04.295 --> 00:38:06.295
- I am sorry. - What?

00:38:06.925 --> 00:38:07.965
So suddenly?

00:38:21.075 --> 00:38:22.575
You told me to say I was sorry.

00:38:23.875 --> 00:38:25.345
You told me to admit it was my fault.

00:38:27.885 --> 00:38:30.815
At a time like this, you should apologize.

00:38:32.085 --> 00:38:34.055
You should admit you were wrong.

00:38:35.525 --> 00:38:36.525
I am sorry.

00:38:37.825 --> 00:38:39.055
For saying you were low-born,

00:38:39.465 --> 00:38:42.325
and for being so cruel and careless about the hard life you have lived.

00:38:43.035 --> 00:38:44.035
For all of it.

00:38:49.605 --> 00:38:50.605
It is okay.

00:38:51.775 --> 00:38:52.975
You were not wrong, though.

00:38:56.245 --> 00:38:58.715
I just wanted to give you pretty clothes.

00:39:03.285 --> 00:39:05.585
I wanted to give you all sorts of beautiful things.

00:39:07.225 --> 00:39:11.095
I never saw you as a replacement for the Crown Princess,

00:39:11.725 --> 00:39:15.365
or as some kind of doll. Never.

00:39:17.795 --> 00:39:19.135
In fact, because of you...

00:39:25.205 --> 00:39:26.305
Because of you,

00:39:33.385 --> 00:39:35.645
there were days I did not even think about the Crown Princess.

00:39:37.085 --> 00:39:39.155
What? What are you blaming me for now?

00:39:41.485 --> 00:39:42.825
It is because of you.

00:39:44.525 --> 00:39:45.725
I knew it.

00:39:48.895 --> 00:39:50.435
If it were not for you...

00:39:51.635 --> 00:39:53.504
I would not have stopped the mat-rolling punishment...

00:39:53.505 --> 00:39:54.535
like a madman...

00:39:54.965 --> 00:39:57.535
or held a knife to the Minister of Personnel's throat.

00:39:58.835 --> 00:40:02.045
But because it is you, I am finding...

00:40:02.775 --> 00:40:04.375
that I do not mind this divine punishment.

00:40:20.395 --> 00:40:23.265
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

00:40:23.995 --> 00:40:26.035
- Your... - Your Highness!

00:40:27.735 --> 00:40:30.135
Looks like they are here. Get ready quickly, okay?

00:40:30.575 --> 00:40:31.575
Okay?

00:40:32.705 --> 00:40:36.275
Okay, on the count of three, we jump.

00:40:41.045 --> 00:40:42.045
One,

00:40:42.645 --> 00:40:43.655
two,

00:40:44.515 --> 00:40:45.515
three!

00:40:47.555 --> 00:40:51.155
- I cannot. - What? What are you talking about?

00:41:13.185 --> 00:41:15.345
He must be scared.

00:41:23.155 --> 00:41:26.265
- Why? - Just close your eyes tight.

00:41:26.895 --> 00:41:28.225
Do not worry, I am a great swimmer.

00:41:29.095 --> 00:41:31.835
I will protect you this time too.

00:41:35.035 --> 00:41:36.035
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:37.035
What do we do?

00:41:39.275 --> 00:41:40.275
Your Highness!

00:42:20.515 --> 00:42:23.015
What are we going to do now?

00:42:25.215 --> 00:42:26.885
Do not cry with my face.

00:42:27.555 --> 00:42:30.955
Would I not look like a lunatic if I started laughing right now?

00:42:32.895 --> 00:42:34.765
And watch your language.

00:42:44.705 --> 00:42:47.775
Your attire must also be proper.

00:42:48.875 --> 00:42:53.085
Hey, why are you getting so formal all of a sudden?

00:42:54.085 --> 00:42:57.855
From now on, you have to truly become...

00:42:59.485 --> 00:43:00.785
Lee Gang, the Crown Prince of Joseon.

00:43:02.425 --> 00:43:06.155
Your Highness, I have prepared your new royal robes.

00:43:06.665 --> 00:43:08.125
Do not shy away from luxury.

00:43:08.825 --> 00:43:10.665
The red lining matches Your Highness's personal color,

00:43:10.735 --> 00:43:14.635
which we have determined is the "Summer Ice" color type.

00:43:14.705 --> 00:43:16.335
Personal color, my butt!

00:43:16.535 --> 00:43:20.205
My people are poor and have to wear hemp clothes in the dead of winter.

00:43:20.405 --> 00:43:23.074
They cannot wash or eat, so sunburnt they cannot tell...

00:43:23.075 --> 00:43:24.445
their own skin tone,

00:43:24.515 --> 00:43:26.445
so why are we wasting money on the darn lining?

00:43:27.115 --> 00:43:30.955
Coastal villages cannot catch fish because of the rough seas,

00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:34.655
and the rice paddies have dried up and turned yellow from the drought.

00:43:35.085 --> 00:43:39.225
This meal does not reflect reality of the country at all, does it?

00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:44.265
- Your Highness, what do you mean? - Ignoring your people's suffering.

00:43:44.335 --> 00:43:48.565
The reason we serve local specialties on the royal table...

00:43:48.635 --> 00:43:51.475
is to stay informed of conditions in those regions.

00:43:51.535 --> 00:43:56.145
But from this table, you would think the country is a field of flowers.

00:43:56.645 --> 00:43:58.645
This is basically propaganda.

00:44:03.655 --> 00:44:06.055
Hey! Can you not do something about that accent?

00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:07.325
You speak the capital dialect well.

00:44:07.525 --> 00:44:11.925
Is the Crown Prince dissing people with regional accents right now?

00:44:11.995 --> 00:44:13.265
It is not that I am dissing them.

00:44:13.895 --> 00:44:16.735
But if I, a capital native, suddenly speak with an accent,

00:44:16.795 --> 00:44:18.065
would people not get suspicious?

00:44:20.235 --> 00:44:22.735
But there is something I have been wondering.

00:44:23.475 --> 00:44:25.835
Why are we hiding the fact that we have switched bodies?

00:44:26.445 --> 00:44:30.315
Should we not tell everyone we have switched bodies so that...

00:44:30.375 --> 00:44:32.414
it would be much easier to find a way...

00:44:32.415 --> 00:44:33.545
to switch back with everyone's help.

00:44:33.885 --> 00:44:35.915
What you want to go around telling everyone...

00:44:35.985 --> 00:44:39.955
is that the Crown Prince has gone mad? Is that it?

00:44:41.225 --> 00:44:45.225
"Everyone, I have switched bodies overnight with a peddler woman."

00:44:45.295 --> 00:44:49.495
"What should I do?" Do you think any minister will go, "Is that so?"

00:44:49.665 --> 00:44:54.135
Then say, "We will form a plan." You really think they would do that?

00:44:55.165 --> 00:44:58.275
Why keep using that brilliant mind of mine like this?

00:44:59.075 --> 00:45:00.075
Okay, I get it.

00:45:03.475 --> 00:45:06.375
- I get it. - That is better.

00:45:07.115 --> 00:45:08.585
To recap,

00:45:09.185 --> 00:45:11.855
be extravagant, ignore the people's welfare,

00:45:11.915 --> 00:45:14.885
use the capital's accent, and keep it a secret.

00:45:15.355 --> 00:45:16.525
That is everything, right?

00:45:17.125 --> 00:45:19.495
- Is that it? - We are not done yet.

00:45:21.295 --> 00:45:22.624
Pretend you do not know anything.

00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:24.764
"Things have root and branch."

00:45:24.765 --> 00:45:25.965
"Affairs have an end and a beginning."

00:45:26.265 --> 00:45:28.865
"To know what comes first and last is to be near the way."

00:45:29.035 --> 00:45:32.575
Gosh, since these men feast on dust instead of rice,

00:45:32.805 --> 00:45:34.375
it is no wonder all they talk is stale nonsense.

00:45:36.175 --> 00:45:37.345
Enough of this.

00:45:37.645 --> 00:45:40.585
Does anyone here know the price of rice or salt?

00:45:42.685 --> 00:45:45.985
Your Highness, why concern yourself with such trivial matters?

00:45:46.885 --> 00:45:49.125
Ancient sages spoke of governing to bring peace to the world.

00:45:49.355 --> 00:45:53.165
Your Highness should look forward and cultivate a ruler's virtues.

00:45:53.925 --> 00:45:55.565
Gosh, Judas Priest.

00:45:57.665 --> 00:46:01.235
- Did he just... - Pardon?

00:46:01.305 --> 00:46:04.275
I said, "Justice and Duty."

00:46:04.335 --> 00:46:06.845
"Principle and Esteem."

00:46:08.045 --> 00:46:10.975
Those are the virtues I will realize through the Great Learning.

00:46:12.115 --> 00:46:14.645
Compared to books for the nobility, the people's plight...

00:46:14.715 --> 00:46:17.655
is always met with a "Who cares?"

00:46:17.715 --> 00:46:21.585
And the people are the only ones who get ruined.

00:46:21.655 --> 00:46:23.895
However, I will simply "suck it up"...

00:46:23.955 --> 00:46:26.695
and, as my teachers taught me, get back to my studies.

00:46:26.765 --> 00:46:28.725
(To absorb knowledge through diligent study)

00:46:29.295 --> 00:46:31.735
And be cold to everyone.

00:46:45.845 --> 00:46:47.345
This morning greeting is unexpected.

00:46:48.315 --> 00:46:51.785
Is it not a son's duty to ensure his father is well?

00:46:53.225 --> 00:46:55.455
But why are you playing Go by yourself?

00:46:57.225 --> 00:46:58.325
Would you like a partner?

00:47:02.995 --> 00:47:05.235
The Crown Prince seems odd lately, do you not think?

00:47:05.535 --> 00:47:09.035
It started with the eunuch who looks just like the late Crown Princess.

00:47:09.165 --> 00:47:12.374
Be quiet. He even bathes with the eunuch...

00:47:12.375 --> 00:47:14.005
because he cannot get over her.

00:47:14.145 --> 00:47:17.945
- With a look-alike eunuch? - That is it. That is totally it.

00:47:18.015 --> 00:47:19.115
You are right.

00:47:20.585 --> 00:47:23.455
What has gotten into you, being so affectionate so suddenly?

00:47:23.615 --> 00:47:26.825
A son must naturally show respect to his father.

00:47:29.855 --> 00:47:31.795
Here, should I place my stone here?

00:47:32.995 --> 00:47:34.595
Consider your move carefully.

00:47:35.365 --> 00:47:38.195
- It is a picnic ko. - What is a picnic ko?

00:47:39.395 --> 00:47:41.935
One side has nothing to lose,

00:47:42.135 --> 00:47:44.405
but the other side must win...

00:47:45.075 --> 00:47:47.545
to avoid a major loss. That is the situation.

00:47:53.285 --> 00:47:56.145
I almost lost the game with that one move.

00:47:59.785 --> 00:48:01.685
It is said the world is but a single Go board.

00:48:03.425 --> 00:48:06.155
Human affairs are just one long game of Go.

00:48:08.595 --> 00:48:11.165
The Left State Councilor's daughter was chosen today, was she not?

00:48:11.895 --> 00:48:15.505
From now on, you cannot make a single mistake in any move.

00:48:42.425 --> 00:48:44.665
You are finally the Crown Princess.

00:48:45.335 --> 00:48:47.604
You are the master of this quarters.

00:48:47.605 --> 00:48:49.865
Do not pay any mind to the rumors around the palace.

00:48:50.435 --> 00:48:54.245
You did not think saying that would make me think of them more,

00:48:54.405 --> 00:48:55.445
did you?

00:48:55.675 --> 00:48:59.015
In any case, Your Highness.

00:49:02.815 --> 00:49:04.785
From now on, do not worry about anything else,

00:49:05.385 --> 00:49:08.655
and please live a long and happy life with the Crown Prince.

00:49:08.955 --> 00:49:11.055
- All right? - Yeo Ri.

00:49:11.995 --> 00:49:12.995
Did you know?

00:49:13.895 --> 00:49:15.595
Until the royal wedding is held,

00:49:15.665 --> 00:49:17.135
a woman is not the Crown Prince's yet,

00:49:17.935 --> 00:49:19.565
even if she has been chosen.

00:49:20.035 --> 00:49:22.805
What do you mean?

00:49:31.045 --> 00:49:32.675
Have you been well?

00:49:35.815 --> 00:49:37.755
I have not been doing so well myself.

00:49:38.985 --> 00:49:40.485
But you, my lord,

00:49:41.855 --> 00:49:43.795
will remain handsome forever, will you not?

00:49:47.465 --> 00:49:52.164
(Memorial tablet of the beloved Kang Han Seong)

00:49:52.165 --> 00:49:55.335
My lord!

00:49:56.435 --> 00:49:58.174
What is going on?

00:49:58.175 --> 00:50:01.075
Assassinating the Queen? Treason?

00:50:01.175 --> 00:50:02.344
Do not cry.

00:50:02.345 --> 00:50:03.474
(Kang Han Seong, Yeon Wol's brother)

00:50:03.475 --> 00:50:05.815
- You will ruin your beautiful face. - My lord...

00:50:07.945 --> 00:50:09.745
Can I ask you for a favor?

00:50:10.685 --> 00:50:12.785
- A favor? - I know it is a lot to ask,

00:50:14.625 --> 00:50:16.455
but please take care of the Crown Princess.

00:50:17.295 --> 00:50:19.025
When my father and I are gone...

00:50:19.495 --> 00:50:24.035
I cannot bear the thought of my dear sister all alone.

00:50:25.395 --> 00:50:26.735
No matter what happens,

00:50:27.765 --> 00:50:30.205
I will protect the Crown Princess, my lord.

00:50:35.445 --> 00:50:38.115
I am sorry it has taken me so long to say this.

00:50:40.315 --> 00:50:41.345
That I...

00:50:43.515 --> 00:50:45.555
hoped you would be my one and only.

00:50:47.955 --> 00:50:48.985
My...

00:50:50.725 --> 00:50:51.755
Hong Nan.

00:50:54.525 --> 00:50:55.525
My lord...

00:50:59.435 --> 00:51:00.435
My lord...

00:51:05.805 --> 00:51:07.475
Do not worry, my lord.

00:51:09.245 --> 00:51:10.475
The Crown Princess.

00:51:11.775 --> 00:51:14.215
I will protect her with my life.

00:51:16.385 --> 00:51:17.385
That...

00:51:18.085 --> 00:51:21.025
is the only reason I chose to live...

00:51:22.725 --> 00:51:24.425
instead of following you.

00:51:32.765 --> 00:51:34.665
We eunuchs, who protect the royals, must, in an emergency,

00:51:34.735 --> 00:51:36.705
carry His Majesty and our superiors on our backs and run.

00:51:37.175 --> 00:51:39.774
That is why maintaining our physical strength is essential.

00:51:39.775 --> 00:51:42.875
All of you, carry a sack of flour and run ten laps.

00:51:43.205 --> 00:51:45.875
If your sack bursts and spills, you get three extra laps.

00:51:46.075 --> 00:51:47.345
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:51:47.885 --> 00:51:50.585
(Eunuch Physical Fitness Test)

00:52:01.095 --> 00:52:02.925
Even rice sacks tear easily.

00:52:03.465 --> 00:52:05.265
But flour sacks? Darn it.

00:52:06.695 --> 00:52:08.005
Then complain to His Royal Highness.

00:52:09.235 --> 00:52:10.705
What does His Highness have to do with this?

00:52:12.905 --> 00:52:13.905
Hello?

00:52:15.005 --> 00:52:17.344
Well, now, look at that.

00:52:17.345 --> 00:52:18.875
I do not know which palace he serves,

00:52:18.945 --> 00:52:20.415
but that eunuch's master's head just burst.

00:52:20.485 --> 00:52:23.755
What? What an outrageous thing to say.

00:52:23.915 --> 00:52:27.855
Just because it is hard, they would drop the King or master?

00:52:28.225 --> 00:52:30.524
Hey! Change those to flour sacks.

00:52:30.525 --> 00:52:32.925
And add three laps every time a sack leaks.

00:52:33.055 --> 00:52:36.395
Darn it. I should have become a court lady.

00:52:42.165 --> 00:52:44.675
First place.

00:52:46.635 --> 00:52:47.645
So hot.

00:52:48.005 --> 00:52:51.045
- First place! - Gosh, what is his problem?

00:53:00.655 --> 00:53:04.025
I should have just become a court lady.

00:53:17.035 --> 00:53:18.075
Hey, you.

00:53:26.615 --> 00:53:29.845
You there. Which department are you with?

00:53:32.185 --> 00:53:33.255
Let me see your face.

00:54:06.755 --> 00:54:08.325
Hey, newbie!

00:54:08.655 --> 00:54:12.325
You little punk! I told you to clean up that flour.

00:54:12.395 --> 00:54:13.425
How dare you try to run off?

00:54:13.865 --> 00:54:17.595
Did you think I would not find you just because you were hiding?

00:54:19.835 --> 00:54:21.565
My lord, my apologies.

00:54:22.335 --> 00:54:25.675
But did you have business with our rookie?

00:54:26.475 --> 00:54:28.075
- Not at all. - I see.

00:54:28.445 --> 00:54:31.615
He can be a bit of a slacker,

00:54:31.715 --> 00:54:33.515
but he is definitely not a suspicious person.

00:54:35.085 --> 00:54:36.085
Why are you standing there?

00:54:36.585 --> 00:54:39.485
Go and clean up that flour! Hurry!

00:54:41.885 --> 00:54:43.155
- Yes, sir. - Right.

00:54:47.465 --> 00:54:50.065
My lord, you have some flour on your beard...

00:54:50.125 --> 00:54:51.835
What do you think you are doing?

00:55:01.445 --> 00:55:02.945
Take care, my lord.

00:55:09.645 --> 00:55:10.755
Goodness.

00:55:11.655 --> 00:55:15.285
That was the greatest achievement of my 19 years.

00:55:25.895 --> 00:55:27.605
You there. Are you not Dal?

00:55:27.965 --> 00:55:30.135
- Who is it now? - It is me, Master Heo.

00:55:30.675 --> 00:55:32.405
What, you do not recognize me in my official robes?

00:55:32.905 --> 00:55:35.605
Fancy meeting my daughter's savior here.

00:55:36.405 --> 00:55:39.175
So this is why I could not find you. I waited for days in Boryeong.

00:55:40.045 --> 00:55:41.985
Your daughter's savior...

00:55:43.615 --> 00:55:45.055
Are you Inspector Kim's father-in-law?

00:55:45.455 --> 00:55:47.685
Gosh, do not even mention that scum.

00:55:47.955 --> 00:55:50.695
Seriously, what were you thinking?

00:55:50.955 --> 00:55:53.765
She is a fragile kid who is not even supposed to be in Hanyang,

00:55:54.025 --> 00:55:55.795
and you ordered her to kidnap your widowed daughter?

00:55:57.195 --> 00:56:00.335
Says the one who should not be in Hanyang.

00:56:00.465 --> 00:56:02.665
You are not even a court lady.

00:56:03.005 --> 00:56:04.435
So, have you become a eunuch?

00:56:04.875 --> 00:56:07.205
That is just how it worked out.

00:56:09.275 --> 00:56:14.045
Did that lowly inspector really try to kill a high official's daughter?

00:56:15.545 --> 00:56:17.355
I cannot believe the Kim clan is that powerful.

00:56:18.085 --> 00:56:20.115
You even know the officials' ranks too?

00:56:24.795 --> 00:56:27.495
If he is Lord Heo, a high-ranking military official in Boryeong,

00:56:28.065 --> 00:56:30.225
then he must be Lord Heo Ok, the former Naval Commander.

00:56:43.105 --> 00:56:44.815
Your Highness!

00:56:45.475 --> 00:56:47.845
- You are hurting my ears. - You must listen to me now!

00:56:48.545 --> 00:56:50.045
That peddler.

00:56:51.055 --> 00:56:52.855
The woman who came to Sinjusa.

00:56:53.785 --> 00:56:55.455
She is a eunuch now.

00:56:56.825 --> 00:56:57.925
Where is she?

00:57:02.525 --> 00:57:03.865
It is not poisoned. You can drink it.

00:57:05.935 --> 00:57:08.735
Why did you bring me here instead of reporting me to the Eunuch Office?

00:57:11.375 --> 00:57:12.735
You must be scared.

00:57:13.235 --> 00:57:17.445
I suppose if it were discovered that a woman posed as a eunuch,

00:57:18.345 --> 00:57:20.345
you could be put to death.

00:57:21.115 --> 00:57:22.115
Do not worry.

00:57:22.645 --> 00:57:24.715
I will not report you.

00:57:25.255 --> 00:57:26.285
For now.

00:57:30.325 --> 00:57:31.555
What do you want?

00:57:32.755 --> 00:57:35.195
I plan to fight against my father.

00:57:35.865 --> 00:57:38.695
My father is using the Crown Prince to control the King,

00:57:39.265 --> 00:57:41.765
and I will use you to control the Crown Prince.

00:57:42.505 --> 00:57:43.565
And like that, I...

00:57:44.805 --> 00:57:46.905
will take Joseon for myself.

00:57:48.505 --> 00:57:50.775
She is going to use Dal as my weakness.

00:57:52.515 --> 00:57:54.085
Spoken like the Left State Councilor's daughter.

00:57:55.085 --> 00:57:59.255
Gosh, how many people are holding my life for ransom now?

00:57:59.615 --> 00:58:01.325
My goodness!

00:58:01.825 --> 00:58:04.555
I help out one person, and this is what I get?

00:58:05.455 --> 00:58:07.155
There is a limit to repaying a favor with betrayal.

00:58:07.725 --> 00:58:10.935
I saved his life, and now my own is being held for ransom,

00:58:10.995 --> 00:58:13.435
while he gets to sleep soundly and orders me to make his bed.

00:58:13.495 --> 00:58:16.165
- Goodness. - "He"? Did you say "he"?

00:58:16.565 --> 00:58:18.005
Did you just refer to me disrespectfully?

00:58:18.275 --> 00:58:20.235
When we are all about to die, what can I not say?

00:58:20.775 --> 00:58:22.205
Do not worry.

00:58:23.405 --> 00:58:25.375
You will be staying in my quarters for the time being.

00:58:25.775 --> 00:58:27.845
As long as you are here, the Crown Princess cannot touch you.

00:58:28.045 --> 00:58:29.045
What?

00:58:29.345 --> 00:58:31.885
- You do not care what others say? - Have you forgotten?

00:58:32.185 --> 00:58:33.655
To everyone else, you are a man.

00:58:34.425 --> 00:58:37.855
A Crown Prince studying all night, with his eunuch grinding the ink.

00:58:37.925 --> 00:58:39.225
Is there anything strange about that?

00:58:39.325 --> 00:58:41.865
Just because other people see a man, does that make me one?

00:58:42.125 --> 00:58:44.065
How are we supposed to share a room?

00:59:04.815 --> 00:59:06.415
I think I know...

00:59:06.955 --> 00:59:08.355
what you were expecting,

00:59:09.025 --> 00:59:10.325
but I am sorry, all right?

00:59:11.025 --> 00:59:14.665
I have too much royal work to do to be sharing a bed with you.

00:59:15.465 --> 00:59:17.765
What? I was not expecting anything.

00:59:18.335 --> 00:59:22.805
I was just thinking what a relief that is.

01:00:22.825 --> 01:00:25.495
That is why I killed Her Majesty, the Queen,

01:00:25.795 --> 01:00:28.205
and framed the former Crown Princess for the crime.

01:00:29.265 --> 01:00:30.304
That is why...

01:00:30.305 --> 01:00:33.975
you chose death instead of getting revenge.

01:00:34.605 --> 01:00:35.975
How pathetic.

01:01:21.355 --> 01:01:22.725
Were you having a nightmare?

01:01:24.895 --> 01:01:26.725
My heart...

01:01:27.595 --> 01:01:29.765
My heart aches.

01:01:30.525 --> 01:01:31.935
It is like I am underwater.

01:01:32.595 --> 01:01:34.235
I feel like I am suffocating.

01:01:57.225 --> 01:01:58.225
It is okay.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:06.565
Why are we out for a walk this late?

01:02:07.165 --> 01:02:09.805
If you lie down now, you will have that nightmare again.

01:02:10.505 --> 01:02:12.605
Walking for a bit should help.

01:02:13.175 --> 01:02:14.705
Do you have nightmares often?

01:02:15.645 --> 01:02:16.645
Pretty often.

01:02:18.215 --> 01:02:19.775
It must be your nightmares, Your Highness.

01:02:21.285 --> 01:02:22.915
Actually, ever since we switched bodies,

01:02:23.645 --> 01:02:25.285
I have been having dreams almost every night.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:29.055
Dreams about the Crown Princess.

01:02:30.185 --> 01:02:33.355
But they do not feel like just dreams.

01:02:33.895 --> 01:02:36.225
I think they are your memories.

01:02:39.665 --> 01:02:41.005
As if taking my body was not enough,

01:02:42.505 --> 01:02:44.635
now you have taken my nightmares too.

01:02:45.035 --> 01:02:47.175
Are you blaming me for taking your nightmares?

01:02:49.505 --> 01:02:50.745
Those nightmares...

01:02:54.445 --> 01:02:56.745
were the only way I could still see her.

01:02:57.885 --> 01:03:00.115
But ever since we switched bodies,

01:03:00.455 --> 01:03:02.585
I have not been able to have even those nightmares.

01:03:04.695 --> 01:03:05.755
I just realized that now.

01:03:14.365 --> 01:03:15.905
It is probably because you are in my body.

01:03:16.735 --> 01:03:18.905
I fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow.

01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:21.945
There is nothing for me to remember, anyway.

01:03:22.445 --> 01:03:23.805
Nothing to remember?

01:03:25.145 --> 01:03:26.675
The thing is...

01:03:28.045 --> 01:03:30.615
My parents... They are not my birth parents.

01:03:32.585 --> 01:03:36.825
When I was five, I lost my parents while running from slave hunters.

01:03:36.885 --> 01:03:40.295
I was left an orphan, all alone. My aunt was the one who took me in.

01:03:41.225 --> 01:03:43.395
Oh, my. What?

01:03:45.695 --> 01:03:49.865
- You never told me any of this. - At the time,

01:03:50.135 --> 01:03:54.675
I never thought we would be so tangled up like this.

01:03:57.645 --> 01:03:59.545
Besides, this palace...

01:03:59.615 --> 01:04:02.685
is a vicious place, you know?

01:04:02.985 --> 01:04:07.825
My parents and my aunt's only crime was raising a poor orphan.

01:04:08.185 --> 01:04:12.395
What if the Left State Councilor or the Queen Grand Dowager...

01:04:12.425 --> 01:04:14.365
end up hurting my parents because of me?

01:04:24.535 --> 01:04:26.175
You must have been so cold.

01:04:29.205 --> 01:04:31.075
It was like a winter night.

01:04:31.945 --> 01:04:32.945
A winter's night?

01:04:34.815 --> 01:04:38.585
They say I was chased by slavers when I lost my memories.

01:04:40.955 --> 01:04:42.455
When I opened my eyes,

01:04:43.425 --> 01:04:45.155
my mind was completely blank,

01:04:46.155 --> 01:04:47.825
but my memory was just a black void.

01:04:48.565 --> 01:04:50.465
When I came to and went outside,

01:04:51.065 --> 01:04:54.095
the sky was also pitch-black,

01:04:55.405 --> 01:04:58.735
and the deep snow I was sinking into was stark white.

01:04:59.905 --> 01:05:02.105
As I walked aimlessly,

01:05:02.605 --> 01:05:03.645
I thought to myself, "Perhaps..."

01:05:04.975 --> 01:05:07.275
"this can be my first memory."

01:05:11.415 --> 01:05:12.415
"Then..."

01:05:12.985 --> 01:05:14.825
"are these my first steps?"

01:05:17.525 --> 01:05:20.955
"In that case, today will be my birthday."

01:05:21.725 --> 01:05:24.165
"From now on, my season will be the winter night."

01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:25.795
That is what I decided.

01:05:27.335 --> 01:05:28.335
How can you be so calm?

01:05:29.505 --> 01:05:30.635
After everything you went through.

01:05:30.805 --> 01:05:32.235
What other choice do I have?

01:05:32.405 --> 01:05:33.575
I do not have any good memories.

01:05:33.635 --> 01:05:35.445
It only hurts me to dwell on the bad ones.

01:05:36.175 --> 01:05:39.415
And it is my loss if I just cower and blame my awful fate.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.145
What is awful about your fate?

01:05:42.715 --> 01:05:46.555
- You are incredibly lucky. - I would not say I am that lucky.

01:05:49.055 --> 01:05:50.755
No, you are very lucky.

01:05:51.095 --> 01:05:54.995
To be so fatefully entangled with the Crown Prince.

01:05:55.795 --> 01:05:56.925
So tell me.

01:05:57.595 --> 01:06:00.895
Your dreams, your wishes, anything.

01:06:02.605 --> 01:06:04.575
"Dream" is too grand a word for it.

01:06:09.575 --> 01:06:10.875
Other than straw shoes,

01:06:12.575 --> 01:06:13.915
I want one in silk shoes.

01:06:17.385 --> 01:06:20.215
Silk shoes? I will buy you over a hundred pairs of them.

01:06:20.385 --> 01:06:23.285
I will buy you enough to fill an entire room.

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:27.055
No, the "silk shoes"...

01:06:27.725 --> 01:06:29.565
It is a metaphor.

01:06:32.335 --> 01:06:33.335
Forget it.

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:40.435
There are two things that really annoy people.

01:06:40.635 --> 01:06:43.345
One is when someone stops talking mid-sentence,

01:06:43.845 --> 01:06:45.015
and the other is...

01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:51.485
And the other is?

01:06:53.915 --> 01:06:56.125
- What is it? - See?

01:06:56.555 --> 01:06:59.755
Now you know how curious I am to hear what you were saying.

01:07:00.825 --> 01:07:01.925
Gosh.

01:07:04.195 --> 01:07:07.935
Not a life of constant wandering,

01:07:09.235 --> 01:07:11.065
wearing out your straw shoes.

01:07:13.035 --> 01:07:14.235
But a life where I wear silk shoes...

01:07:15.405 --> 01:07:16.805
and walk at a leisurely pace.

01:07:18.345 --> 01:07:19.345
That is the life I want.

01:07:21.545 --> 01:07:23.285
Where I do not have to run anymore,

01:07:24.885 --> 01:07:26.555
and I do not have to live in hiding.

01:07:27.285 --> 01:07:28.525
A life where I can settle down...

01:07:29.925 --> 01:07:31.555
and make a real family of my own.

01:07:37.665 --> 01:07:38.665
What is it?

01:07:40.365 --> 01:07:43.405
It may sound as foolish as a fish trying to swallow the moon,

01:07:43.705 --> 01:07:45.175
but I am still allowed to dream, are I not?

01:08:03.325 --> 01:08:04.955
Your heels are not scraped up today, are they?

01:08:05.825 --> 01:08:06.825
What?

01:08:08.165 --> 01:08:09.165
No.

01:08:10.425 --> 01:08:11.435
Good.

01:08:21.075 --> 01:08:22.645
- Your Highness! - Your Highness.

01:08:33.255 --> 01:08:35.085
Wait...

01:08:36.425 --> 01:08:37.925
Just wait here for a moment.

01:08:38.495 --> 01:08:39.495
But I...

01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:41.125
Do not come in.

01:08:49.035 --> 01:08:51.775
What was that about? What is with this elaborate ditching?

01:09:02.315 --> 01:09:04.185
I waited all night.

01:09:09.655 --> 01:09:14.025
You cannot just mess with someone in the middle of the night.

01:10:15.155 --> 01:10:16.155
No.

01:10:16.885 --> 01:10:18.325
You were not supposed to come in yet.

01:11:01.035 --> 01:11:02.335
Black and white...

01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:05.005
do not just belong to the cold winter nights.

01:11:07.975 --> 01:11:09.205
So from now on, your season...

01:11:10.245 --> 01:11:11.445
will be a spring night.

01:11:12.975 --> 01:11:14.515
And from now on, the path you walk...

01:11:16.215 --> 01:11:17.345
will be a path of flowers.

01:11:37.405 --> 01:11:38.405
Should I make it snow?

01:12:38.665 --> 01:12:39.995
Do not stray too far.

01:14:02.045 --> 01:14:03.585
Am I still dreaming?

01:14:06.155 --> 01:14:08.955
Or was last night the dream?

01:14:11.085 --> 01:14:12.255
Why is my face...

01:14:18.265 --> 01:14:20.765
Goodness, what was that?

01:14:27.405 --> 01:14:28.605
Why? What?

01:14:45.355 --> 01:14:49.595
No. That is... It is not that. It is just...

01:14:55.735 --> 01:15:00.675
(Moon River)

01:15:15.855 --> 01:15:18.524
Young people these days play tug-of-war in love.

01:15:18.525 --> 01:15:19.925
They pretend to push you away,

01:15:19.955 --> 01:15:22.394
but the moment you drift apart, they pull you right back in.

01:15:22.395 --> 01:15:24.165
The tug-of-war in love.

01:15:24.295 --> 01:15:27.395
I am saying that if His Highness has other intentions,

01:15:27.635 --> 01:15:29.065
what guarantee is there...

01:15:29.405 --> 01:15:32.575
that the Gyesa Year Incident will not happen all over again?

01:15:32.635 --> 01:15:36.905
I heard Dal went to the capital. I will take her and leave Joseon.

01:15:37.005 --> 01:15:38.005
That he is in love.

01:15:38.945 --> 01:15:40.145
The Crown Prince loves Park Dal.

01:15:53.925 --> 01:15:58.025
(Moon River)
