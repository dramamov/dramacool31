(Song, Wei, Chu)

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.250
Why would the Great Sui army

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.790
be here?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.790
Go find another way out.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.230
Your Majesty,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.600
we have nowhere left to retreat.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.120
No one knows my movements today.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.790
How could you be here?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.240
Zhao Yue,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.040
your many misdeeds

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.790
bring you more

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.120
than public anger today,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.790
but also fate.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.190
The uprising army,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.330
led by the City Lord of Xuan,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.630
will soon reach Qizhou.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.190
Our plan

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.670
has reached its final step.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.560
Excellent.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.350
Finally, the day has come.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.230
Last time, bombing the workshop

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.910
was not enough.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.510
However,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.980
Zhao Yue would never wait for death.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.190
Amid the chaos in North Qi,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.350
he'll surely try to escape.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.400
With 11 cities rebelling

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.120
and our army at the border,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.280
escaping

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.350
through Baidi Valley to Dongliang

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.670
is his only choice.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.840
Leave this to me.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.600
I'll return to Qingzhou now

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.400
and tell Shilan to go to Baidi Valley.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.500
We'll be there to block his last retreat

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.700
before he arrives.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.720
Wenchang,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.980
once you leave Qizhou,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.630
you will be pursued.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.560
Be careful.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.840
I will not fail

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.680
my mission.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.900
(Song)

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.540
(Song, Wei)

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:56.750
Wei Yun,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.670
you deliberately let me

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.670
leave the Palace.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.880
How could I let you die there?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.160
Baidi Valley

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.510
will be the best place for your burial.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.720
Baidi Valley...

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.910
I remember now.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.190
Your father and brothers
and 70,000 Wei troops

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.550
died in Baidi Valley.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.840
But today, I still stand here.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.760
They are probably waiting

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.600
for you in the underworld.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.680
Zhao Yue,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.110
you stole

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.430
my octagonal crossbow blueprints

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.200
and slaughtered our soldiers.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.160
You relied on Queen Mother Yunyang

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.720
to seize Su Can's throne.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.200
Who do you think you are?

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.080
You're just a thief.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.520
Today,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.740
I'll let you see the true power

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.080
of the octagonal crossbow.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.400
As the Deputy Commander of the Bureau,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.830
I request to fight!

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.350
No more words.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.800
Let's just go.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.160
You failed

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.200
to defend Qingzhou.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.720
How dare you provoke me?

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.310
You must have no generals left.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.160
Even someone as useless as Song Wenchang

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.550
is allowed to lead troops.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.700
Since I'm here leading the Song Army,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.780
I am not afraid of you
exposing my wounds.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.990
As the Left General,

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.150
I request to fight!

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.000
Zhao Yue,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.480
you fancy yourself extraordinary,

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.280
plotting schemes

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.720
to seize our realm.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.600
As the General of the West,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.440
I request to fight!

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.640
How dare you

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.230
judge me?

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.280
All the people of Great Sui

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.430
have such a right.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.300
It's not just for my father

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.400
but for the countless heroes

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.350
who died on the battlefield.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.390
As the General of the Northwest

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.600
and Chu Jianchang's daughter,

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.990
in the name of the Chu Army,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.240
I request to fight!

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.440
Zhao Yue,

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.040
I'm not fighting alone today.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.600
My father and brothers
and 70,000 soldiers

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.350
died in Baidi Valley because of you.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.720
The loyal spirits of Wei heroes

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.990
stand with me today.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.390
Yes.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.350
With Changming here,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.520
don't you dare harm me.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.710
Step aside.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.020
The Eldest Princess...

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.470
I'm willing

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.990
to die

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.400
for Great Sui.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.400
Soldiers of Great Sui,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:22.750
attack!

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.310
Chu Yu,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.960
have you forgotten

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.800
our promise?

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.710
Today

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.960
is the long-planned

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.910
final battle.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.550
Li Changming.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.470
Do not worry about me.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.600
I'd never forget.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.110
Everyone, listen up.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.910
We won't return

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.600
until North Qi is destroyed

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.640
and Zhao Yue is dead!

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.720
We won't return

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.430
until North Qi is destroyed

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.990
and Zhao Yue is dead!

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.720
We won't return

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.350
until North Qi is destroyed

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.280
and Zhao Yue is dead!

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.040
We won't return

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.640
until North Qi is destroyed

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.600
and Zhao Yue is dead!

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.760
Charge!

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.230
Charge! Charge!

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.160
Charge!

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.540
(Wei)

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.920
Everyone,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.810
protect the King.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.050
Break through the encirclement!

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.950
Yes!

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.390
Chase!

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.240
Your Majesty, we have no way out.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.670
Though I'm the ruler of North Qi,

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.480
I have never truly seen

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.430
the lands of North Qi.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.430
These blood-stained lands

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.040
are exactly what I want.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.970
Changming, what do you think?

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.910
Peace across the realm

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.910
and a world free of war

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.120
are what a prosperous nation needs.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.430
These lands soaked in blood

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.590
are hell,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.240
not the human world.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.180
The best comes out of the worst.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.040
With fresh blood,
I shall cleanse Great Sui

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.120
and fulfill my lifelong wish
to unite the world.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.040
What's wrong with that?

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.240
It is a pity

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.590
that I may never see that day again.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.240
I thought fate favored me,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.790
yet in the end,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.430
I am left with only my life.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.710
Even if I die today,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.120
I will never let go

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120
of your hand.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.040
He has the Eldest Princess.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.160
Changming, look.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.830
As long as you are here,

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.190
they will not dare kill me.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:36.670
Is that so?

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.520
I do not think so.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.120
Because the blade that will kill you

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.880
is in my hands.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.080
Zhao Yue,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.960
do you know

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.040
that I was the one to kill

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.070
the child in my womb?

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.240
I knew long ago that the medicine

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.190
contained oleander.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.000
I provoked you into killing the consort

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.040
and imprisoning your mother

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.160
to exacerbate the coup.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:21.430
Zhao Yue,

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.790
your greatest enemy

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.070
has never been Chu Yu

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.710
nor Wei Yun.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.240
It has always been me.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.040
Li Changming,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.520
why did you do this?

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.580
Because you are unworthy.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.670
You are unworthy of being

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.640
a true ruler

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:43.880
and even more unworthy

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.640
of possessing complete happiness.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.400
And your brother deserves it?

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.190
Did he not also use you

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.630
to claim the throne he sits on today?

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.760
That was my choice.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.590
When you took me in back then,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.520
was that not your choice as well?

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.520
You approached me first.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.880
Our meeting was a mistake

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.830
because fate

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.070
bound us together.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.360
You said you loved me,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.670
yet you used me.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.520
In this life, I have never done

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.830
anything I regret.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.000
The only thing I regret

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.520
is saving you that day.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.000
Changming,

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.000
before you,

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.520
I was never the King of North Qi.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.400
I was your Xue Hanmei.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.840
I have only one question for you.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.760
Have you ever loved me?

returning at night.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.950
Your kiss is to tell me

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.790
that you do love me.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.120
Hanmei,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.360
in the next life,

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.070
let's not be born into a ruler's family.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.630
All right.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.320
I promise you.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.550
Changming, look.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.790
As long as you are here,

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.640
they will not dare kill me.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.630
Is that so?

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.430
I do not think so.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.670
Because the blade that will kill you

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.790
is in my hands.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.710
Though I've returned to North Qi,

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.310
(Qi)
it seems everything I have

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.480
was given to me by others.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.160
My mother gave me the throne;

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.280
the officials gave me authority.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.430
The only one I truly have

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.430
is you.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.550
Since childhood,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.040
everyone mocked me, cursed me,

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:01.910
and drove me away

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.320
because I'm baseborn.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.370
There's no place for me.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.360
I once thought

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.580
that becoming the King of North Qi

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.680
would change everything.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.870
But now,

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:15.860
what difference is there?

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.870
In their eyes,

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.040
I am still baseborn.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.590
It's never changed.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.390
In this vast land,

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.520
the only one I can have is you.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.840
I once wished

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.720
to place everything in this world

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.880
before you,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.840
yet never thought

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.920
that you'd mean everything to me now.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.630
Your Highness.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.600
Your Highness,

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.480
we can go home now.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.710
Chu Yu,

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.080
I am sorry.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.280
I will make you break your word.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.150
Your Highness,

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.590
I have the antidote pill

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.430
Tuantuan gave me.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.350
It can temporarily suppress the poison.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.630
Once we return to Huajing,

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.220
we'll surely find a way to save you.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.310
I can't go back.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:59.710
I've fallen in love

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.790
with someone I shouldn't have.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.830
I made Zhao Yue who he is today.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.960
I'm responsible for half of his sins.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.040
Even with Hanmei's blood,

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.070
his crimes can't be washed clean.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.350
I will pay

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.440
for the remaining half.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.190
Hanmei,

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.060
I've come to accompany you.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.120
Yu.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.430
I am here.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.600
I can't cry.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.790
It is not yet time to cry.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.240
There is still Queen Mother Yunyang.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.120
Yu,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.790
I am with you.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.120
So are we.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.150
Yue

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.110
was defeated in the end.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.720
We jointly issue this declaration today

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.390
to establish peace
between Great Sui and North Qi.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.350
Since the 18th day of the 3rd month

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.720
in Year 6 of Yuanle,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.110
the two states have agreed:

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.320
First,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.760
North Qi shall return

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.310
Yun City, Bai City,

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.150
and Yingzhou to Great Sui.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.890
It's been properly arranged.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.320
Second,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.200
North Qi ceases hostilities for 50 years

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.040
to maintain neighborly peace.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.040
These two terms benefit both nations,

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.630
and both nations gladly accept them.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.440
Between heaven and earth,

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.920
harmony is precious.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.390
Let this be our lesson.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.960
Let us uphold this pact

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.000
and preserve our friendship

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.590
for generations to come.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.680
You had the chance to strike us.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.390
Why did you choose

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.480
to sign this treaty with me?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.440
Why care so much
about these three cities?

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.100
We only go to war

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.280
to protect our homes and our nation,

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.580
not to seize land or take cities.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.390
What war brings

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.310
is not only so‑called victory

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.440
but wounds and sorrow.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.060
(Queen Mother Yunyang)

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.350
(Your Highness, do you see?)

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.160
(Your lifelong wish is fulfilled.)

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.870
(We will take you home.)

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.920
I'm Qi Lan from the 6th Division.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.830
I've completed my mission.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.190
Today,

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.590
I shall return.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.820
(Qizhou Posthouse)

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.820
(Fengling City)

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.060
For as long as I can remember,

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.380
Fengling has been

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.160
the most important stronghold
of Great Sui.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.550
My father died here in battle.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.480
My brother was wounded here.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.480
The Chu Army

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.390
fought countless battles here,

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:29.330
sacrificing many lives.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.250
I've also done everything I can

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.480
to protect this place.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.040
From today onward,

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.550
Fengling

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.630
will no longer be a border city.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.200
The people here

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.870
will no longer face blades and spears

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.920
but can live

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:02.630
in freedom and peace.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.550
Yun,

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.390
we did it.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.550
We can return to Huajing.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.280
We can

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.040
openly be together.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.910
Yu,

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.140
before I return home,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.370
there is one more thing I must do.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.280
I traded three years guarding the border

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.440
with the Emperor in exchange

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.760
for this trip to North Qi.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.360
Now that we've safely returned,

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:35.720
I must fulfill my promise.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.760
Very well.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.790
Three years.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.550
I will wait for you.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.800
But

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.070
if you dare be late,

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.790
I will take Xiaoqi

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.070
to live somewhere you can never find us.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.120
To you,

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.420
I will never break my word.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.340
(Sui)

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.480
I punched him in his face.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.440
I didn't see that.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.630
It was me.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:32.990
Commander Lu.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.880
Wenchang.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.360
How are you?

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.180
We're returning in triumph.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.350
I'm truly a hero

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.150
this time, right?

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.200
Your achievements

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.360
are indispensable.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.960
I forgot to ask you last time.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.680
Yun has been away
from the Arsenal Bureau for so long.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.700
Surely, someone noticed.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.310
If word reaches the Emperor,

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.280
will you

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.200
be implicated?

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.440
Though the Emperor tacitly allowed

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.510
Young Marquis Wei to leave,

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.690
he never ordered me
to withdraw the defenses.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.580
If the delegation returns safely,

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.150
I can redeem my fault with merit.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.280
But if anything goes wrong,

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.680
I will bear responsibility.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.790
Young Marquis Wei went to North Qi

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.210
to fight for our country.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.720
I had no reason to stop him.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.020
I'm as loyal to the sovereign

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.390
and the nation

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.560
as the rest of you.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.360
Good.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:38.790
As expected

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.630
of my brother.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.840
Shilan,

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.240
I wronged you last time.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.950
I...

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.080
I apologize.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.190
Wenchang,

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.440
I suddenly remembered

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.110
that you owed me something

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.200
back in Qingzhou.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:04.230
What did I owe you?

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.960
I will repay it.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.390
Song Shilan!

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:13.010
Catch him!

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.440
Are you afraid that I'll surpass you,

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.380
so you want to stop me?

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.280
Ms. Chu.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.120
What are you doing?

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.200
General Chu has a message for you.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.390
He said his legs

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:22.230
are almost healed.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.360
When you return to Huajing,

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:25.760
he might even

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.600
greet you in person.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.760
Really?

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:29.670
That is wonderful.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.150
For his legs

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:33.000
to recover so quickly,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.040
it seems the little thing I left him

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.110
worked quite well.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.960
Stop flattering yourself.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.310
It must be thanks

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.880
to Tuantuan's skills in medicine.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.000
All right.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.840
Both ways worked.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.630
When we return to Huajing,

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:47.500
I will prepare

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.780
a generous gift for each of you.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:50.590
However,

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.240
the ox chair you made for Linyang

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.210
may have to sit unused.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:54.480
It's okay.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.350
If not now,

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.290
he'll need it someday.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.870
I meant

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.590
when one reaches an old age,

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.030
one will not be able to walk, right?

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.150
If you talk nonsense again,

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.150
I will put it to use right now.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.070
Sorry, I was wrong.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.120
Do not dodge.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.110
Do not dodge.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.950
Catch him! Catch him!

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:15.280
I can surely catch you.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.760
Stop running.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.040
Catch him.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.550
Don't let him get away.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.630
Favored by fate,

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.480
I've ruled for many years.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.590
I've heard that sages fear destiny,

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.920
and emperors rule in cycles.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:37.920
As the Crown Prince,

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.440
Li Huan is virtuous and talented

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.630
and will be a wise ruler.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.870
He shall succeed me

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.630
and ascend as Emperor.

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.390
Thus decreed.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.650
The peace at the border with North Qi

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:03.780
for 50 years

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.590
is the achievement of Envoy Chu Yu,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.040
who led the delegation
to negotiate peace.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.280
Reward her.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.190
Chu Yu,

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.590
a woman who accomplished

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.070
what many men

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.440
dared not attempt,

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.860
is hereby granted the title

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.070
of General of Beifeng.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:26.590
(In Year 1 of Shunping,)

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.240
(Chu Yu became
the General of Beifeng,)

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.550
(the only female general of Great Sui.)

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.950
(Thereafter,)

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:34.310
(the imperial exams)

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.760
(were opened to women,)

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.350
(creating a path for women)

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.390
(to serve as officials.)

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.070
(Wei Yun became the Duke of Zhenguo.)

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.920
(To stabilize the nation,)

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.520
(he volunteered to guard the border
for three years.)

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.940
(Three years later)

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.520
- Rest more.
- Here.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.470
Thank you.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.120
Ma'am,

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.480
this is enough.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.000
Careful.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.080
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.680
Let me take your pulse.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.840
- Sure.
- Jin.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.310
Why are you also here?

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.480
Is there no training today?

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.000
Yun will return to report today.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.790
So, I asked General Chu
for half a day off

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.280
- to welcome him.
- You can't go.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.430
Why not?

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.760
I know.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.520
Yu must have told you

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:35.710
to stop us.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.960
Why is Shilan

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.800
not with you?

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.240
Has he gone already?

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.920
General Song went to Tugu Temple.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.960
He went to Tugu Temple too?

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.360
Too?

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.260
(Tugu Temple)

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.460
I want one.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.700
I heard they are very effective.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:58.630
I know.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:33:59.920
Is this the right way?

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.760
What should we write?

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.640
Write our names.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.020
(Song Shilan: May peace come.)

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:17.540
(Jiang Chun: May prosperity fall.)

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.140
(Huajing City)

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:28.300
(Sui, Wei)

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.700
(Wei)

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.050
After three years at the border,

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.670
we finally return to Huajing.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.550
Your Lordship,

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.330
you haven't seen Ms. Chu
for three years.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.440
Do you feel bitter?

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.590
I don't feel bitter

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:53.390
about anything else

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.520
but being apart from her.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.840
She is here.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.010
Bravo!

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.580
(Wei)

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.340
(Huajing City)

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.880
For your dance,

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.190
I'd gladly die before you.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.360
Wei Yun,

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:13.960
I've come to marry you.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.040
Will you marry me?

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.880
I will.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.660
Young Master,

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.270
Duke Wei returns today.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.270
The General of Beifeng

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.520
is dancing upon the gate tower.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.040
The road to the Palace is blocked.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.800
Take another route.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:09.860
(Gu Mansion)

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:15.960
I didn't expect there to be

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:17.780
such a beautiful place outside Huajing.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.630
All these years, we've hurried along,

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.040
but today, at last,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.110
we have the chance to stop

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.710
and truly behold these lands.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.880
We have always spoken of lands,

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.880
but what exactly do they represent?

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.400
They represent young generals,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
riding a fierce horse,
