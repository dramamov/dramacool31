00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.899
Step by step,

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.920
climbing over countless shoulders,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.880
I finally reached this position.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.340
As the CFO of a major group,

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.280
do you know how much I've sacrificed?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.640
I seem like

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.299
an invincible career woman.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.120
Truth is, I'm exhausted.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.920
I want someone

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.359
to lean on.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:18.879
Someone who truly understands me

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.599
and protects me.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.200
What a pity.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.200
Men in this world

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.200
rarely meet my standards.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.000
Drink up!

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.819
Why aren't you drinking?

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:36.560
Is the wine bad

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.920
or am I not tempting enough?

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:43.799
This wine

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.200
is really strong.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.420
Then drink more!

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.260
Get going and you won't feel dizzy.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.760
Here.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.079
Cheers.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:02.519
How exhilarating.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.000
Sorry.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.360
How clumsy I am.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.000
You should take a shower.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.879
I have pajamas.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:12.560
I'll take a shower.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.740
(Ye Dong)
(How is it going?)

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.039
(Qin Yufei)
(He went to shower.)

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.319
(It's about time.)

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.159
Why do I feel dizzy?

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.840
This wine smells good.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.080
This is not enough to drink.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.280
Bring the bottle over.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.240
Today, let's drink

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.159
until we're drunk!

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:10.280
Fine.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:02.479
Hurry up.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.419
Otherwise,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.479
you'll miss the great part.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.479
Ye Dong,

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.800
stop having those ill intentions.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.960
I trust Cheng Nuo.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.919
Even if you framed him today,

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:16.199
I believe

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.079
he'd never betray me.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:19.879
Your underhanded tricks

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.160
only prove your vileness.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:25.279
How could I frame him?

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.480
Your intuition

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.240
is unreliable sometimes.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.680
Seeing is believing.

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:30.300
Let's go.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.759
Do you think

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.839
all men are as rotten as you?

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.120
Today I'll show you

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.959
the difference between you

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.199
and him.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.920
The gulf between you and him

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.339
can never be bridged.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.019
As a demon wallowing in filth,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.079
you'll never know human decency.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.779
Fine.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.959
We'll see about that.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.660
I wonder when you'll admit the truth.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.120
Open the door.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.319
Cheng Nuo!

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.160
Honey.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:34.060
Honey.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.480
Honey.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.740
It's not how it seems.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:40.759
Men

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.399
are all the same.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.800
Honey.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:54.120
Are you

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.600
heartbroken now?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.240
For someone who doesn't love you,

00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:59.639
it's not worth it.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.920
Stop!

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.079
Bai Cha,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.000
only I'm crazy for you

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.139
and obsessed with you.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.480
I'll never leave you.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.019
Even after you married him,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.319
and even when

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.300
you carried his child,

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.279
I never gave up on you.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.759
Lin Xia.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:54.319
She is the one

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:57.439
countless men covet.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.639
For your sake,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.439
I married into the Lin family,

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:08.759
facing ridicule

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.040
and humiliation.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.920
But I kept thinking I can give you

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.120
a life of high society by doing so.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.279
That's what drives me.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.720
For you,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.279
I've recklessly

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.860
erased every trace of the Lin family.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.199
Tell me.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.360
I love you so much, right?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.720
You've

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.279
only loved yourself.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:45.879
Ye Dong,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.680
listen carefully.

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:51.100
I won't have feelings for anyone,

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:53.720
especially for you.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:55.879
What must I do

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:56.920
to make you believe

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.060
that I love you?

00:07:58.699 --> 00:07:59.259
For you,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.139
I can sacrifice everything.

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.120
I want your life.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.920
Will you give it?

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.259
Fine.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:35.960
But I want you

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.139
to die with me.

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:46.200
You really are a madman.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.539
However,

00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:53.059
I'll give you one chance.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.159
I want to be the CEO

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.019
of Jiuyao Group.

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:16.379
Do you dare to make a former
nightclub hostess

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.279
as CEO?

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.139
If you can't do it,

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:27.460
don't come to me again.
