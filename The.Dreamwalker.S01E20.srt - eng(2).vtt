00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:41.479
A bunch of blockheads

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.400
You attack without asking questions

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:45.240
If I weren't truly skilled

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.680
I might've been beaten up by you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.639
Let's see how many heads you have to pay

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:50.240
Servant

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:51.240
Blind fool

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.840
You hurt the Prince

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.279
You deserve a thousand deaths

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.959
Don't talk nonsense

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:59.520
Just you few

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.680
Think you can hurt me?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.080
Yes

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.760
The Prince's martial arts are superb

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.720
Of course

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.319
Enough

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.199
Get up

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.639
I can't be bothered to argue

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:11.760
Thank you, Prince

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.360
Speak

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.599
Why are you here

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:18.519
Who exactly are you after?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.919
Replying to the Prince

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:21.199
Recently

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:23.120
We've been ordered to arrest

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.160
Lan Hai Society rebels

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.279
Their base in the capital

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:27.639
Has already been destroyed by us

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.680
The others have all been captured

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.919
Only

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.360
The owner of the photo studio

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:34.599
Seems to have gotten wind of it early

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:35.760
He ran off long ago

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.519
We tracked him all the way here

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.120
Found this is his hometown

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.319
We believe he's hiding at home

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.760
So

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.760
We confirmed the address and came

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.919
Didn't expect

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.559
To run into the Prince

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:52.599
That person

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.760
Who is he?

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.559
He is the leader of the Lan Hai Society remnants

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.319
Shen Changfeng

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.000
What?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.240
Prince

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.919
You're also looking for him?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.839
More or less

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.679
But he's already gone

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:16.440
I guess

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.600
He sensed something beforehand

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:18.479
And already fled

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:19.919
He's truly clever

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.800
Escaped right under our noses several times

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.199
But

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:25.839
After tracking him all this way

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:26.559
We found

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.360
He was seriously injured recently

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.000
He shouldn't get far

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.240
Injured?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.199
Alright

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.720
Then hurry and go find him

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.600
Remember

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.600
Find him as fast as you can

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.320
And

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:40.479
I want him alive

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.839
If he's dead

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.839
I won't forgive you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.559
Yes

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.119
Didn't expect

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.240
This old lady is Shen Changfeng's grandmother

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.839
Looks like Shen Changfeng

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:54.759
Has really been hiding here

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:57.759
He can't hide much longer

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.240
Don't worry

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.679
We'll catch him this time

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.720
The old lady was fine a few days ago

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.119
Carrying a basket

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:11.679
Went to pick chestnuts

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.360
How did it suddenly...

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.919
Who doesn't wonder

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.600
But no matter what

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.199
We can't just leave her like this

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.240
Her funeral

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.800
We have to handle it

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.520
Right

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:24.720
Shouldn't we ask

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.919
Changfeng's opinion?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.639
He's her only family after all

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720
Don't mention that ungrateful wretch

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.520
Ungrateful wretch

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.759
Don't talk nonsense

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.919
He hasn't visited in over ten years

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.360
And after all these years

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.240
Have you ever heard her mention him?

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.320
It's not like that

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.600
She must be heartbroken

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.440
She probably forgot him long ago

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.240
Forget it

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.000
We've received her kindness since childhood

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.759
Her funeral

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.919
Let us handle it

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:46.240
Alright

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.919
Everyone lend a hand

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.839
Let's give her funeral

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.119
A grand send-off

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.800
Alright, yes

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:57.800
I have no idea what you all came here for.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:58.919
Hey, young man, look.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.559
Now the old lady is gone.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.880
We still have to handle the funeral.

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:03.199
It's fine.

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.600
We're just here on someone else's behalf.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.360
We came to check things out.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.880
With something like this happening,

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.679
we...

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.039
won't trouble you any further.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:12.320
Dali.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.279
Who is this person?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.119
He came looking for the old lady.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.399
These past few days,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.000
why are so many people coming for her?

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.640
Someone came yesterday too.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.679
When was that?

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.679
What did that person look like?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.839
Uh, uh...

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:24.920
It was yes—

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920
last night.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:27.959
Last month,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.760
the old lady

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.760
asked me to buy flour for her in town.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.640
Grandmother.

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:33.000
I just bought it back yesterday.

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:34.519
Grandmother.

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:35.839
When it got dark,

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:38.200
I hurried over to deliver the flour.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.920
Grandmother.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.920
It's me, Zhuzi.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:41.640
Grandmother.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.480
The flour you asked me to bring,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.559
I've brought it for you.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.440
Sorry to trouble you again.

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:47.679
Yesterday, as soon as I entered,

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:48.920
I saw a stranger.

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:50.000
Grandmother.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.679
You have a guest at home.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.200
So tomorrow,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.839
are we still going to pick chestnuts?

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.399
No, not going.

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:00.000
Grandmother has other things tomorrow.

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:02.799
Then, grandmother,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.119
I'll head out now.

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:05.040
Go on, go on.

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:06.720
Go ahead.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.799
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:12.279
But what if

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.640
that person was the one who harmed her?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.119
How could that be possible?

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:17.160
Besides,

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:18.359
nothing was stolen.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.679
The old lady

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:21.640
hanged herself, didn't she?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.959
She wore those burial clothes.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.399
She made them herself

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:26.839
in town a few years ago.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.839
She always had me bring her clothes back.

00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:30.119
That's right.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.119
Her things—

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:32.959
no outsider could know where she hid them.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:33.679
Exactly.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.480
So she must've found them herself

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.559
and put them on.

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:38.480
She dressed neatly,

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:39.519
clean and tidy.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.359
You could tell

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.839
she'd made up her mind to die.

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:43.799
Even though

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:46.000
I didn't see clearly,

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:46.880
but

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:49.600
I don't think that person was a bad guy.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.320
How can you be sure?

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.000
Were you close with her?

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:02.760
My house is just behind hers.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.600
She pretty much watched me grow up.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.079
So you know Shen Changfeng too?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.079
Do you also think he's an ungrateful wretch?

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.640
No way.

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:14.079
Changfeng had no choice.

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:16.239
The old lady understood him.

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:19.839
If Changfeng knew what happened to her,

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:22.519
he'd be more upset than anyone.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.920
Grandmother.

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.959
I'm back.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:26.040
Changfeng.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.559
Cuicui.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.239
How did you carry so much firewood alone?

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.320
It's fine, it's fine.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.399
I can do it myself.

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:32.559
I'm going to study at the Naval Academy.

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:33.320
After that,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.239
I'll join the Beiyang Army.

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:37.320
If I can't carry this much firewood,

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.720
how will I protect home and country?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.040
Grandmother,

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:46.920
I've told you before,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.160
these chestnuts are hard to peel.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.959
Wait for me to peel them for you.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.160
How could I let you,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.839
a future hero who'll protect home and country,

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:55.959
do such a small chore?

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:56.559
Grandmother.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.239
I protect home and country,

00:06:58.239 --> 00:06:58.839
I join the army,

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:00.160
but not to be a hero.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.200
Hurry, hurry!

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:03.600
There's fresh chestnut cake inside.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.000
Go on!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.480
Really?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.920
Grandmother.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.799
Your chestnut cake is the best in the world.

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:17.480
What do you know about "the world," kid?

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.239
It's just a chestnut cake.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.359
It tastes good

00:07:20.359 --> 00:07:22.519
because it's made with fresh chestnuts.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.279
You can only eat it at this time of year.

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:25.399
After this season,

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.359
it won't taste the same.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.000
If that's the case,

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:31.079
every year at this time,

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:33.279
I'll have to eat your chestnut cake at home.

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:33.959
Sure!

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:37.920
Give me one.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:39.920
None left, I ate them all.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.320
I'm not giving you any.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.880
Come on, give me one.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.519
No, no.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.160
Not giving.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.720
Give me.

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:51.640
Every year at this time,

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:54.160
the old lady would make lots of chestnut cake.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.399
She just wanted Changfeng to have some

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:58.880
when he came home, fresh from the oven.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:00.720
But he never came back.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.200
He had no choice.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.160
What do you know?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.239
Nothing.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.839
I have to go now.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.640
Brother Dali.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.160
Do you still have any Tianqi at home?

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:22.119
I hurt my leg a few days ago.

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:23.679
Yes, come with me to get it later.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.239
Let's talk about the old lady first.

00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:26.480
That person seemed off.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.279
We'll all have to handle her funeral.

00:09:34.119 --> 00:09:34.719
Changfeng.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.719
Shen Changfeng.

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:45.400
Who was the one who killed you?

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:47.119
Who is the mastermind behind all this?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Liu Cuicui has fainted.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.719
The killer can only leave from here.

00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:53.280
Darn it, I'll go take a look.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.159
Be careful.
