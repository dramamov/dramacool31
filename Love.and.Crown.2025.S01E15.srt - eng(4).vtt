after days of investigation,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.690
this is the only location we found.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.050
Kumor chose to set up camp here.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.210
With mountains on three sides,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.210
it's easy to defend and hard to attack.

Kumor is still waiting for the peace delegation,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.770
Tell me.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.340
How did you two meet?

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.850
I founded Fenglai Pavilion back in Southern Chu.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.180
She was recruiting a hall master,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.530
so I went to apply.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.710
But she wouldn't choose me.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.420
He kept pestering me.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.180
Only later did I realize

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.530
he had ulterior motives.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:34.980
What did he want?

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.580
He...

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.250
he wanted me.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.180
Love at first sight?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.980
She wanted to rescue the abducted youths.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.770
Even while gravely poisoned,

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.180
she still tried to protect me out of duty

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.420
as the Sect Leader.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.850
He did help me rescue

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.730
those children trapped in the mine,

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.130
and he risked his life for me

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.980
in the process.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.340
So you fell in love with him too?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.610
Then why did she come to Jiangzhou?

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.850
Why did you break up?

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.180
And why did you come?

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.770
We were incompatible.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.100
That's it?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.980
She thought I couldn't give her the freedom she wanted,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.180
so she left me.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.580
As for why and how

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.420
she came here,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.610
I have no idea.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.530
I just wanted to find her.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.300
I heard someone spotted her in Jiangzhou,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.700
so I came.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.890
Kumor,

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.340
why aren't you saying anything?

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.250
Everything they said matches.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.100
They met in the martial world.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.060
One is the leader of Fenglai Pavilion,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.770
and the other is a hall master chasing after her.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.730
They fought side by side, saved people with their swords,

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.730
fell in love,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.180
and later

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.530
broke up because of differences.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.420
Then Bai Chifan,

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.820
still in love with Lin Cangcang,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.420
rushed here once he heard

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.460
of her whereabouts.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.180
Are you still suspicious of them?

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.530
It all seems too much of a coincidence.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.300
But they clearly

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.130
had no time to coordinate a story.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.420
When I provoked the Jiangzhou garrison earlier today,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.490
Bai Chifan saved the two of us from the rain of arrows.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.730
When she saw him, Lin Cangcang was startled

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.370
and even a bit repulsed.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.010
Her reaction did not look fake.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.770
I'm sure

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.250
she had no idea Bai Chifan would turn up here.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.300
Yes,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.820
everything they said about Southern Chu

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.060
lines up

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.580
and sounds like lived experience,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.890
not something made up.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.460
But neither of them would elaborate

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.370
on what happened after they left Southern Chu.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.580
It's perfectly normal not to speak

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.180
of painful things after a breakup.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.340
Besides, Kumor,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.010
didn't you already test them?

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.220
He didn't know she stole the Phoenix Seal

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.490
or that she secretly joined the army.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.820
It makes sense that he knew nothing about all that

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.300
since they had broken up.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.890
The fact that their stories line up so perfectly

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.460
makes me even more uneasy.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.730
Kumor,

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.340
you're overthinking it.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.010
The peace delegation will arrive sooner or later.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.610
You'll know her identity then,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.820
won't you?

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.220
Besides,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.340
from the way Ling Jueding shot at us without hesitation,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.220
Cangcang is probably not the Empress.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:14.420
More importantly,

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.980
the two of them saved me today.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.700
We can't repay kindness with cruelty, can we?

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.460
You two saved me today.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.730
I'm truly grateful.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.980
Here's a toast to you both.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.610
No need for that, Your Highness.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.980
I only meant to save Cangcang.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.300
Saving you

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.580
was pure coincidence.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.010
Mr. Bai, you traveled all this way for your beloved.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.730
How touching.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.650
General,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.220
I cut ties with this man long ago.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.370
He has nothing to do with me.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.100
Cangcang,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.700
even though we're no longer together,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.300
I can't bear

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.530
to watch you treat yourself like this.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.980
Since we've gone our separate ways,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.610
what I do has nothing

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.700
to do with you.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.370
Knowing you were captured,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.010
of course I was worried.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.890
You know perfectly well what it is

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.730
you're truly worried about.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.770
Miss Lin,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.820
what do you think Mr. Bai is worried about?

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.490
You should ask him.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.420
Cangcang,

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.490
my feelings for you

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.850
are genuine.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.530
Mr. Bai,

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.460
did you come all this way

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.700
only to take your beloved with you?

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.250
Of course.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.730
She may have left me,

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.980
but I still love her.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.300
Today,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.340
Minjia went to the Jiangzhou gates

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.100
on a whim.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.980
Bringing Miss Lin along

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.540
was even more spur-of-the-moment.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.620
So how is it that you

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.010
just happened to be there?

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.850
Were you

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.340
lying in wait near my camp?

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.100
Yes.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.460
You are honest indeed, Mr. Bai.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.890
I knew Cangcang had been taken,

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.730
so I kept watch here day and night.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.100
I wasn't about to let go

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.650
of even the faintest hope.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.180
In this bitter cold,

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.530
night winds cut like knives.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.130
Your devotion to her truly runs deep.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.340
And

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.700
I was rewarded.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.730
I found and saved her.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.530
What if you hadn't saved her?

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:05.980
Then

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.140
I would've died with her.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.420
Very well.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.220
I'll grant that wish

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.090
and let you

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.090
share life and death today.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.570
Guards!

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.700
Yes, General!

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.050
Take these two away.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.220
Yes, General!

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.050
General.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:56.620
Miss Lin,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.860
step outside.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.700
Weren't you going to keep me locked up?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.900
What is this about?

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.290
Come and see.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.330
What is this, General?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.570
Mr. Bai said earlier

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.900
that he kept watch

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.380
near my camp day and night just to rescue you.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.620
Since he's not afraid of Xijiang's freezing winds,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.180
I'd like to see

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.090
how long he can endure them.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.010
I was just worrying about how to shake him off.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.050
Thank you, General, for helping me.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.730
You two were once in love.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.810
Miss Lin, don't you care at all?

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.330
I've already chosen to leave him behind,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.220
so why cling to the past?

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.220
Even so,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.050
he risked his life to rescue you.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.810
Can you really bear to watch him suffer?

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.810
General,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.010
I'm your prisoner now.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:11.980
I can barely protect myself.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.140
How could I worry about anyone else?

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.730
If you beg me,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.980
I might let him go.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.700
If begging really works,

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.530
can I beg you to let me go?

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.490
That's unlikely.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.530
He and I have nothing to do with each other.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.700
You may deal with him as you wish, General.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.330
What a pity.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.010
Your old flame

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.980
doesn't seem to care for you at all.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:19.810
It doesn't matter.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.140
I came here of my own will.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.810
I accept whatever punishment comes my way.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.090
Interesting.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.620
You two...

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.010
One is devoted, while the other

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.620
is indifferent.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.140
Very well.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.570
Enjoy the cold.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.010
Minjia.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.490
Cangcang,

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.860
why did you call for me?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.010
I knew you'd still be awake.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.620
Sit.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.330
I saw

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.460
Bai Chifan

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.620
tied to the pillar.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.050
He looked like he was about to die.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.220
I'm telling you your lover is dying.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.180
Do you really not care?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.420
Former lover.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.980
He's just my former lover.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.860
Why should I care?

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.140
But he's handsome,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.250
skilled,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.980
and absolutely devoted to you.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.010
Don't tell me

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.770
you feel nothing at all.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.770
In my opinion,

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:55.900
life is short.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.660
Outcomes don't matter.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.010
Living each day well

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.460
is what truly matters.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.250
Princess Minjia,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.700
are you feeling sorry for him?

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.140
This isn't pity.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.050
I think he's a good man.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.250
I like him.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.980
If you don't want him,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.180
give him to me.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.980
I don't care about outcomes anyway.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.530
Sure.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.660
You can have him.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.290
But right now,

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.980
he's probably freezing to death thanks to your brother.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.700
Not

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.050
while I'm here.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.620
Xiao Huan,

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.730
this is all I can do for you.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.740
♪Falling petals♪

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.820
♪Petals drifting through the sky♪

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.580
♪Echoes linger♪

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.220
♪In the empty alleys at dawn♪

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.100
♪You used to gaze into my eyes♪

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.100
♪That watchful waiting once warmed a whole city♪

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.220
♪In the embers, a few strands of warmth still remain♪

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.860
♪The sky has faded to dusk♪

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.180
What are you looking at?

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.530
The stars.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.330
They are especially

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.570
bright here.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.700
Haven't you seen stars before?

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.980
It's been two years

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.660
since I

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.140
last looked up properly.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.220
You're unbelievable.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.730
In a situation like this,

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.530
you still care about stargazing?

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.010
At least we're under the same sky now.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.290
That's a kind of bond, isn't it?

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.180
Just sharing

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.380
the same sky is enough for you?

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.290
Being able to see her again at all

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.250
is already a rare blessing.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.570
I doubt I can hope for anything more.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.180
You're easy to satisfy.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.900
Too bad

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.980
she said she didn't care for you anymore.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.420
She's giving you to me.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.620
Your Highness must be joking.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.980
A princess like you

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.330
will find a fine match.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.330
You really are devoted.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.570
Let me warn you,

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.050
the night winds here can freeze cattle and sheep to death.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.660
Aren't you afraid of the cold?

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:47.690
No,

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.050
I'm used to it.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.980
Here, Mr. Bai,

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.530
take this cloak.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.700
Make it through the night.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.090
Kumor,

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.220
I tested

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.980
both of them as you said.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.250
I don't think they're faking it.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.180
Minjia,

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.810
you grew up on the steppe.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.010
You don't know how cunning the Central Plains people can be.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.250
But Kumor,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.180
Bai Chifan saved my life.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.770
If you let him freeze to death,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.250
that wouldn't be right.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.700
Minjia,

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.490
don't tell me you've taken a liking to him.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.330
Of course not.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.980
Why would I fall for someone

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.460
whose heart belongs to another?

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.050
I'm just touched by his devotion.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.220
Don't worry.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.860
He won't die yet.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.420
We'll decide his fate

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.420
after the delegation comes.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.010
Is the hot water ready?

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.770
Yes, Your Highness.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:10.980
The braziers are lit too.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.980
Mr. Bai,

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.660
I've prepared a tent for you.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.330
Take a hot bath once you get there.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.180
I added herbs

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:16.980
to help you warm up.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.140
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.010
Come on,

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:20.980
let's head back.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.180
Didn't expect that.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.250
You braved the northern wind all night and are still standing.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.140
It seems I underestimated you.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.090
I've roamed the martial world for years.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.220
A bit of cold wind

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.490
is nothing.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.420
In that case,

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.490
stay out for a few more nights.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.250
Kumor,

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.530
I'm indebted to Mr. Bai.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.220
I won't let you treat him like this.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.050
Mr. Bai,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.770
let's go.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.220
Is she

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.090
really not the Empress?

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.570
General,

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.180
the delegation from Great Qi is at the gate.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.810
Very well.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.180
Let them in.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:21.810
Yes, General.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.090
Cangcang.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.810
Minjia?

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.530
The delegation from Great Qi is here.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.380
- They're here? - Let's go.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.280
Kumor's waiting for us.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:23.530
Come on.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.770
Du Tingxin, envoy of Great Qi,

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.220
greets General Kumor.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.730
By order of His Majesty,

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.090
I've come to negotiate peace.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.290
Looks like I hold quite a place in the eyes

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.700
of the Emperor of Great Qi.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.250
He actually sent the Imperial Preceptor here.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.700
This shows

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.140
His Majesty's sincerity.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.010
Very well.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.140
Then let me show your emperor

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.700
my sincerity as well.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.490
Bring her up!

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.810
General.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:50.700
Preceptor Du,

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.730
aren't you going to kneel before your empress?

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.660
The Empress?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.220
Where?

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.810
Didn't the Emperor of Great Qi

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.990
receive my letter?

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.490
Calm down, General.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.770
I came precisely to address this matter.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.330
This is a handwritten letter from His Majesty.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.250
Please see for yourself.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.500
[The Phoenix Seal of Great Qi recently went missing.]

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.900
[I heard it was found by General Kumor, so I sent a delegation]

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.100
[to retrieve the stolen seal, reclaim the captives, and negotiate peace.]

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.090
The Empress of Great Qi is still in the palace?

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.010
Yes.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.940
Her Majesty is safe and sound.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.570
His Majesty sent this delegation

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.290
to retrieve the stolen Phoenix Seal,

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:03.570
reclaim the captives,

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.250
and negotiate terms

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.620
for peace.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.010
Preceptor Du,

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.010
do you know this woman?

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.090
This is the thief?

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.490
How dare you steal the Phoenix Seal?

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.570
Your crime is unforgivable!

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.570
Guards,

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.940
take her back to Jiangzhou for punishment!

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.730
- Wait. - Understood.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.810
No need for all that trouble.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.140
According to custom in Xijiang,

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.620
a thief's right hand is chopped off in public

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.860
and thrown in the wilderness to feed the wolves.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.220
In that case,

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.620
let's follow local custom.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.220
Do you have anything to say?

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.620
General,

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.620
to the Imperial Preceptor,

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.900
I am indeed a thief who stole the Phoenix Seal.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.460
I have nothing to say.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.250
Please do the honors, Preceptor Du.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.090
Then please have your men

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.770
hold the thief down.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.290
Preceptor Du, your inner force may be mediocre,

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.700
but your resolve to chop off her hand is admirable.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.090
What is it?

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.180
Have you changed your mind about punishing her?

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:05.860
Since she is not the Empress of Great Qi,

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.290
her matter can wait.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.090
Let us discuss real business.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.490
Since you were sent by the Emperor of Great Qi,

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.700
you must have brought some token of sincerity.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:23.530
Bring it up!

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:46.770
What is this?

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.150
Do you think you can

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.090
buy me off with a bit of money?

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.010
This is 3,128 liang and nine qian of gold.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.900
It is not "a bit of money."

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.570
This is the money people in Xijiang paid to purchase proper status

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.380
after the status verification system was implemented last year.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.220
I had the Ministry of Revenue convert it into gold

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:09.210
and brought it here to you.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.570
I didn't go through all this trouble

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.010
for a bit of gold.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.940
Since the status verification system was enforced,

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.610
those without proper status have been reduced to slaves.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.740
Ordinary folk have had no choice but to purchase good status.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.530
How is this any different from daylight robbery?

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.900
If the system is not abolished,

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.130
this gold you brought

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.610
will be nothing but a drop in the ocean.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.820
General, mind your words.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.170
The status verification system is a national policy

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.820
established to maintain order.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.300
How can it be abolished so easily?

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.880
You are mistaken, Preceptor Du.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.460
Only when all people are free and equal

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.460
can the land be at peace.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.740
As I see it,

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.610
the status verification system

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.050
is the very cause of chaos in the land.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.530
I am merely carrying out orders

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.780
to deliver this gold to you, General.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.340
Matters regarding the system

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.130
are not for me to decide.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.090
I've heard you're the Emperor of Great Qi's trusted aide.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.900
Seeing you today,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.980
I can't imagine why.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.010
I will report your thoughts

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.530
to His Majesty.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:22.980
Good.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.260
Please do.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.110
When you decide to abolish

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.900
the status verification system,

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.090
I will consider

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:33.480
when to withdraw my troops.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:36.610
General, are you truly turning down

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:40.050
3,000 liang of gold?

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.380
Did I say I was?

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.900
Aren't the Phoenix Seal and the captives

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.340
worth 3,000 liang of gold?

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.410
General, how bold you are.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.530
Very well.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.180
In that case,

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.490
the gold is yours.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.700
As for the captives, the Phoenix Seal, and her,

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.130
I'm taking them all.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.780
Preceptor Du, you are being a bit too greedy.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.660
You may take the captives.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.860
As for the Phoenix Seal and her,

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.860
you may choose only one.

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.700
Then please, chop off her hand

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.300
and feed it to the wolves for me.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.010
As for the Phoenix Seal and her,

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.090
you may choose only one.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:48.300
Then please, chop off her hand

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.970
and feed it to the wolves for me.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.700
The Preceptor never intended to take me away.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.410
Was she acting on his orders?

00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.740
No matter.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.610
I am no longer the Empress of Great Qi.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.050
Why should I care what he wants?

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.860
If the Preceptor can at least tell Jueding

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.860
that I'm safe,

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.260
it will put his mind at ease.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.940
If I can use this opportunity

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.010
to learn the Black Tiger Army's defenses...

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.260
What are you thinking?

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.340
Nothing.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.980
Are you sad?

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:25.940
Of course.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.530
All the captives have left.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:29.900
I'm the only one left behind.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.260
General, you don't still think

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.490
I'm the Empress of Great Qi, do you?

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.210
To be honest,

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.210
I still have a tiny bit of doubt.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.130
But right now,

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.380
I see no reason

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.610
to believe you are.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.260
Then what do you plan to do with me?

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.690
I intend

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.860
to treat you two

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.210
as honored guests.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:05.900
When the war ends,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.940
I will see you both off myself.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.860
This is how you treat honored guests?

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.780
You're practically putting me under house arrest.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.860
Inside the camp,

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.780
you two are free to go wherever you like.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.460
But if either of you steps outside,

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.860
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.170
All right.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.610
Since you're so "hospitable,"

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.690
I suppose

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.090
I'll stay.

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.090
But there is one thing I don't understand.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.260
Now that you know I'm not the Empress,

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.300
why

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.860
haven't you killed me?

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.780
I can't bear to.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.460
I just think

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.490
that you are a woman of honor.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.460
You stole provisions to save the people.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.170
I admire that.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.530
Rest assured.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:06.170
Since I said

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.980
I'd treat you as honored guests,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.740
I'll keep my word.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.050
Good.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.420
Your Highness.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.690
Mr. Bai,

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.610
are you better now?

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.820
Thank you for the cloak.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.010
Cangcang?

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.740
She should have left with the delegation.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.610
Why is she still here?

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.380
Yes, that's Cangcang.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.210
What's wrong?

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.610
Nothing.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:39:59.820
Did

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.610
the delegation from Great Qi come today?

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:02.340
They did.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.130
And they've already left.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.610
Can you believe my brother?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.740
Earlier,

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.340
he suspected that Lin Cangcang was the Empress

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.260
and even had me follow the two of you.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:12.460
Only when the delegation

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.170
confirmed her identity today

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.260
did he finally relax.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.900
If you ask me,

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.860
the whole thing is simple.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.210
If Cangcang were the Empress,

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.130
wouldn't that

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:25.090
make you the Emperor?

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:27.380
Exactly.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.420
[Qi]

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.780
General.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:42.900
Greetings,

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.010
Preceptor Du.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.380
General Ling,

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.610
no need to look around.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.010
Her Majesty

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.490
is not with us.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.300
Why not?

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.900
Kumor made me choose between the 300 captives

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.530
and Her Majesty,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.090
but she would rather die than admit who she was.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.530
I had no choice but to respect her wishes,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.980
so I only retrieved the stolen Phoenix Seal

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.210
and brought back the captives.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.690
Then what about my sister?

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.690
Her Majesty put the greater good first.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.210
Heaven will watch over her.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.050
I will also

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.860
pray for her safety day and night.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:36.420
Cangcang.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.740
Minjia?

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.340
Why are you staying in your tent all the time?

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.380
Why not go out for a walk?

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.530
What's the point?

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.900
I can't leave the camp anyway.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:47.420
What,

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.130
do you know somewhere worth going?

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.090
I wish.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.170
I still have to clean the stables this afternoon.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.380
Clean the stables?

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:57.610
A princess like you cleans the stables yourself?

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:58.460
Of course.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:59.740
As my brother says,

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.340
there are no princesses in the camp,

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.420
only soldiers.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.130
If I want to stay here,

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.260
I have to work like everyone else.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.100
Anyway, enough about that.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:09.570
I snuck out

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.210
to chat with you.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.820
About what?

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.340
If it's about Bai Chifan,

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.610
forget it.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.260
That's exactly what I want to talk about.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.490
Why did you break up with him?

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:24.690
He clearly cares for you deeply.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.260
I used to think so too.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.380
Only later did I realize

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.010
he had ulterior motives.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:37.740
Mr. Bai is not that kind of man.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.610
He risked his life to save you.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:41.010
Enough.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.210
I don't want to talk about him.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.420
I bet

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:55.900
you still have feelings for him.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.050
If you truly didn't care,

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.610
you wouldn't sound so bitter.

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.210
You say you've moved on,

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:04.780
but you still hold grudges.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:06.610
If you ask me,

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:08.610
your anger

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.860
comes from love.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.780
Really?

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.050
I hit the mark, didn't I?
